fuck. well it‚Äôs better to know than not. I have a personal drama regarding feedback submission‚Ä¶ spent a good while <em>very</em> thoroughly documenting the peculiar/inconsistent responses to bluetooth keyboard commands within Safari (on iPhone, notably.) I did the full log file which took me like 3 days of trying to get it to upload correctly‚Ä¶ and I even recorded a live-annotated screen recording of me reproducing it.</p>

<p>and‚Ä¶ well. shall we see if it‚Äôs gotten any sort of acknowledgement, even, since the last time I looked? lmao</p>

<p>[04&#8211;13&#8211;2021 01:13 PM] David Blue#1917
I realize whining over lack of replies to one‚Äôs bug reports is absolutely absurd - or rather, that it <em>would</em> be absolutely absurd in any case not involving the most valuable company in the history of the world.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;15&#8211;2021 01:15 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I definitely don&#8217;t get replies to any feedback, that&#8217;s not really the point of the system. I get that it sucks but they just don&#8217;t use it to communicate back</p>

<p>[04&#8211;42&#8211;2021 01:42 PM] David Blue#1917
oh I don‚Äôt care if they respond <em>to me</em>. not one bit. it‚Äôs just quite clear from what I‚Äôve learned from other developers recently that <em>addressing the issue at all</em> almost certainly hasnt happened.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;43&#8211;2021 01:43 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
It always depends on what it is. I‚Äôve seen Apple engineers get to something that‚Äôs been on their list for years but just can‚Äôt fit in with other priorities</p>

<p>[04&#8211;46&#8211;2021 01:46 PM] David Blue#1917
and again‚Ä¶ Apple just not doing stuff like marking the issue as received and understood <em>because they just don‚Äôt do that</em> cannot fly when we‚Äôre talking GDP levels of pure profit quarterly. it is embarrassing.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;47&#8211;2021 01:47 PM] David Blue#1917
also understand that‚Ä¶ sorta. still gotta yell about it.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;47&#8211;2021 01:47 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
They make those profits because they don‚Äôt spend time responding to feedback and just fix it</p>

<p>[04&#8211;48&#8211;2021 01:48 PM] David Blue#1917
EXACTLY!!!</p>

<p>[04&#8211;49&#8211;2021 01:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
My point is that the value of each engineer is astronomical, and if they used this as ticketing system and not bug reporting they‚Äôd never get anything done.</p>

<p>They are whole jobs who just sort the reports, the engineers have thousands to prioritize with real feature</p>

<p>[04&#8211;50&#8211;2021 01:50 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
And also profit comes from charging for storage so those can‚Äôt be aligned to argue why they didn‚Äôt respond to your feedback</p>

<p>[04&#8211;51&#8211;2021 01:51 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I get it man, you just can‚Äôt hold it against them</p>

<p>[04&#8211;51&#8211;2021 01:51 PM] David Blue#1917
yeah I‚Äôm sorry to bring my specific abstract business rant in here lol‚Ä¶ I fundamentally don‚Äôt understand the priorities behind proprietary software development at all.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;52&#8211;2021 01:52 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Working there taught me how much time it takes to do so little with development</p>

<p>[04&#8211;53&#8211;2021 01:53 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always iterative, and year after year we start to get amazing features built on the history of what‚Äôs already there. And a billion bugs come along with it, Apple has massive technical debt</p>

<p>[04&#8211;53&#8211;2021 01:53 PM] David Blue#1917
but documentation is an obligation and I <em>will</em> hold that against them mostly because I suspect basically everybody there would agree‚Ä¶ yet those toys tho‚Ä¶</p>

<p>[04&#8211;53&#8211;2021 01:53 PM] David Blue#1917
thank god for apple bein slow lol</p>

<p>[04&#8211;54&#8211;2021 01:54 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I just wouldn‚Äôt assume stuff like that, that‚Äôs an ideal but not realistic at a scale they‚Äôre at. Their docs suck</p>

<p>[04&#8211;55&#8211;2021 01:55 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Apple‚Äôs system has tons of problems but it‚Äôs the one we have to work with, so I‚Äôm more focused on how to give them productive feedback and sharing it publicly and not getting hung up on one piece of it</p>

<p>[04&#8211;58&#8211;2021 01:58 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Writing up something specific like that is a good way to bring attention to it, send it to Michael J Tsai</p>

<p>[04&#8211;59&#8211;2021 01:59 PM] David Blue#1917
and thank god for that‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm gonna prioritize the open source stuff i beta test in terms of feedback, but I want to be more like you in that regard.</p>

<p>honestly if actual tech media hadn‚Äôt lost their jive when it comes to critically reporting on apple in a <em>useful</em> sense, i would be free to make my endless keyboard reference tables in peace.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;59&#8211;2021 01:59 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I think individuals doing that is better than publications</p>

<p>[04&#8211;01&#8211;2021 02:01 PM] David Blue#1917
considering my <strong>Persistent Siri</strong> conundrum a while back‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to think my specific library/behavior/device even must have something to do with it. which I realize is probably what I should focus on.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] David Blue#1917
honestly tho the 15 year old in me loves nothing more than bugs like that happening at random lol</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I have similar issues too, I do think occasionally resetting the device fully can help</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Which also blows</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
But I‚Äôd rather have it work</p>

<p>[04&#8211;05&#8211;2021 02:05 PM] David Blue#1917
yeah‚Ä¶ my perspective on my cellular is completely off considering <em>I do not leave my home.</em></p>

<p>[04&#8211;31&#8211;2021 04:31 PM] EconWriter#1131
Thanks for filing that feedback in such a detailed fashion. I&#8217;ve had the same problems with Safari in iOS, but was resigned to just living with it since I realize I&#8217;m an edge case who uses my iPhone in a very unique way (and I know you&#8217;re on that tail of the distribution with me). So thanks for putting the work in!</p>

<p>[04&#8211;40&#8211;2021 07:40 PM] David Blue#1917
that is basically my life purpose at this point so thank <em>you</em>. I have been thinking about the best way to bring together ‚Äúpeople like us.‚Äù not like‚Ä¶ in the annual convention sense (though that would make for one absolutely perplexing image for those who still don‚Äôt know/haven‚Äôt considered hehe.</p>

<p>a website, maybe? or maybe just a subreddit.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;42&#8211;2021 07:42 PM] David Blue#1917
not appropriate to continue on that here, but - if you haven‚Äôt tried out iOS 15 yet‚Ä¶ i have bad news, I‚Äôm afraid. they seem to have broken calling spotlight with ‚Äò ‚åò + Spacebar ‚Äô again‚Ä¶</p>

<p>[04&#8211;42&#8211;2021 07:42 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @David Blue, you just advanced to level 5!</p>

<p>[04&#8211;45&#8211;2021 07:45 PM] David Blue#1917
it always calls but doesn‚Äôt always deliver selection (cursor) back to the text field.</p>

<p>come to think of it, <strong>I should get on reporting this right now.</strong> ..</p>

<p>[05&#8211;11&#8211;2021 03:11 AM] quickfinga#4862
I have this problem since iOS 14 dev beta 1 and reported it. Never got fixed.</p>

<p>[05&#8211;28&#8211;2021 03:28 AM] David Blue#1917
can I ask how often? and on which sort of device?</p>

<p>[05&#8211;14&#8211;2021 04:14 AM] quickfinga#4862
iPad Pro 11 2020. Hard to say how often it happens‚Ä¶often enough that I filed feedback. üòÖ</p>

<p>[05&#8211;45&#8211;2021 04:45 PM] David Blue#1917
now just imagine if that was your ONLY way of app switching!!! basically a dead stop on iPhone.</p>

<p>[05&#8211;50&#8211;2021 04:50 PM] David Blue#1917
when spotlight is working correctly, though, it is a truly incredible tool. I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I figure I‚Äôm as fast at switching-by-searching as anyone should ever endeavor to be on their cellular lol.
