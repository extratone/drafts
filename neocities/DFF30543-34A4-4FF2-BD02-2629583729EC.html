<li><p>By design or not, The Ratio <em>fundamentally</em> disincentivizes discovery, sincere exposure to new perspectives, and indeed most of what we constitute as “human connection.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ultimately, I don&#8217;t really have a choice but to continue using Twitter as I always have, so I&#8217;m going to make the most of it and continue to post whenever and whatever I, myself, would like to see on my timeline - even if my account ends up in such low opinion of The Twitter Algorithm that my Tweets become obfuscated entirely from everywhere on the site save for their full, canonical web addresses, which I will then publish via plain text files hosted on my NeoCities.</p></li>
<li><p> Disclose: the excerpt from <a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/The-Day-of-Reformed-Precocity-1bbbb5f6369646fbae7024c3295523e4">my astrology</a> about indiscriminately viewing my work.</p>

<h2>Assumptions in Question</h2>

<ol>
<li>For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will <em>ever</em> result in a substantial accumulation of money/&#8220;influence&#8221; (which seems to be the diluted zag of &#8220;POWER&#8221; of the moment.) Those interested in learning about &#8220;marketing&#8221; should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to <em>start</em> with Twitter - this I can say with certainty.</li>
<li>Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user&#8217;s choices/methodology to produce results which we <em>have</em>, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was <em>not</em> created as a <em>game to be won</em>. Perhaps more importantly, the &#8220;prize&#8221; of &#8220;winning&#8221; in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, &#8220;influence,&#8221; relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.</li>
<li>If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with <em>both</em> strangers and friends in a manner which generally <strong>adds value to the lives of all involved</strong>.</li>
<li>3 is not only <em>possible</em> - it is easily <em>reproducible</em>. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples.</li>
<li>Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, <strong>neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Specific public examples of positively-acting individual accounts</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem">Jon Male</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/thesmokingtire">Matt Farah</a> - An example of a celebrity who for the most part sticks to subjects on which he is an authority and invests a lot of intellectual and emotional energy engaging in discussion. In turn, he is also an example of someone who is <em>actually</em> “leveraging” his social media use for his business, but in a way that adds value to everybody’s lives.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The exchange of <strong>information or services</strong> among individuals, groups, or institutions.
<em>Specifically</em>, the cultivation of <strong>productive relationships</strong> for employment or business.</p>

<p>If you follow more people than follow you, what you are in essence saying to that person is &#8220;I followed all these people, but only some of them found me interesting enough to follow me back.&#8221;
Not only that, but you are also saying &#8220;Yes, I may have recently followed you, but don&#8217;t take it too personally, I like to follow a lot of people, so really, the fact that I cared enough to follow you doesn&#8217;t mean I am genuinely interested in what you have to say.&#8221;

<p> There was something pleasant about meandering from conversation to conversation, as if I had walked into my own home to find a conference in full swing. But I also wondered, Why did I let all of these people into my house?

 It is hard to shake the feeling that everyone on Clubhouse is selling something: a company, a workshop, a show, a book, a brand.</p>

<h2>Tinder BS</h2>

<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284420/tinder-ceo-elie-seidman-interview-dating-pandemic">Tinder CEO Elie Seidman on finding love during the pandemic</a>&#8221; | <em>The Verge</em></p>

<p><strong>NP: Once you find the something more, you probably don’t want to go back to an environment where everyone’s intent is to get to something more. Do you anticipate people are going to spend a long time in Tinder, that they’re going to come back to it again and again throughout their life, or is it once you make the connection, you move on?</strong></p>

<p>We already see episodic behavior, which makes sense. If you find somebody, you get really connected to them, you date them, it’s maybe a long term relationship. We’re really the only app which says, ==“Just because it doesn’t last forever, doesn’t mean it’s not important.”== It’s still important, and we’re very clear about that. We don’t think everything has to last to be important. As a result, we see very clearly episodic use.</p>

<p>People come, they come for a while, they leave, they come back. If that starts at 18, it’s a journey, and they spend their time on that journey. I don’t think this will change that. I very much hope and expect that people will still form important connections, even if they don’t last forever.</p>
