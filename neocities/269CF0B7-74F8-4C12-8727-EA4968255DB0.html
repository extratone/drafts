<h2>A commitment to share my thoughts where developers actually want them, and an invitation for other reviewers/users to join me.</h2>

<!--more-->

<p>I have written more than my fair share of words about software, as I have loved, despised, and been utterly perplexed by it. This year, my return to the iOS community has perhaps inevitably turned <em>apps</em> into an addiction of sorts. This particular platform is so utterly chock full/stocked up of creativity at a scale immeasurably greater and more accessible than the whole of those throughout computing history, combined. For someone like myself, it is all too easy to allow oneself to wander down a virtually endless path of intriguing, very self-indulgent play, especially now that third-party sites like <a href="https://departures.to">Departures.to</a> have managed to add discoverability to TestFlight beta distributions, allowing those non-millionaires among us opportunities to use test releases of applications we would’ve otherwise had to pay for. This has been exclusively to my benefit - I can only imagine what 15 year-old me would have done with such power.</p>

<p>In my recent endeavor to focus on making my work more useful to others, I&#8217;ve reflected on something I&#8217;ve heard from nigh every developer of the apps I&#8217;ve reviewed: <em>Ah yes, your blog looks really cool but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE REVIEW MY FUCKING APP on the FUCKING STORE.</em> Read: your commentary is appreciated, but your five stars would almost certainly more economically beneficial.</p>

<p>As you can see from the image embedded above, I have personally fallen <em>very</em> behind in doing my part for those apps I&#8217;ve celebrated, here. A vague intention to <em>get around to it eventually</em> clearly is not working, so I&#8217;ve decided to give myself a deadline: <strong>August 15th, 2021</strong> - precisely one month from today. By this date, I will have sifted through my commentary on apps in this setting and adapted the most useful of it (per app, obviously) into a manner appropriate to appear on an App Store Page, and <strong>I would like to formally-ish invite other tech writers/app reviewers to join me</strong>.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318</p>

<p>I&#8217;m terrible at community organization, which certainly does not exclude events, so I very much welcome any feedback you might have, as well as any collaborative contributions you&#8217;d be interested in making. As I see it, I have a few essential considerations to offer.</p>

<p>First, the page in the screen capture above - which can be found in the App Store App ⇨ Account (your profile picture in the top-right corner) ⇨ Account Settings (the tapable element at the very top with your profile picture and information) ⇨ Ratings and Reviews - is <em>broken as hell</em>, along with the rest of the Account Settings menu, notably. This is important because I insist we all complain about it on all available channels, considering it&#8217;s been broken for several months, at least.</p>

<p>Second, you should almost certainly use <a href="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/"><strong>this &#8220;new&#8221; dev-facing tool</strong></a> when searching the App Store, considering that it <em>actually works</em> in a trustable way, unlike the user-facing tool in the app.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1415732070626758663</p>

<p>Since the standard online palette of event organization software are all so easy to use, these days, I&#8217;ve established event pages for this event on multiple platforms, linked in the list below, which I will update as per any suggestions/requests for equivalent pages on other services. Of course, it&#8217;s certainly not a requirement that you join/engage with any of them.</p>

<p>One could could certainly just add the date to their own calendar (conveniently with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WM2esll-Yf5Fg4gO9ZYVAJ0pPrdexGqF/view?usp=sharing">this .ics file</a>,) remain entirely silent about the thing on social, and still be participating. Those interested in further engagement, however, can Chat Me Up on <a href="https://bit.ly/extratone"><em>Extratone</em>&#8217;s Discord</a>, the <a href="https://teams.live.com/meet/93913819139325">Teams event chat</a>, <a href="https://t.me/extratoe">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://davidblue.wtf">etc</a>. I also plan to reshare most of this post as <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1415732070626758663">a thread on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>As we face the horrendous, utterly inexcusable state of Discovery on the App Store/Apple&#8217;s general fuckery regarding the independent developers mostly responsible for making its platforms a worthwhile space, I hope I&#8217;ve created something of value in whipping up this &#8220;event.&#8221; If you have thoughts on how I might do so more effectively, once again, <em>please do</em> reach out.</p>
