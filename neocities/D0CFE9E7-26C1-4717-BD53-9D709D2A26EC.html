<p>I legitimately believe &#8220;silicon valley&#8221; would do us all good if they&#8217;d just respond (entirely within their legal right when talking about content on their platforms!!) <strong>&#8220;uhhh actually yeah we can. bye bitch&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>I had a very lengthy and mostly reasonable conversation with (generally conservative leaning) siblings a few weeks ago that was particularly illuminating, personally. when I brought up that capitalism&#8217;s property rights pretty clearly indicate that privately-owned platforms are completely free to be modified by their owners however they wish, they were&#8230; confused&#8230;. bringing up &#8220;letters&#8221; sent by &#8220;senators&#8221; to &#8220;Twitter and Facebook&#8221; which led to &#8220;bans.&#8221; when I responded by insisting that hypothetical would <em>also</em> not only be entirely within the law, but a pretty classic practice in American capitalism, they responded &#8220;that&#8217;s not right.&#8221;</p>

<p>separately but with the same assumptions, they really got angry with me when I insisted that private businesses have every right to require potential new employees be vaccinated before they onboard, and that their business incentive (customer safety) actually represented a great example to cite in an argument for the free market&#8217;s positive societal outcomes, they were just like <em>no, it&#8217;s socialist.</em></p>

<p>I guess I realized all at once that the right&#8217;s basic assumptions about what Capitalism is/was ~~have been~~ are <strong>fucked</strong>. which is annoying.</p>

<hr />

<p>while I feel this is definitely reflected now, I have some trouble with <em>has always been</em>. I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my late stepfather (who died in 2014.) he was very much a card-carrying Republican who spent most of his career working in management/consulting for big oil companies, but (as I remember him, anyway,) he spent <em>a lot</em> of time looking for new perspectives and was genuinely curious/a good listener.</p>

<p>specifically, I watched him go through what was for him a very arduous process in accepting climate change as a consequence largely of the industry he put so much of himself in. like&#8230; painful. I would come home after school and he would pop out of his office and bring up el nino&#8230; I&#8217;m sure basically his entire social circle was assaulting him both directly and indirectly with denial in all its oughts forms&#8230; but he never condemned anyone or refused to listen to anything. the facts <em>truly bothered him</em> and he chose to face them. he finally gave in around 2012&#8211;13 and was relatively vocal about it.</p>

<p>I wonder what he would have to say to his party every day now, basically.</p>

<p>(apologies for the verbosity I guess most of this wasn&#8217;t entirely relevant lol&#8230;. it&#8217;s becoming clear to me that I should be writing about him elsewhere.)</p>

<p>I swear there was more <em>dignity</em> there at some definitive point in the past&#8230; maybe not.</p>
