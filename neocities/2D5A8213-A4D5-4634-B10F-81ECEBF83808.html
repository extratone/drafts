<p>Hey guys, this is definitely a <em>sensitive subject</em> for me, you might say (lol,) so - before I reply - I want to <strong>ask for your validation right quick.</strong></p>

<p>If you can/are willing/would like to read both my question and the â€œFramework Engineerâ€â€™s answer in their entirety and share your thoughts on whether or not it was answered/anything elseâ€¦
Iâ€™d very much appreciate it.</p>

<p>[20&#8211;38&#8211;2021 08:38 AM] lightningxcookie#0469
The answer you got seems like a non-answer. To me it feels like a typical Apple PR comment where what they really mean is <em>â€œno commentâ€</em> or <em>â€œwhat youâ€™re looking for doesnâ€™t existâ€</em>. I assume the latter is true in this case, which is unfortunate.</p>

thanks for reading it! alrightâ€¦ thanks you to you, I have achieved <strong>Validated Status</strong> and am ready to begin Tearing Framework Engineer an Entirely New Digestive System.</p>

<p>[20&#8211;42&#8211;2021 11:42 AM] koshakji#0791
I donâ€™t see whatâ€™s wrong with the answer they gave. They said you donâ€™t need unique iPhone considerations, what exactly do you want/expect them to do?</p>

<p>[20&#8211;43&#8211;2021 11:43 AM] koshakji#0791
If thereâ€™s no more documentation than the things they shared, thereâ€™s no more documentation. I donâ€™t see what they did wrong</p>

<p>[20&#8211;44&#8211;2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
itâ€™s not about doing things right or wrongâ€¦ I was joking about the beef lol. nobody owes <em>me</em> anythingâ€¦ Iâ€™d just like to figure out how I can get them to see itâ€™d be to <em>their</em> advantage to check again.</p>

<p>[20&#8211;44&#8211;2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
on this, specifically, they need to uhâ€¦ check again. there are definite differences in support between the two devices.</p>

<p>[20&#8211;50&#8211;2021 11:50 AM] David Blue#1917
I would also just like to not have to write all the keyboard shortcuts tables myself, ya know? Iâ€™ve been doing it for years but thereâ€™s only so much I can do with just blind testing. I keep discovering new shortcuts that would have been really nice to know about uhâ€¦ 10 years ago.</p>

<p>[20&#8211;51&#8211;2021 11:51 AM] David Blue#1917
On that note, <code>Shift + âŒ˜ + ][</code> doing some real crazy shit on Safari rn if anyone wants to try it lol</p>

<p>[20&#8211;51&#8211;2021 01:51 PM] koshakji#0791
I guess you do you, but I feel like youâ€™re overreacting to a support person providing the answer they can provide</p>

<p>[20&#8211;33&#8211;2021 03:33 PM] David Blue#1917
I donâ€™t want to do anything but bring the issue to light, right? im not trying to <em>receive</em> somethingâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to encourage this person to wonder why there arenâ€™t any docsâ€¦ maybe ask their boss.</p>

<p>[20&#8211;34&#8211;2021 03:34 PM] David Blue#1917
now if the answer to that question is <em>I donâ€™t care</em>â€¦ <strong>that</strong> would be problematic.</p>

<p>[20&#8211;07&#8211;2021 04:07 PM] mvan231#3698
Seems like this conversation is not shortcuts related anyway</p>

I agree, let&#8217;s keep these channels related to the topic at hand @David Blue</p>

I also do want to emphasize that railing against support people is not the kind of thing I want to do in this community. Griping against people who don&#8217;t have almost any influence on the system isn&#8217;t okay, even if its framed as being in jestÂ â€“ I want to foster an environment where feedback from this community is notoriously positive and constructive</p>
