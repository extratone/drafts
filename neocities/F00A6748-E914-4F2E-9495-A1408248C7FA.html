<blockquote>
<p>Hello Min folks! I haven‚Äôt been so excited to find out about a project‚Äôs Discord server launch in a long time!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Min‚Äôs developers live in Missouri? Don‚Äôt want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I live in Columbia, MO, and would basically love the opportunity to frame it as ‚Ä¶. not like ‚Äúgrass roots software,‚Äù or anything‚Ä¶ idk. I guess I would like to think the fact that Min‚Äôs developmental priorities make so much more sense (for my own use, yes, but also for the average user‚Äôs) than any other web browser I‚Äôve ever encountered might have something to do with its creators‚Äô distance from the Wacky Fantasy World on the West Coast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>anywho, I‚Äôm David Blue and I‚Äôve put off writing about Min for far too long. very glad to be here.</p>

<p>I also wanted to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôve taken the opportunity provided by a membership discount to give 1Password a chance again (which is not going well, in case you were wondering lol,) so I took a sec to try out your integration with it last night‚Ä¶ and my god‚Ä¶ utterly genius. notably the most abstracted installation/integration with a CLI I‚Äôve ever seen, generally, which is. incredible because it actually works!! (so far.) just makes everybody else‚Äôs insistence on using browser extensions to accomplish this look utterly daft lmao</p>

Hey, thanks! I‚Äôm not sure how much the development priorities are a result of location (and I just moved here a year ago, so I‚Äôm not really a ‚Äúmissourian‚Äù), but it‚Äôs good to know it‚Äôs working well for you!
The CLI integration was a result of extensions being too much work to support, rather than an intentional design decision üôÇ And you end up missing a bunch of features present in the real extension. But the installation flow does work pretty well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>almost as if thought aimed at working around constraints leads to clever solutions‚Ä¶ hehe ‚ù§Ô∏è 1Password has grown in completely irrelevant, cloud-native features ((<em>password sharing</em>??? wtf???)) whilst letting their actual software (as in‚Ä¶ the Windows client) rot to hell. makes for a wonderful combination, as you might imagine. I was a 1Password beta tester when I was like 15 or something‚Ä¶ it was the entirety of password management as a concept (as far as I was concerned) for years and years. I cannot tell you how many people I have annoyed to death with 1Password evangelism in my lifetime and yet‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Enpass is more dependable and far quicker in (my) real world anyway.</p>
