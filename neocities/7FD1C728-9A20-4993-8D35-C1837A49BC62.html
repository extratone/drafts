Topic: Discussing the developer/public beta versions of Shortcuts</h1>

<p>[12&#8211;35&#8211;2019 01:35 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
At some point, maybe in the recent developer betas of iOS, ‚Äútap to scroll to top‚Äù while selecting a shortcut was fixed and I am very happy</p>

<p>[12&#8211;36&#8211;2019 01:36 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Now I can select a shortcut and move it to the top or bottom immediately</p>

<p>[12&#8211;58&#8211;2019 01:58 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Wait even weirder, it might only work while I am using the Apple Pencil - since there‚Äôs no ‚Äútouch‚Äù input registered, I can still tap to scroll to top. But when I‚Äôm not using the pencil it doesn‚Äôt work&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh well, it works! ü§∑</p>

<p>[03&#8211;35&#8211;2019 09:35 PM] HilliTech#2480
I have the old shortcuts app on my iPad Pro but the new one on my iphone? Hmmmm</p>

<p>[04&#8211;28&#8211;2019 12:28 AM] BastianInuk#2009
you on 13? üòÆ</p>

<p>[04&#8211;30&#8211;2019 01:30 AM] HilliTech#2480
I‚Äôm on the dev beta on every device. iPhone, iPad Pro, iPad mini, Mac mini, Apple Watch</p>

<p>[04&#8211;40&#8211;2019 02:40 AM] BastianInuk#2009
damn!</p>

<p>[04&#8211;41&#8211;2019 02:41 AM] BastianInuk#2009
I can&#8217;t unxib xcode, and my iPhone won&#8217;t show in finder</p>

<p>[04&#8211;36&#8211;2019 09:36 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
I am only on the beta on my 11‚Äù iPad. Because lots of apps are not launching for me.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;42&#8211;2019 09:42 AM] HilliTech#2480
Luckily my photography and writing apps are all that is crucial, so updating wasn‚Äôt too much of a danger. Most everything is smooth here</p>

<p>[04&#8211;43&#8211;2019 09:43 AM] HilliTech#2480
App grouping is broken when trying to add an app to split view that isnt in the dock. That is my biggest annoyance so far</p>

<p>[04&#8211;44&#8211;2019 09:44 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Yeah that was in the release notes.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;44&#8211;2019 09:44 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
I‚Äôm having to live vicariously through you @HilliTech</p>

<p>[04&#8211;44&#8211;2019 09:44 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
No Mac to flash the beta.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;46&#8211;2019 09:46 AM] HilliTech#2480
üò¢ beta 2s drop a week or two from the first one. And since this one is buggy we should see an update sooner rather than later</p>

<p>[04&#8211;47&#8211;2019 09:47 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
I‚Äôm hopeful that it‚Äôll go back to profiles before the public beta.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;48&#8211;2019 09:48 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
As I said in our message group Hilli, wanting to make some training materials for teachers that cover iPadOS</p>

<p>[04&#8211;49&#8211;2019 09:49 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
With the oldest devices being iPad 2 and iPad mini 4 offering support, lots of schools will need support on new features and ways of working.</p>

<p>[07&#8211;24&#8211;2019 03:24 PM] Kieran Mansfield#5416
I‚Äôm very tempted to install iOS 13 when the public beta comes out as long as it‚Äôs not as buggy as iOS 11 üòÇ</p>

<p>[07&#8211;26&#8211;2019 03:26 PM] BastianInuk#2009
I am not saying it&#8217;s buggy</p>

<p>[07&#8211;27&#8211;2019 03:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
But I got 6 inquiries in feedback app</p>

<p>[07&#8211;13&#8211;2019 06:13 PM] Kieran Mansfield#5416
Also 3D Touch has been replaced with haptic touch and apparently it‚Äôs slow and not great&#8230; üôÑ</p>

<p>[07&#8211;06&#8211;2019 10:06 PM] HilliTech#2480
Its hard to judge that based on beta 1. Could be an issue with deployment targets being glitched. We shall see what they intend in later betas.</p>

<p>[12&#8211;13&#8211;2019 06:13 AM] koshakji#0791
Does Siri show the list and ask for selection if you have a Choose from List action in a Shortcut?</p>

<p>[12&#8211;03&#8211;2019 08:03 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Thats me on the Catalina and iPadOS betas. So far they seem fine. iPadOS is stable on my Pro. I pushed Catalina hard on this 2014 Mac mini yesterday and it struggled. Think it may have been the mac more than anything else.</p>

<p>[12&#8211;03&#8211;2019 08:03 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Today its fine. Installed iPadOS no problem despite issues yesterday.</p>

<p>[12&#8211;41&#8211;2019 12:41 PM] Verso#7005
I tend to stick to the Star Trek Movie rule of betas: Only bother with the even numbered ones (:</p>

@koshakji Most of the Siri stuff isn‚Äôt working in b1, but yes it should work</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2019 02:51 PM] koshakji#0791
That&#8217;s awesome! I was afraid it was just for 3rd party apps</p>

<p>[13&#8211;12&#8211;2019 02:12 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Siri often complains of lack of internet when I try and turn off light bulbs</p>

I saw this last night. I really like this.</p>

<p>[14&#8211;04&#8211;2019 09:04 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Nice!</p>

<p>[14&#8211;04&#8211;2019 09:04 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Flag day?</p>

<p>[14&#8211;05&#8211;2019 09:05 AM] J_#6969
Not flag day so much as if it was the Sunday before Memorial Day or something, it would remind me to not wake up early.</p>

<p>[14&#8211;06&#8211;2019 09:06 AM] BastianInuk#2009
What self centered country has a flag day?</p>

Beta 2 out now, sacrificing my iPhone now.</p>

<p>[17&#8211;17&#8211;2019 12:17 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Is it an OTA @Christopher Lawley ?</p>

<p>[17&#8211;17&#8211;2019 12:17 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
Yep!</p>

<p>[17&#8211;17&#8211;2019 12:17 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Not showing up for me yet.</p>

<p>[17&#8211;18&#8211;2019 12:18 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
The servers must be getting hit hard right now, it says it&#8217;ll take an hour to download.</p>

<p>[17&#8211;18&#8211;2019 12:18 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
I would just give it a minute, it&#8217;ll show up.</p>

<p>[17&#8211;23&#8211;2019 12:23 PM] BastianInuk#2009
hype!</p>

<p>[17&#8211;23&#8211;2019 12:23 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763

<p>[17&#8211;27&#8211;2019 12:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
not for me</p>

<p>[17&#8211;27&#8211;2019 12:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
can I like connect to your cache?</p>

<p>[17&#8211;27&#8211;2019 12:27 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Back to profiles @BastianInuk</p>

<p>[17&#8211;27&#8211;2019 12:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
maybe it goes geographically closedt to the hq?</p>

<p>[17&#8211;04&#8211;2019 01:04 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
The only thing that&#8217;s keeping me from putting it on my iPad Pro is that LumaFusion 2.0 export is broke on iOS 13/iPadOS. It&#8217;s kind of something I need.</p>

<p>[17&#8211;14&#8211;2019 02:14 PM] Verso#7005
Thanks for the b2 heads up! I think I&#8217;ve convinced Mr Kelly to volunteer his iPad Air 2 as tribute</p>

<p>[17&#8211;04&#8211;2019 03:04 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

<p>[17&#8211;07&#8211;2019 03:07 PM] koshakji#0791
Is there a way to toggle appearance? Like switch to the other based on which is currently active</p>

<p>[17&#8211;37&#8211;2019 03:37 PM] HilliTech#2480
Ah yes. This is exactly what thousands of dollars in hardware should amount to: the ability to play runescape with a mouse on an external display. üòÇ</p>

My shortcuts are fixed!</p>

<p>[17&#8211;34&#8211;2019 05:34 PM] HilliTech#2480
Yay!!</p>

<p>[17&#8211;35&#8211;2019 05:35 PM] HilliTech#2480
My only issue so far is my camera workflow is broken. The camera shows up in files, i can see the raw images, but when i try to copy them out, i get an error stating that the container app didnt respond. Big oof</p>

<p>[17&#8211;36&#8211;2019 05:36 PM] HilliTech#2480
So right now my workaround is import with the Mac mini to my USB C drive i use for my ipad.</p>

<p>[18&#8211;50&#8211;2019 01:50 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Dope!</p>

<p>[18&#8211;50&#8211;2019 01:50 AM] BastianInuk#2009
I didn&#8217;t realise I had to get the profile to get beta 2 OTA</p>

I encountered something that I can&#8217;t tell if intended behaviour, do I #FileARadar‚Ñ¢?</p>

<p>[18&#8211;11&#8211;2019 04:11 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Yes</p>

<p>[18&#8211;11&#8211;2019 04:11 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
If it‚Äôs not clear that its intended behaviour then they ought to know about it. They can always close it as intended behaviour</p>

Anyone on beta2 able to run a Shortcut on a locked phone that could not be run before without opening the phone?</p>

<p>[15&#8211;46&#8211;2019 02:46 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@leddy Do you have a specific example? I can test it</p>

<p>[15&#8211;46&#8211;2019 02:46 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I was hoping there&#8217;d be another beta today, but I&#8217;ve lost track of the cycle</p>

<p>[15&#8211;21&#8211;2019 10:21 PM] leddy#3717
@Matthew Cassinelli Spence getting the public beta I‚Äôve been playing around with some test Shortcuts on IOS 13 to see which actions can be run without opening the phone. Here is one.</p>

So you can now keep asking Siri questions in the Shortcuts app with out having to open the phone. This is very cool. There are so many ideas swirling in my head about different use cases.</p>

Pleased to see more than 8 menu items are now working in pb3, now would be good to fix the prompts on the menus, I often use a multi line text box for the prompt at present it displays only the last line. Just sending a radar now</p>

<p>[18&#8211;54&#8211;2019 04:54 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

<p>[18&#8211;55&#8211;2019 04:55 PM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
@Matthew Cassinelli just noticed it only happens with more than 7 items on the menu</p>

I wonder if there different bugs between IOS and iPad IOS now?</p>

<p>[18&#8211;47&#8211;2019 11:47 PM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Most likely but if you change the options from anything then add them back in this is how I got this to work, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bug just a set of conditions.</p>

<p>[18&#8211;49&#8211;2019 11:49 PM] leddy#3717
This is what i get when i add just one more input option.</p>

<p>[19&#8211;07&#8211;2019 12:07 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Click on the shortcut input and change it from App Store to date or text now it‚Äôs conditional</p>

<p>[19&#8211;08&#8211;2019 12:08 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
It‚Äôs not a bug just setting up!</p>

<p>[19&#8211;10&#8211;2019 12:10 AM] leddy#3717
Ha. Ok. When you say ‚Äújust setting up‚Äù what do you mean?</p>

<p>[19&#8211;13&#8211;2019 12:13 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Shortcuts are dumb till you tell them what to do like any computer setting up the correct parameters it‚Äôs frustrating getting I know but just try clicking things, that‚Äôs how you find out I came across this with something I was trying to do a month ago that‚Äôs how I found out.</p>

<p>[19&#8211;17&#8211;2019 12:17 AM] leddy#3717
Ah. I think I see what you‚Äôre saying. The thing of it is I was able to have more than one input in ‚ÄúIf‚Äù actions and still have more than 2 conditional options in IOS 12 but now can‚Äôt seem to get the same conditions in IOS 13.</p>

<p>[19&#8211;22&#8211;2019 12:22 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
iOS 13 is a game changer it‚Äôs parameter based now ios 12 was more condition based I.e if the weather is raining yes or now, now it‚Äôs more like Will it rain today if so when and where, there is more bang for your buck.</p>

<p>[19&#8211;06&#8211;2019 10:06 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I feel like this should work without you having to coerce the Shortcut Input variable</p>

<p>[19&#8211;36&#8211;2019 10:36 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Yes I agree, that image above there is another story to it, it only works with DATE AND TIME would be much more useful with time only. Already sent a radar.</p>

Does anyone else really hate the new Update UI in the App Store? It‚Äôs weird to me that they made the OS more iPad specific and changed the update dialog from full screen to tiny window</p>

<p>[20&#8211;38&#8211;2019 01:38 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
You can add to that the shortcuts menus we make are so small on iPad already radar that too crazy.</p>

In iOS 13 beta 5, Personal automation (triggers, NFC, etc.) has been removed from Shortcuts. It appears that Shortcuts-based HomeKit automations are gone too.</p>

@Christopher Lawley Ugh. Haven&#8217;t updated my iPad Pro to developer beta 5 yet, but the Mail app on the Catalina beta crashes every five minutes or so. The Mail app on my iPhone (which is on dev beta 5) throws up a &#8220;new email&#8221; screen every time I open it.</p>

Hi folks! I‚Äôm on the iOS 13 beta and am trying to figure out how to feed information to Siri without having to launch the app. I thought ‚ÄúAsk for Input‚Äù would do it, but whenever I trigger it via Siri it just kicks me into Shortcuts with a prompt to enter my input. Any way I can do this fully by voice, with device locked?</p>

<p>[12&#8211;18&#8211;2019 03:18 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Have you tried the dictation action?</p>

<p>[12&#8211;20&#8211;2019 03:20 PM] tedsvo#2044
Hm, but that still requires unlocking the device. I had thought that we could use standard ‚Äúask for input‚Äù actions which we could enter by text if we triggered the shortcut with touch, and via Siri if we triggered it via Airpods or voice. Is that not the case?</p>

<p>[12&#8211;29&#8211;2019 03:29 PM] koshakji#0791
I remeber this working in an earlier beta, I can‚Äôt get it to work with pub;ic beta 5</p>

Been having substantial issues (basically since the earliest dev betas) with mouse support on my iPad Pro. The mouse works as expected, but two things (bugs?) are quite infuriating and make mouse support with the iPad unusable. 1.) although I use a keyboard attached nearly 100% of the time (in particular, the Smart Keyboard cover, but I have the same problem with a Bluetooth connected Magic Keyboard), the software keyboard comes up every time I enter a text field. Dismissing the software keyboard makes the cursor disappear - so, in other words, I can only type using a hardware keyboard with the software keyboard taking up half the screen. Not ideal. Changing various settings in ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù does not change this. 2.) when I try to use the fast app switcher via the keyboard shortcut command-tab, the selector runs rapidly back and forth between all the selectable apps, like I‚Äôve just pulled the lever on a slot machine. Can‚Äôt stop it without pressing command-tab again (and even then it doesn‚Äôt always stop). And it‚Äôs so quick it‚Äôs impossible to time it to stop on desired app (and, frankly, I don‚Äôt think the fast app switcher was designed to be a wait-for-it-oops!-just-missed-it sort of interaction). In other words, I know it was meant to be a ‚Äúfast‚Äù app switcher, but not this fast! Plus, this occurs without any user interaction - it would continue to cycle through the apps rapidly if I simply took my hands off the keyboard.</p>

<p>[21&#8211;42&#8211;2019 04:42 PM] EconWriter#1131
So, is my first problem supposed to be how mouse support for the iPad works? And anybody experiencing the same thing with the fast app switcher as I am?</p>

<p>[24&#8211;57&#8211;2019 04:57 PM] prolost#9517
Is this a safe place to say that I think Shortcuts has mostly gotten worse in iOS 13? It feels like a lot of changes were made due to the introduction of Automations. Which has been removed. Temporarily, I‚Äôm sure, but in the meantime we‚Äôre left with one positive change to Shortcut editing ‚Äî the concept of Actions having arbitrary inputs ‚Äî that so far has brought with it plenty of strife, bugs, and more tap-intensive UX to do basic things. And then so many negatives. No more backing up Shortcuts to files. When our friends load our Shortcuts they have to scroll through the whole mess (as if that does anything) and press a terrifying red button. The Shortcuts editing experience has taken many steps back in usability, which I laboriously documented on Reddit to absolutely no result. The net is, I feel relief every time I go back to editing Shortcuts on my iOS 12 devices, and then sadness, because so much of what I love about the process is about to be taken away for a reason that has also been taken away.</p>

<p>[24&#8211;58&#8211;2019 04:58 PM] prolost#9517
Oops forgot to mention the forced search in Choose From list, which screws up my pretty menus. And the pointless tiny menus on iPad that once filled the screen.</p>

<p>[24&#8211;59&#8211;2019 04:59 PM] prolost#9517
I‚Äôm just very sad about all of it. I was having such a love affair with Shortcuts.</p>

<p>[24&#8211;02&#8211;2019 05:02 PM] koshakji#0791
I think the new editor could be an improvement, if refined. It&#8217;s worse now but I can get behind the thinking if they could improve it. I also like the search field (though maybe it should be optional) but the small menus on the iPad infuriate me</p>

<p>[24&#8211;03&#8211;2019 05:03 PM] koshakji#0791
Otherwise, I agree. It&#8217;s a small stepback, but I think automations and improvements to the current editor would make it a huge step forward</p>

<p>[24&#8211;07&#8211;2019 05:07 PM] prolost#9517
If the search was optional I‚Äôd be thrilled. It‚Äôs a great feature, but the threshold is 7 items, and it should be more like double that. And still optional.</p>

<p>[24&#8211;08&#8211;2019 05:08 PM] prolost#9517
I very much hope we‚Äôre in the ‚Äúbreak a few eggs‚Äù phase of making a great omelette, but Apple usually doesn‚Äôt like to ship regressions, and these UX issues are massive regressions.</p>

<p>[26&#8211;48&#8211;2019 04:48 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

I was hoping to start filming my iOS 13 walkthrough this weekend. Now I‚Äôm not sure what I should do. Does iOS 13.1 feel buggier then 13.0 did? I may just stick to 13.0 current beta until I‚Äôm done filming everything. Better the devil you know.</p>

<p>[27&#8211;17&#8211;2019 06:17 PM] tedsvo#2044

I&#8217;ve seen suggestions (on Reddit, so not official by any stretch) that 13.1 may be available shortly after launch and that 13.0 had to be put onto the new devices already.</p>

<p>[28&#8211;00&#8211;2019 02:00 AM] BastianInuk#2009
13.0 already flashed on the new iPhones?</p>

<p>[28&#8211;01&#8211;2019 02:01 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195

Is the general consensus that 13.1 will drop when the iPhone ships? I am seriously confused, will people not get Automations until October?</p>

<p>[28&#8211;36&#8211;2019 06:36 AM] tedsvo#2044

<p>[28&#8211;36&#8211;2019 06:36 AM] koshakji#0791
Why would they call it 13.1 then? I believe 13 will launch with the iPhones and 13.1 later</p>

<p>[28&#8211;37&#8211;2019 06:37 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
That‚Äôs a good question. There are no indications that this will be an iPhone only release. I‚Äôd imagine we could see the iPhones ship with iOS 13 and upgrade to 13.1 shortly after?</p>

<p>[28&#8211;45&#8211;2019 11:45 AM] EconWriter#1131
Mouse functionality is much less buggy on 13.1 , but some big bugs still persist. Having a mouse attached seems to disable most keyboard shortcuts on my iPad Pro, and I get lots of dropped keystrokes when typing. Command-tab doesn‚Äôt work at all. For that matter, no command-key based ‚Äúkeyboard accelerators‚Äù work. Can‚Äôt navigate in Safari with the keyboard either. This occurs with both the Magic Keyboard connected via Bluetooth and the Smart Keyboard cover. Anyone else experiencing this? Or is this supposed to be how it works (i.e., iOS assumes that if you have a mouse attached that you won‚Äôt be using a keyboard to navigate - although that would not explain the dropped keystrokes)?</p>

<p>[28&#8211;06&#8211;2019 02:06 PM] tedsvo#2044
@EconWriter I have not encountered this. Every now and then the keyboard will get funky and I‚Äôll just disconnect and reconnect the mouse</p>

<p>[28&#8211;06&#8211;2019 02:06 PM] tedsvo#2044
One thing I noticed is that having both a Smart Keyboard and BT keyboard connected simultaneously is a bad idea. What kind of mouse have you been using?</p>

<p>[28&#8211;06&#8211;2019 02:06 PM] tedsvo#2044
I must say, being able to map right click to ‚Äúlong press‚Äù is absolutely <em>awesome</em></p>

<p>[28&#8211;17&#8211;2019 02:17 PM] EconWriter#1131
@tedsvo I absolutely love mouse support when it works for me. And even before iOS 13 betas, the disconnect-and-reconnect thing worked for me too - but, alas, doesn‚Äôt do the trick when a mouse is attached now. I also have tried only connecting one keyboard at a time, like you suggest, but that doesn‚Äôt solve the problem either. I have wondered if the mouse is the issue - it‚Äôs a pretty cheap Dell mouse that has one of those universal USB-A wireless receivers. I plug that into the USB-C to USB-A dongle for the iPad Pro. The wonky keyboard behavior is consistent with using a wired mouse too (again a cheap Dell one). Maybe I need to just get a better mouse. Kinda‚Äô bummed that I seem to be the only (or the few?) who hasn‚Äôt had the most joyful time with mouse support.</p>

<p>[28&#8211;19&#8211;2019 02:19 PM] EconWriter#1131
@tedsvo Long press is indeed fantastic. I‚Äôve actually noticed that I don‚Äôt need to map it to it‚Äôs own button. Simply long-pressing on the primary mouse key works for me.</p>

<p>[28&#8211;34&#8211;2019 02:34 PM] tedsvo#2044
Ah, I bet it‚Äôs the receiver. I used a Logitech one that was giving me trouble, so I switched to an MX Anywhere which is Bluetooth</p>

<p>[28&#8211;01&#8211;2019 03:01 PM] EconWriter#1131
@tedsvo I‚Äôve been eyeing the MX Anywhere. I think I now have the rationalization I need to make the purchase! Thanks!</p>

<p>[28&#8211;26&#8211;2019 03:26 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Logitech receivers are interpreted as keyboards. Even on macOS.</p>

<p>[28&#8211;27&#8211;2019 03:27 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
This seems to be the same across all receivers except my super cheap keyboard and mouse that I use for Windows. They have separate dongles thoufb.</p>

<p>[28&#8211;42&#8211;2019 03:42 PM] EconWriter#1131
@Rosemary Orchard Ah, I didn‚Äôt know that! I suspect that‚Äôs the culprit. Thanks!</p>

<p>[28&#8211;49&#8211;2019 04:49 PM] tedsvo#2044
Ah that‚Äôs interesting Rosemary</p>

Does anyone else feel that Automations are a total waste of time?
Having set one up yesterday to run at Sunrise (I.e I‚Äôm a sleep at that time) I thought it had not run, so I reset it to run at a time of day, and discovered it gives you a notification that you need to press to run it! That to me is not an Automation but a trigger, thing is the notification was on screen no longer than 8 - 10 seconds? Pointless to my mind.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sure this is down to some sort of security but I still see it as a waste of my time in setting something up to be automated that isn‚Äôt . Rant over&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>[29&#8211;49&#8211;2019 05:49 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Some of them do need the notifications, but a fair number just run - such as the ones when you open an app.</p>

<p>[29&#8211;46&#8211;2019 11:46 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@nikond3 (Control Centre) I think the name Automations just oversells it, they‚Äôre automatic triggers to run your shortcuts, either by notification or some action you take (ie Stop Alarm).</p>

<p>But you always have to perform the action</p>

<p>[29&#8211;47&#8211;2019 11:47 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, the only true automation is when Low Power Mode turns off, because that‚Äôs the only thing that happens automatically without requiring it to Ask When Run</p>

<p>[29&#8211;48&#8211;2019 11:48 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Otherwise I‚Äôm treating them as another method of making shortcuts more readily available to run when I‚Äôm ready to run them, and not really digging too deep into ‚Äúwhat could I do if this just happened on a schedule‚Äù</p>

<p>[31&#8211;01&#8211;2019 10:01 AM] nahumck#8444
So, if I&#8217;m on the 13.0 beta, should I be installing the 13.1? Better? More stable? Bugs squashed?</p>

<p>[31&#8211;29&#8211;2019 10:29 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Yes</p>

<p>[31&#8211;59&#8211;2019 10:59 AM] koshakji#0791
I‚Äôve been hearing people say you they can‚Äôt initiate split-screen using Spotlight for a while and I just noticed myself using it and it‚Äôs working for me!</p>

<p>[31&#8211;00&#8211;2019 11:00 AM] koshakji#0791
it doesn‚Äôt dismiss Spotlight search just by dragging, I have to press CMD+Space again to dismiss the Spotlight UI, while still holding on to the app icon</p>

<p>[31&#8211;01&#8211;2019 11:01 AM] koshakji#0791
I don‚Äôt remember if that‚Äôs how it worked on iOS 12 but it works now</p>

<p>[31&#8211;31&#8211;2019 02:31 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Yeah I am doing the same thing - it is worse than ios 12 but at least possible for now</p>

<p>[31&#8211;50&#8211;2019 08:50 PM] tedsvo#2044
Man. I installed tvOS beta to play with homekit automations, and this beta is buggy as hell</p>

<p>[31&#8211;51&#8211;2019 08:51 PM] tedsvo#2044
I incorrectly thought it would be stable by now</p>

<p>[02&#8211;32&#8211;2019 12:32 AM] giacomopasini#6375
Any non advanced user who is on iOS 13 and PadOS beta could tell me if the more complex iOS 12 shortcuts has needed to be rebuilt from scratch? Did you find more difficult or easier adapt to the new Shortcuts app?</p>

<p>[02&#8211;03&#8211;2019 04:03 AM] leddy#3717
It‚Äôs strange. I found after upgrading that my shortcuts on my iPhone for the most part worked just fine. But when I ran the same shortcuts on my iPad they did not work and I needed to go in and reconnect a lot of the variables. But it wasn‚Äôt too difficult a job to fix them.</p>

<p>[03&#8211;11&#8211;2019 12:11 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I think this 13.1 beta 1 had some reversions that were fixed in later 13.0 betas</p>

<p>[03&#8211;11&#8211;2019 12:11 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Hoping there&#8217;s a new beta today?</p>

<p>[03&#8211;31&#8211;2019 12:31 PM] Zulfi#4524
Any developers here working on new shortcuts with custom parameters for iOS13? Running into a lot of issues, with custom dialog prompts not working (when they worked fine before).</p>

<p>[03&#8211;50&#8211;2019 02:50 PM] leddy#3717
It will be interesting to see if the 13.1 betas come out once a week or every two weeks.</p>

<p>[03&#8211;13&#8211;2019 03:13 PM] Conor O&#8217;Hollaren#6254
is anyone else seeing a long delay / spotty response detecting NFC stickers and firing a shortcut? (ios 13.1b1, iphone XS)</p>

<p>[04&#8211;19&#8211;2019 09:19 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
In general the Automations are a bit slow in this beta</p>

Is there some existing device with lots of buttons that would map to the pointing devices accessibility feature?</p>

I ordered a couple different gaming mouse&#8217;s and they don&#8217;t work. All the keys on the side need to be programed and iPadOS doesn&#8217;t recognize them. Logitech did announce a new MX Master mouse today that I&#8217;m pretty excited about.</p>

Maybe I wasn‚Äôt meant for betas. Was FaceTimeing a friend and wanted to use Animoji. Then my screen froze. Tried to reboot but instead called 911 emergency. I couldn‚Äôt hang up! I kept telling the operator that it was just a glitch. But she kept asking me what‚Äôs wrong. Then she sent the police! Then I guess because I couldn‚Äôt do anything with my phone it automatically called my emergency contact which was my my brother! And because my phone was totally frozen, I couldn‚Äôt do a reboot or a hard boot, he couldn‚Äôt get through so he had to come to my place too! This is going to be some feedback!</p>

Could the operator hear you?</p>

<p>[11&#8211;22&#8211;2019 01:22 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
It&#8217;s (fairly) standard protocol to assume if they receive a silent call that the person at the other end is not able to talk without endangering themselves (or that they are unable to speak due to an injury) which is why they generally send police in that situation.</p>

<p>[11&#8211;36&#8211;2019 02:36 AM] leddy#3717
Yes. I think she heard me. But I couldn‚Äôt get to the speaker and I was struggling with trying to reboot. All good now. The police and my brother had a good time as I tried to explain IOS 13.0 and 13.1 betas to them‚Ä¶ ü•¥</p>

And now on the developer page at Apple I can&#8217;t get profiles for iOS or iPadOS, I wonder if the universe is conspiring</p>

<p>[01&#8211;22&#8211;2019 05:22 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
I feel like I&#8217;m going mad. Is the most recent OS release for HomePod really 12.4?</p>

(Regular, not developer)</p>

<p>[01&#8211;23&#8211;2019 05:23 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Looks like it from the release notes</p>

<p>[01&#8211;24&#8211;2019 05:24 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
But the beta profiles have been pulled from the developer site. So I can&#8217;t update it. Urgh</p>

<p>[01&#8211;31&#8211;2019 05:31 PM] EconWriter#1131

Both my iPad Pro and XS Max received iOS 13.1.2, but it‚Äôs not listed as a dev or public beta build. Yet I have a dev beta profile on both devices.</p>

I‚Äôm the same. Not wanting to go back on a beta but if it sorts the memory management issues then that‚Äôs tempting. Although they could potentially release 13.2.1 to sort those issues.</p>

What do you mean specifically?</p>

<p>[12&#8211;15&#8211;2021 03:15 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Jellycuts used to export a Jellycut, by sending a .shortcut file through an action into the shortcuts app. This would then be uploaded to icloud through the get icloud link action. This link would then be opened in the app.</p>

<p>But now that doesn&#8217;t work, they changed how the icloud link action functions, and you can no longer create a link for an unsigned shortcut. There is also no way to import a file that is unsigned or outdated.</p>

<p>So I either have to find a work-around, or I have to setup a mac server or mac VM server too run the new Shortucts CLI tool to manually sign the shortcuts. But then that requires giving everyone who uses shortcuts a contact file for the iCloud account logged into that VM.</p>

macOS Monterey Shortcuts - First look
Apple announced macOS Monterey (macOS 12) this week at WWDC, and one of its new features that caught my eye is Shortcuts. It‚Äôs already available on iOS, but it made its way to macOS. My security focused brain immediately thought about how cool this feature could be for red teamers or pentesters to persist on macOS :) So I decided to take a quick&#8230;</p>

<p>[12&#8211;13&#8211;2021 04:13 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Very interesting dive into the Shortcuts sqlite database</p>

<p>[12&#8211;13&#8211;2021 04:13 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
The reason the shortcuts can;t be convereted is because of how they are signed</p>

<p>[12&#8211;13&#8211;2021 04:13 PM] atnbueno#9460
I was just looking into that</p>

<p>[12&#8211;13&#8211;2021 04:13 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah, I was told, It will be nearly impossible to reverse the encryption</p>

<p>[12&#8211;14&#8211;2021 04:14 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
But then again, nothing&#8217;s impossible</p>

<p>[12&#8211;14&#8211;2021 04:14 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Everything is signed to your iCloud account, and from what I can tell a bit of the data is 1 way hashed</p>

<p>[12&#8211;17&#8211;2021 04:17 PM] atnbueno#9460
I wasn&#8217;t thinking about reversing it, but if it was possible to sign (notarize?) with standard tools like OpenSSL. Currently reading this:
https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/maco-notarization-security-hardening-or-security-theater/</p>

<p>[12&#8211;17&#8211;2021 04:17 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Hmm</p>

<p>[12&#8211;17&#8211;2021 04:17 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
We may be able to sign it off of the iCloud ID</p>

<p>[12&#8211;18&#8211;2021 04:18 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Cause that&#8217;s what they sign off of</p>

<p>[12&#8211;20&#8211;2021 05:20 PM] zjtech123#6743
This also means copypasting shortcuts and embedders like ActionCuts, MergeCuts, Swing Embedded, Quick Embedded etc etc are <strong>no longer possible</strong> without a helper</p>

<p>[12&#8211;21&#8211;2021 05:21 PM] zjtech123#6743
Which sucks to be honest</p>

<p>[12&#8211;37&#8211;2021 05:37 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah which is super annoying</p>

<p>[12&#8211;44&#8211;2021 06:44 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
So I have not gotten to this level, what does this mean practically? Like generated shortcuts aren‚Äôt authorized to be installed on other devices?</p>

<p>I just want to make sure I understand</p>

<p>[12&#8211;44&#8211;2021 06:44 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
If you want I can jump in a call and try to explain it better than I can in text</p>

<p>[12&#8211;45&#8211;2021 06:45 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
If not i can write up a decent explanation of all of it</p>

<p>[12&#8211;45&#8211;2021 06:45 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Just let me know</p>

<p>[12&#8211;48&#8211;2021 06:48 PM] eaic#2832
basically the embedders work by modifying the shortcuts plists and on ios 12 they could import directly</p>

<p>[12&#8211;48&#8211;2021 06:48 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
If I understand this correctly, in a nutshell it means that you can no longer install a shortcut from a file, as the only way to get an iCloud link would be to have it already in the Shortcuts app. This pretty much puts an end to the viability of shortcuts that use plist modification to create new shortcuts since it‚Äôs hard to install the customized file.</p>

<p>[12&#8211;48&#8211;2021 06:48 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
On 13 and 14 we had the luxury of Get Link to File</p>

<p>[12&#8211;48&#8211;2021 06:48 PM] eaic#2832
but then in ios 13 they disabled file imports but you could still work around it with the get link to file action</p>

<p>[12&#8211;48&#8211;2021 06:48 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah that&#8217;s pretty accurate</p>

<p>[12&#8211;48&#8211;2021 06:48 PM] eaic#2832
now that&#8217;s dead and you need a mac</p>

<p>[12&#8211;49&#8211;2021 06:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I thought they mentioned .shortcut files in the Mac developer session</p>

<p>[12&#8211;49&#8211;2021 06:49 PM] eaic#2832
yep, those used to be bplists</p>

<p>[12&#8211;49&#8211;2021 06:49 PM] eaic#2832
now they are a custom format</p>

<p>[12&#8211;49&#8211;2021 06:49 PM] eaic#2832
with signatures built-in</p>

<p>[12&#8211;49&#8211;2021 06:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Ah i see</p>

<p>[12&#8211;49&#8211;2021 06:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Can you use the command line tool to sign those files you create though?</p>

<p>[12&#8211;49&#8211;2021 06:49 PM] eaic#2832
there are 2 kinds of signatures: personal signatures and icloud notarization</p>

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah, they changed what a .shortcut is. It used to be an unsinged XML plist. It is now a signed Apple Archive plist, which is keyed with your iCloud account. Meaning that they can not be decrypted outside the shortcuts app</p>

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @ActuallyZach, you just advanced to level 2!</p>

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Oh and you can generate a public icloud link with the cli</p>

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] eaic#2832
ooh</p>

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] eaic#2832

nice</p>

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yes, but idk when this is coming</p>

<p>[12&#8211;50&#8211;2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
It may be in the first version of signing, or a later version</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
So, what will become of RoutineHub? Will all shortcuts published there need to be signed with the CLI to create public links?</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Nope</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
They will be perfectly fine</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] eaic#2832
the shortcuts app still makes public links</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @eaic, you just advanced to level 1!</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] eaic#2832
just not from arbitrary plists</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah, public links are still created by the shortcuts app</p>

<p>[12&#8211;51&#8211;2021 06:51 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
I see</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
you just now have an option to restrict those icloud links to contacts</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
That is called a private shortcut</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
and can only be shared to people who have you in their contacts</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] eaic#2832
you can also share as files right</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] eaic#2832
if they are signed</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
it basically checks a hashed email that is saved in the plist against the emails in your contact book</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] eaic#2832
it&#8217;s not a plist anymore</p>

<p>[12&#8211;52&#8211;2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yes, but this is actually fairly buggy right now</p>

<p>[12&#8211;53&#8211;2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
It actually is, it&#8217;s just decently encrypted</p>

<p>[12&#8211;53&#8211;2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
So theirs no way to extract a .plist from a .shortcut anymore</p>

<p>[12&#8211;53&#8211;2021 06:53 PM] eaic#2832
it&#8217;s not encrypted</p>

<p>[12&#8211;53&#8211;2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
They told me it was in my lab</p>

<p>[12&#8211;53&#8211;2021 06:53 PM] eaic#2832
well, it&#8217;s not</p>

<p>[12&#8211;53&#8211;2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Oh interesting</p>

<p>[12&#8211;53&#8211;2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001

Maybe someone mentioned this already, but Location automations still require you to confirm when running shortcuts.</p>

<p>Focus change (on or off) do not require confirmation.</p>

<p>And Focus can change based on location automatically. Seems like a way to get location based automations by using Focus as a middle man.</p>

<p>Am I missing something</p>

Is the cli for running shortcuts in Monterey available in the first beta?</p>

But you can run shortcuts and list all of them</p>

The ‚Äúchoose any folder‚Äù option in iOS/iPadOS 15 isn‚Äôt working for me. It gives me the folder picker but then it just leaves a blank where the folder name should be, and when I run the shortcut, it just goes to the Shortcuts folder when it hits that action. Anyone else?</p>

<p>[14&#8211;42&#8211;2021 12:42 AM] scottaw#3139

I haven&#8217;t updated my iOS devices to 15 yet, but does this mean my method for processing shortcuts in LaunchCuts and MFC Deck is going to break? I send Get My Shortcuts to my iOS app and decode the XML Plist to process and import the data.</p>

I think it should be okay, the plists are still there, but you will need to set the name of the file to .wflow for it to convert.</p>

<p>[14&#8211;31&#8211;2021 01:31 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
But it may honestly just work without any changes</p>

<p>[15&#8211;09&#8211;2021 11:09 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Honestly I think this seems like the best way to make this happen ‚Äì¬†I‚Äôve always assumed that true location automations (and Bluetooth &amp; the like) would misfire regularly and create a bad experience, and I think that‚Äôs why Apple hasn‚Äôt enabled them. Pairing this with deeper smarts for activating the Focus modes using Siri‚Äôs intelligence seems much more reliable and less likely to be error-prone ‚Äì plus, practically most location-based automations would line up with a natural context-switching, so this seems like the way to go going forward</p>

<p>[15&#8211;10&#8211;2021 11:10 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Apple could add affordances for location or Bluetooth automations to run without asking, but I think like other automations I‚Äôd end up not using it because there‚Äôd be too many edge cases like reconnecting to Bluetooth or it thinking you‚Äôve moved in/out of a location from weak signal</p>

<p>[15&#8211;11&#8211;2021 11:11 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
They should totally add ‚ÄúWhen a speaker is connected‚Äù and skip the literal Bluetooth part though</p>

Oh yeah. Has worked out pretty well so far. One thing to note that I‚Äôve come across this morning and will update the post on it but if you may have to run the automation script once manually to accept the new Allow Always prompts or else the automation doesn‚Äôt trigger or sends that notification.</p>

I&#8217;m reading people really frustrated with Shortcuts in iOS 15 beta 1. Is it true that there are problems in the editor selecting previously defined variables?</p>

<p>[18&#8211;49&#8211;2021 05:49 AM] mvan231#3698
Oh boy</p>

Possible bug: a shortcut edited in iOS 15 that includes the &#8220;Get File&#8221; action, when shared with another user in iOS 14.7, can&#8217;t be installed (the preview gets stuck in the spinning thing and, although it says it has been installed, is hasn&#8217;t).</p>

<p>[18&#8211;06&#8211;2021 07:06 AM] atnbueno#9460
It happens to me with this: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a9fb484999a8459887712aff637e4253</p>

I do not believe iOS 15 shortcuts are backwards compatible</p>

<p>[18&#8211;53&#8211;2021 07:53 AM] krafti#7925
The error message could be clearer if it‚Äôs a backwards compatibility issue</p>

<p>[18&#8211;28&#8211;2021 09:28 AM] quickfinga#4862
Yeah this is pretty nasty. I also have this problem. In many actions if you click there is no way to choose a variable, I can only write text in it. In this example I tapped on ‚ÄûObjekt‚Äú and want to select the variable from the menu above it, but I can only write text.</p>

Some are. I can confirm that I fixed the problem if my screenshot above with an iOS 14.7 Beta device. However I also tried a shortcut with get file action and indeed I can‚Äôt open it on iOS 14.7 Beta device. I get an error that the shortcut was built in a different version of shortcuts.</p>

I think it should work on everything, but might not capture what you‚Äôre doing (like they demoed with Safari) based on the app. I think apps that support hand-off will support this</p>

@Matthew Cassinelli Every minute of everyday. It‚Äôs the killer sleeping feature of this release.</p>

<p>[22&#8211;11&#8211;2021 11:11 AM] Krispy#7094
I‚Äôm waiting for the public beta, but have started preparing for quick notes by looking for apps that work best with Siri‚Äôs ‚Äúremind me about this‚Äù feature in iOS/iPadOS 14. So far I‚Äôve found out that Spark mail, Craft, and Newsbite (RSS) work very well (they create a deep link to specific emails, RSS items, or notes) so I expect they will work well with Quick Note.</p>

<p>[22&#8211;16&#8211;2021 11:16 AM] koshakji#0791
I can test those apps when I get home, I have the beta. Anything else you‚Äôd like me to try?</p>

<p>[22&#8211;24&#8211;2021 11:24 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Anyone using the macOS beta with a TouchBar-enabled Mac? I want to know what the experience is like</p>

<p>[22&#8211;28&#8211;2021 11:28 AM] Krispy#7094
Thanks very much! And that‚Äôs all, since Safari, notes, email, and RSS will be my main usecases. I am also pretty curious if the deep links that Quick Notes creates can be copied in other apps that use rich links. For instance, could I copy a deep link to a safari page from a Quick Note into a Craft note, and would that link function?</p>

<p>[22&#8211;29&#8211;2021 11:29 AM] koshakji#0791
I think they used to be not copiable when they were in Reminders, will test in Quick Notes</p>

<p>[22&#8211;18&#8211;2021 12:18 PM] atnbueno#9460

Just started testing the beta yesterday. But this also coincides with me just receiving my M1 MacBook Pro which also means that I&#8217;m using the TouchBar for the first time ever too. So, once I get my sealegs with the TouchBar, I plan to mess around with Shortcuts integration. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have opinions! (For what it&#8217;s worth, I don&#8217;t understand the supposedly-universal dislike of the TouchBar. I find it really fun and useful!)</p>

I wish there was a way to customize swipe gestures with Apple Pencil. As you all know, right now swipe up from the bottom right brings up Quick Note and swipe up from bottom left takes a screenshot. I wish I could switch these since I‚Äôm left handed having the Quick Note on the left side would be better for me. When I‚Äôm using the iPad in the Magic Keyboard, not so much of an issue clearly lol</p>

I used to do a lot of workflows with AppleScript 30 years ago and I loved it but drifted away from it so it almost feels like starting from scratch myself. I built complex workflows for newspapers using Userland Frontier before AppleScript was released in the early 90s. Workflow/Shortcuts and all of the third party additions got me back into automation and now with the coming Monterey I&#8217;m dusting off the old skills! üôÇ</p>

I&#8217;m a bit disappointed that iOS 15 didn&#8217;t bring to Shortcuts anything related to widgets üòû</p>

<p>[23&#8211;42&#8211;2021 02:42 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Fair, but putting Shortcuts widgets in stacks on my iPad home screens activated by Focus is what&#8217;s enabling me to really use them like I was trying in iOS 14, so practically they&#8217;ll be here for the first time for iPad users</p>

<p>[23&#8211;49&#8211;2021 03:49 PM] atnbueno#9460
Imagine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Showing shortcuts in the widget with the same size of an app icon and/or with custom images</li>
<li>Control what&#8217;s on top of a widget stack with a shortcut</li>
<li>Interaction between native widgets and Shortcuts (e.g. changing the photo in a Photo widget, or getting the battery of the Watch, the Pencil or the AirPods from the iPhone)</li>
</ul>

<p>[24&#8211;51&#8211;2021 12:51 PM] EconWriter#1131
So far, it seems the only way to add Shortcuts to the Touch Bar is via the &#8220;Quick Actions&#8221; button which can be added to the normal roster of controls (volume, brightness, etc). However, revealing the Shortcuts requires tapping the Quick Action button. So, as far as I can tell, the Shortcuts can&#8217;t be added directly to Touch Bar and be accessible persistently. It takes at least one extra tap to get to them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Craft</li>
<li>Newsbite</li>
<li>GoodNotes</li>
<li>OmniFocus</li>
<li>Pocket</li>
<li>Instapaper
I couldn&#8217;t test Spark though because it&#8217;s failing to verify my account for some reason.
And I tested copying the rich link, it doesn&#8217;t work. Just copies the title if that exists.</li>

Also, it returns the real IP even in <em>Privacy Mode</em> (CDN proxies). So comparing this IP with the one you can get from an external server (e.g. https://atnbueno.com/ip.php ) we can now detect <em>Privacy Mode</em> from Shortcuts üòé</p>

Thanks for going above and beyond! If those all worked, I‚Äôm guessing Spark will work, eventually, given that it works with Remind Me About This. I‚Äôm definitely a little dissapointed about the rich links though because I dont like using Apple notes as a place to organize my links, even if I‚Äôm planning on using Quick Note. I was hoping i would be able to grab those links and throw them in Craft, for example. Here‚Äôs to hoping more functionality comes in future betas. Thanks again!</p>

Here is the most basic demo of it: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e610f46625914cc2b2b526becd002f8e</p>

<p>You need to start the shortcut via Siri or Spotlight with a external Keyboard, while you have a website in Safari opened. I also tried it in some other apps, but didn‚Äòt do anything. I guess the developer has to do something in the app, to make it work.</p>

Sorry I&#8217;m being a pain about filing Feedback but we as a community have the power to affect direct change!</p>

Not a pain at all. It is actually nice to hear (from someone like you who has communicated with people inside of Apple) that our feedback can actually have that power. I&#8217;ve always assumed it was intended solely to root out beta bugs.</p>

<p>[30&#8211;08&#8211;2021 12:08 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Feedback goes right into their ticketing system and it&#8217;s tied into how every task gets done ‚Äì if it&#8217;s not in the system, they&#8217;re not working on it.</p>

<p>And especially with Shortcuts, which has a million edge cases (both in terms of bugs and features) giving direct reports to them helps a ton.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s basically like putting a problem and solution right in front of them makes it incredibly easy to actually fix it, if we don&#8217;t diagnose tihngs correctly or give thoughtful suggestions, there&#8217;s a lot more work to get it done</p>

looks like public betas have been reeased, and beta2 received do-over (according to macrumors)</p>

<strong>macOS public beta</strong> installed, open <strong>Shortcuts</strong>, run first shortcut (a two-action shortcut that gets a single-page PDF file from iCloud Drive plus a Quick View action). The first time it shows the contents of the PDF, as expected (also as seen in iOS). Successive runs <em>don&#8217;t</em> show the contents of the PDF, but a giant PDF icon. My first bug to report? Can anyone confirm?</p>

<p>[02&#8211;06&#8211;2021 01:06 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I&#8217;m seeing lots of weirdness like this where the same shortcut doesn&#8217;t behave the same twice in a row. Or like when I change an action and run the shortcut, it&#8217;ll run the old action first and then on a second try it works</p>

Anyone doing anything interesting with custom focuses? I have a custom one for driving (like Federico Viticci) to customize my Home Screen, one for meetings and one when I‚Äôm a passenger in a car</p>

<p>[02&#8211;58&#8211;2021 05:58 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Did they remove do not disturb while driving?</p>

<p>[02&#8211;38&#8211;2021 07:38 PM] mike_gdovin#5936
It‚Äôs there but for some reason the built in driving focus doesn‚Äôt let you change your Home Screen (probably because you aren‚Äôt supposed to use your phone when driving)</p>

<p>[03&#8211;41&#8211;2021 08:41 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Lol yup, that&#8217;s what I figured</p>

<p>[04&#8211;19&#8211;2021 12:19 PM] David Blue#1917
uh‚Ä¶ I feel like an idiot‚Ä¶. but what on earth do i have to do to not have to approve every single action in 15???</p>

<p>[04&#8211;20&#8211;2021 12:20 PM] David Blue#1917
always allow doesnt seem to be storing approval either so uhh..</p>

<p>[04&#8211;31&#8211;2021 12:31 PM] krafti#7925
i&#8217;ve noticed that with rdownloader. its requesting approval for all images in an imgur album, whereas previoiusly the requested only needed to be done on the first run. am assuming its just a beta thing</p>

<p>[04&#8211;01&#8211;2021 01:01 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Nothing really</p>

<p>[04&#8211;01&#8211;2021 01:01 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
I would report a feedback about it</p>

<p>[04&#8211;06&#8211;2021 01:06 PM] David Blue#1917
fuck. well it‚Äôs better to know than not. I have a personal drama regarding feedback submission‚Ä¶ spent a good while <em>very</em> thoroughly documenting the peculiar/inconsistent responses to bluetooth keyboard commands within Safari (on iPhone, notably.) I did the full log file which took me like 3 days of trying to get it to upload correctly‚Ä¶ and I even recorded a live-annotated screen recording of me reproducing it.</p>

<p>and‚Ä¶ well. shall we see if it‚Äôs gotten any sort of acknowledgement, even, since the last time I looked? lmao</p>

<p>[04&#8211;13&#8211;2021 01:13 PM] David Blue#1917
I realize whining over lack of replies to one‚Äôs bug reports is absolutely absurd - or rather, that it <em>would</em> be absolutely absurd in any case not involving the most valuable company in the history of the world.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;15&#8211;2021 01:15 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I definitely don&#8217;t get replies to any feedback, that&#8217;s not really the point of the system. I get that it sucks but they just don&#8217;t use it to communicate back</p>

<p>[04&#8211;42&#8211;2021 01:42 PM] David Blue#1917
oh I don‚Äôt care if they respond <em>to me</em>. not one bit. it‚Äôs just quite clear from what I‚Äôve learned from other developers recently that <em>addressing the issue at all</em> almost certainly hasnt happened.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;43&#8211;2021 01:43 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
It always depends on what it is. I‚Äôve seen Apple engineers get to something that‚Äôs been on their list for years but just can‚Äôt fit in with other priorities</p>

<p>[04&#8211;46&#8211;2021 01:46 PM] David Blue#1917
and again‚Ä¶ Apple just not doing stuff like marking the issue as received and understood <em>because they just don‚Äôt do that</em> cannot fly when we‚Äôre talking GDP levels of pure profit quarterly. it is embarrassing.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;47&#8211;2021 01:47 PM] David Blue#1917
also understand that‚Ä¶ sorta. still gotta yell about it.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;47&#8211;2021 01:47 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
They make those profits because they don‚Äôt spend time responding to feedback and just fix it</p>

<p>[04&#8211;48&#8211;2021 01:48 PM] David Blue#1917
EXACTLY!!!</p>

<p>[04&#8211;49&#8211;2021 01:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
My point is that the value of each engineer is astronomical, and if they used this as ticketing system and not bug reporting they‚Äôd never get anything done.</p>

<p>They are whole jobs who just sort the reports, the engineers have thousands to prioritize with real feature</p>

<p>[04&#8211;50&#8211;2021 01:50 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
And also profit comes from charging for storage so those can‚Äôt be aligned to argue why they didn‚Äôt respond to your feedback</p>

<p>[04&#8211;51&#8211;2021 01:51 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I get it man, you just can‚Äôt hold it against them</p>

<p>[04&#8211;51&#8211;2021 01:51 PM] David Blue#1917
yeah I‚Äôm sorry to bring my specific abstract business rant in here lol‚Ä¶ I fundamentally don‚Äôt understand the priorities behind proprietary software development at all.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;52&#8211;2021 01:52 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Working there taught me how much time it takes to do so little with development</p>

<p>[04&#8211;53&#8211;2021 01:53 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs always iterative, and year after year we start to get amazing features built on the history of what‚Äôs already there. And a billion bugs come along with it, Apple has massive technical debt</p>

<p>[04&#8211;53&#8211;2021 01:53 PM] David Blue#1917
but documentation is an obligation and I <em>will</em> hold that against them mostly because I suspect basically everybody there would agree‚Ä¶ yet those toys tho‚Ä¶</p>

<p>[04&#8211;53&#8211;2021 01:53 PM] David Blue#1917
thank god for apple bein slow lol</p>

<p>[04&#8211;54&#8211;2021 01:54 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I just wouldn‚Äôt assume stuff like that, that‚Äôs an ideal but not realistic at a scale they‚Äôre at. Their docs suck</p>

<p>[04&#8211;55&#8211;2021 01:55 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Apple‚Äôs system has tons of problems but it‚Äôs the one we have to work with, so I‚Äôm more focused on how to give them productive feedback and sharing it publicly and not getting hung up on one piece of it</p>

and thank god for that‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm gonna prioritize the open source stuff i beta test in terms of feedback, but I want to be more like you in that regard.</p>

<p>honestly if actual tech media hadn‚Äôt lost their jive when it comes to critically reporting on apple in a <em>useful</em> sense, i would be free to make my endless keyboard reference tables in peace.</p>

I think individuals doing that is better than publications</p>

<p>[04&#8211;01&#8211;2021 02:01 PM] David Blue#1917
considering my <strong>Persistent Siri</strong> conundrum a while back‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to think my specific library/behavior/device even must have something to do with it. which I realize is probably what I should focus on.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] David Blue#1917
honestly tho the 15 year old in me loves nothing more than bugs like that happening at random lol</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I have similar issues too, I do think occasionally resetting the device fully can help</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Which also blows</p>

<p>[04&#8211;02&#8211;2021 02:02 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
But I‚Äôd rather have it work</p>

<p>[04&#8211;05&#8211;2021 02:05 PM] David Blue#1917
yeah‚Ä¶ my perspective on my cellular is completely off considering <em>I do not leave my home.</em></p>

<p>[04&#8211;31&#8211;2021 04:31 PM] EconWriter#1131
Thanks for filing that feedback in such a detailed fashion. I&#8217;ve had the same problems with Safari in iOS, but was resigned to just living with it since I realize I&#8217;m an edge case who uses my iPhone in a very unique way (and I know you&#8217;re on that tail of the distribution with me). So thanks for putting the work in!</p>

<p>[04&#8211;40&#8211;2021 07:40 PM] David Blue#1917
that is basically my life purpose at this point so thank <em>you</em>. I have been thinking about the best way to bring together ‚Äúpeople like us.‚Äù not like‚Ä¶ in the annual convention sense (though that would make for one absolutely perplexing image for those who still don‚Äôt know/haven‚Äôt considered hehe.</p>

<p>a website, maybe? or maybe just a subreddit.</p>

<p>[04&#8211;42&#8211;2021 07:42 PM] David Blue#1917
not appropriate to continue on that here, but - if you haven‚Äôt tried out iOS 15 yet‚Ä¶ i have bad news, I‚Äôm afraid. they seem to have broken calling spotlight with ‚Äò ‚åò + Spacebar ‚Äô again‚Ä¶</p>

<p>[04&#8211;42&#8211;2021 07:42 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @David Blue, you just advanced to level 5!</p>

<p>[04&#8211;45&#8211;2021 07:45 PM] David Blue#1917
it always calls but doesn‚Äôt always deliver selection (cursor) back to the text field.</p>

<p>come to think of it, <strong>I should get on reporting this right now.</strong> ..</p>

<p>[05&#8211;11&#8211;2021 03:11 AM] quickfinga#4862
I have this problem since iOS 14 dev beta 1 and reported it. Never got fixed.</p>

<p>[05&#8211;28&#8211;2021 03:28 AM] David Blue#1917
can I ask how often? and on which sort of device?</p>

<p>[05&#8211;14&#8211;2021 04:14 AM] quickfinga#4862
iPad Pro 11 2020. Hard to say how often it happens‚Ä¶often enough that I filed feedback. üòÖ</p>

<p>[05&#8211;50&#8211;2021 04:50 PM] David Blue#1917
when spotlight is working correctly, though, it is a truly incredible tool. I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I figure I‚Äôm as fast at switching-by-searching as anyone should ever endeavor to be on their cellular lol.</p>
