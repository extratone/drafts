  <h1>Transcript-Social Web Consumption Consultant</h1>

<h1>I hear me out of this one here or fucking fucking social media consultation Hah Hah Hah Hah right oh boy not for a business not to leverage buffer and Xavier integrations to scoop up as many customers for your spoke battery store now now that leveraging that leveraging those for free for the business paid for your illusion of other digital marketing no social media consultation</h1>

<h1>For people who use social media social media consultation to leverage whatever the fact it deliver leverage the various services involved the third-party clients techniques psychology reflection therapy to just make it so that you feel better about your social media&#8217;s like I could do that if you join you only if you want or if you feel like you need a change in your role in that phrase your relationship with social media I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m assuming the therapy that there are a lot of oral her probably hear that and you&#8217;re about those the people spend</h1>

<h1>Sorry sorry Dale better with those people that spend six fucking hours in bed scrolling through Facebook videos and then in the morning I just like why the fuck I did I do that and I&#8217;ve been a big part of it of course liquid with the narrative run these companies now I think is maybe actually now thinking of that the brand favorability statistics from the from the service of the box for you there&#8217;s another one basically I think we&#8217;re getting closer to being able to be critical of these companies openly basically deal I want you to know yes I&#8217;m going to make fun of you but I&#8217;m going to do so in a sense knowing that there is more than it just being your fault in the same way that</h1>

<h1>You know different yes I could say it was your decision but there&#8217;s a lot of other shit going on in your life Dale and yeah you know if a if I was newly separated from my wife of 25 years and she&#8217;s already dating or whatever obviously having fun and I&#8217;m contending with like the fact that I don&#8217;t want your friends that are associated with her anyway or associate with my job I know so I want to be sorry I thought that might be a good example I guess I just kind of realize sort of not only once but over the past year that for whatever reason I guess maybe I just spent so much spent so much time</h1>

<h1>Around and I was here from the beginning when there was no illusion about social media being like we were all just screwing around meeting people you know making stupid jokes playing stupid pranks and I was there during that time and I&#8217;ve been here and all I can say is hopefully this is the first I&#8217;m hearing this from a baby but like I never experienced any of the negative things that I hear and have heard recently more and more about other people experiencing on social media never really come across anything I don&#8217;t want to see it now there&#8217;s a big problem that of course it&#8217;s hard for me to pick</h1>

<h1>I&#8217;d rather just tell you I don&#8217;t give a fuck it&#8217;s hard for me to withhold knowledge because I feel like I have so little that out of actually is but anyway the thing is OK I&#8217;ve got the skills in my own life I know oh and haven&#8217;t been through appeared on my side in my life were like I legitimately felt uncomfortable with my dependence on that basic notification gratification OK and I went through it like her and I work through that I guess yeah fuck I&#8217;m gonna I&#8217;m gonna be self-deprecating about it I cannot help it you know know how I don&#8217;t think of 16</h1>

<h1>Girl me neither I would be recording this 1112 years later regarding a nowhere I&#8217;m like I think I&#8217;m in authority on social media I&#8217;m gonna start charging charging for consultation services but like legit though I don&#8217;t know where I would go as someone who normally like I am I am someone who I can only teach myself things which is actually more of a sounds great right that I can teach myself things no it&#8217;s definitely more of a problem Waymore than issues and it is strength but in this instance I think everyone will teach myself how to tailor my own consumption of stuff OK I should be specific when I seem like I&#8217;m going to hell</h1>

<h1>Do you get to the point where like you the accountant that are engaging with her being in that&#8217;s being serviced and that&#8217;s the interaction with on social media is what you feel what you feel like you want and or need it to be so like just keeping up with friends give me a little artist you like and I like this this is a big spectrum of users there a lot of users I know that have been on Twitter actively and you know these people to for the whole time and never fucking tweeted it or if they have sweeter it&#8217;s like to get those awesome does offers forever stuff up but they do like they do but they are like curating in someway and the fact that</h1>

<h1>I like treats they want to be I do believe by the way that people do not do these things for no reason I also like your urge to like somethings either to keep it for later which I can help you do that in a way or go to Garant Berry quickly leverage personal automation free services wife asked to just keep a third-party very nice to go back and look through some really scrapbook of other stuff that you like but funny sorry I really do I want to explain because like now maybe I can come back at the point I was trying to make it like I see so much</h1>

<h1>I see some other conferences and fucking books out the ass on how to do SCO digital marketing OK you people that do that who are you absolutely dependent upon more than any of the booth booth in the educators and people and they&#8217;re in educated in and all sides who do you need tell number you in fact in order for that to be a legitimate business at all you need users sewers and like so I guess I&#8217;ve watched that business instead of just I guess it really has made Twitter and an unfair way to the place that makes people feel icky</h1>

<h1>Well I don&#8217;t know if I could really charge for a year I think I&#8217;m gonna do this this is a bitch I would do it like I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to find a way to get people to ask me to help him and I I really I remembered it&#8217;s something that is a story that I was basically like someone told me once that literally like a big problem for free for nonprofits OK is now it&#8217;s a city basically offering something for free for whatever reason for all especially as Americans are people just don&#8217;t listen in and people don&#8217;t respond to it you will find putting a price on it even if it is it like an exhort not a huge lake</h1>

<h1>Well that indicates that&#8217;s that&#8217;s for whatever reason well at this point that is your ultimate expression of confidence in the quality of work is pretty high price on it so maybe I&#8217;ll put like a high price on it to get people to come in and then but just decide not to charge them really all I want to try your new penny we have a PayPal link that&#8217;s a fake so I connect the brown anyway I just wanna help you one more thing like yours does that you&#8217;ll be doing me a favor and take me up on us because I think about it I&#8217;m looking at my phone in life as it is an old 28-year-old man and the thing that I really seem to know like having authority a grasp on more than most people is social media which is</h1>

<p>Regardless of how it is in my life pretty much universal and distracted in the main stream and the desserts stay lit folks</p>
