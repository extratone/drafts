  <h1>David Blue speaks to Twitter Employees for the First Time - Transcript</h1>

<p>Awesome David blue</p>

<h1>this is a big moment for me so I&#8217;m gonna preface it real quick in that after like 10 years of unrequited feedback and request I&#8217;m glad to talk to you guys put on voice him so I&#8217;m gonna focus on her question why did I subscribe well it would be silly of me not to having spent my entire adult life publicly requesting that you guys implement a subscription service honestly for any of you the advantages that that it has for users oh yeah I want to say a big piece feedback via Twitter for iOS app has since I subscribed to Twitter blue</h1>

<h1>Contentious by the way I&#8217;m just a big Aji but like I want you to know that I&#8217;m in I&#8217;m in here because I&#8217;m invested in Twitter sale via Twitter that iOS app has not randomly logged me out not once in the past seven days that I can subscribe so I do appreciate that I love I love the investment in list that you guys are showing it&#8217;s like been my pet thing for 12 Michael 12 years of of being a Twitter user and it represents a real investment in a giving people the power to hear it for themselves via I am real I&#8217;m really happy about that I used to have a reminder that a weekly reminder to check the Trello</h1>

<h1>Card in your guys ' road map for Twitter list that&#8217;s that&#8217;s how invested I am with the feature and I I want you to stop me when you just we just what do you want are you OK is it is it more than you want to say one more note suggestion and ability to queue posts and I guess in tandem look into ways that other services have implemented delete and re-draft I think the at the undo tweet I understand the sentiment and I understand the ridiculous pressure of the earth do you face that I also understand that fundamentally editing the weather Twitter was designed from the beginning it makes no sense but even better sweet that is what is a plug-in that has a sweet deck implements delete and redo</h1>

<h1>Raft which is exactly what it says I think in tan him that would be very powerful also can if you maybe could lift follow limits for people that pay I met up with the following one on Twitter since 2017 David curious great what were the delete and re-draft give you that you&#8217;re currently not getting with the undo button I know you touched on this a little bit but I&#8217;d love to hear more about that it&#8217;s difficult to describe without if you&#8217;ve never used to delete and re-draft simply what it does is well companies Macedon is example because it&#8217;s its native there in Macedon&#8217;s in toot sweet as web client you push one button about where is it is in a 33.menu on an individual post and then you push deleting</h1>

<h1>Drafted an instantly without confirmation delete that post and then moves the content of that post back into the composed window so I think it is in a L I want to be a lot of butter for the undo it is legitimately a psychologically intelligent way of accomplishing I think it&#8217;s very smart I am of actually very impressed I should say after having I&#8217;ve been really really critical of Twitter this year specifically for adjacent reasons so God please don&#8217;t please don&#8217;t feel like emotionally responsible for anything on my timeline and thank you thank you for listening to me it&#8217;s OK David we appreciate all the feedback this is why we have this open form for you and you&#8217;re always welcome to share constructive criticism for us at you as you can</h1>

<p>What is over the past year so we are sharing a lot more and very transparent how we&#8217;re building so we would appreciate all the feedback all right you&#8217;re trying yeah but oh yeah transfers pushing it but yet or what I can fair enough thank you so much for sharing all right we&#8217;ve got Dora Dora no</p>
