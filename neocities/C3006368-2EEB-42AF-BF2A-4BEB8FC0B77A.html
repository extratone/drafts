<p>Hi, David.</p>

<p>My real name is Lee Hauser, and I live and work in the Seattle, WA area, helping a large logistics company keep everyone supplied with clothing, tires and new iPhones, among other things. I thought I&#8217;d send a message rather than email at this time because (let&#8217;s be honest) I can use Reddit from my work computer but not my personal email!
I&#8217;m in my 60s, and therefore have a little bit of time and experience with this subject. I&#8217;m a writer by nature, if not by trade, and a techophile. Since, before the pandemic, I commuted by bus close to 90 minutes each way for decades, one of my great quests has been how to make my writing as mobile as possible.</p>

<p>I started trying to bend my PalmPilot PDAs to my will in the mid-90s. PalmPilots had very little ability to connect to the outside world except to synch with a computer, but they did have an infrared port, and someone actually created a keyboard that talked IR with the Palm. There was also a simple text editor available, and an onscreen keyboard that was optimized for tapping.</p>

<p>Eventually laptops became more available (and smaller), but affording one was difficult for a long time. Finally, in 2011, I got my first Android smartphone.</p>

<p>The next year was a breakthrough for me. With a Bluetooth keyboard and my trusty Samsung Galaxy III, I started writing a novel. I honestly don&#8217;t remember what I used for a text editor, but between January and November of 2012 I wrote a 100,000 word first draft, and I estimate at least 75% of it was written on my phone during my weekday lunches.</p>

<p>To increase my portability, I wrote in Markdown, so keep my work in plain text, as portable as possible.</p>

<p>Eventually I got an iPad and went through a couple of different keyboards, then an iPhone, and settled on the Apple wireless Magic Keyboard. The only complaint I have is switching the Bluetooth connection between iPad and iPhone can be difficult.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t write much on my phone anymore, but I&#8217;m ready to&#8230;I keep work in progress synced to the phone, Textastic and other writing tools are installed, and I have a nice little stand for the phone. I&#8217;ve long regarded the phone as the most important piece of computing technology I own. It&#8217;s not always easy to use, but it&#8217;s always there, and it&#8217;s certainly adequate for many everyday uses in most circumstances. The other comment on your post was &#8220;don&#8217;t try to make a phone do what a computer can do,&#8221; but I think that&#8217;s short-sighted. It certainly can&#8217;t do everything, but I like pushing the technology to see what it can do.
I loved that Drafts 5 &#8220;review&#8221; in Macstories, too.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m enthused about your project, and I&#8217;d love to help, even though, like you, I don&#8217;t know exactly what that will entail. I love writing, and I can edit. Maybe it can be a little ebook when all is said and done.</p>

<p>If you want to text, I&#8217;m at 253&#8211;344&#8211;7509, and my email address is lee@leehauser.com.</p>

<p>Lee,
I cannot thank you enough for your message on Reddit earlier today. (It’s David Blue, here.) I can’t tell you how wonderful and deeply-validating it was to actually hear from someone my senior in experience with this… If I’d been a bit older in the 90s, I think the sight of you using an IR-blaster-powered keyboard with a Palm Pilot on the bus to work would have absolutely necessitated I say (or scream) something hehe. It sounds like you were definitely pioneering Markdown in 2012… I could lament on how much I wish I’d discovered it earlier for far too long, but…</p>

<p>I just wanted you to know that I am thrilled that you’re enthusiastic and to know that there are others who might find value in this project. I should probably note off the bat that I have some physical/mental stuff (narcolepsy, depression - low-energy, not low mood) that can really mess with my ability to be regularly functional, in case I konk out for 20 hours through a workday or something. Luckily, I’d say any sort of timetable for this project is virtually indefinite as far as external factors go. I’m going to do my best to <em>not</em> repeat my bad habit of going hermit-mode, getting in over my head, and then failing to properly ask for help, so I’d like to spend a good while seeking out contacts.</p>

<p>For now, just know you’re at the top of my contacts list, I suppose. And thank you again! You’ve made my month, I’d say. </p>
