Of the many things I have to thank you for (that I’ve been experimenting with lately,) this is the most significant, but for reasons not entirely related to just Drafts. Without being too wordy:</p>

<p>I’ve been using a bluetooth keyboard with my iPhone since it was introduced with iPhone 4. (It began as a conscious experiment - I chose a new phone instead of a new laptop to take to my first year of college.)</p>

<p>I have accumulated a lot of evidence to suggest that number of <em>iPhone</em> users who’ve used a hardware keyboard with their phone is <em>extremely</em> tiny, but I think it’s a dynamic that’s still worth documenting properly. As you’ve probably observed, even the association of iPad and keyboard in the past few years has actually made it worse - lookup any given iOS app’s keyboard shortcuts and you’ll return a list <em>for iPad</em> and nothing else. Over the years, I’ve maintained a habit of going down the iPad list, testing each shortcut on iPhone, noting down the results in a table, and then emailing said list to the developers. (Naturally, they almost never respond. Shout out to Tapbots for being the only recent exception.)</p>

<p>Basically, I have come to the conclusion that the responsibility of writing the definitive <strong>iPhone x Bluetooth Keyboard</strong> guide/reference/documentation is my own.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m posting this response here because I want to invte past, present, and future users to please share any thoughts they have on this if they so desire, but I&#8217;d very much like to consult you privately if you can spare the time and energy.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Are there a lot of apps where the keyboard shortcuts on iPad differ from the ones on iPhone? They should function the same on either device in Drafts, and from a developer perspective I would think it would be harder to make them not work on iPhone than to just let them be the same.</p>

<p>iPhone does not have the benefit of the iPad overlay to help discovery. In Drafts you can at least enable shortcuts for actions to display in the list (in … action list options).</p>

<p>Thank you for confirming that! I&#8217;ve always suspected, but I am ultimately not a developer.</p>

<p>the answer to your question, in my experience, is <strong>yes</strong>…</p>

<p>I would go so far as to say the <em>majority</em> of the cross-platform apps which have bluetooth keyboard support have incongruities between the devices.</p>

<p>Depending on how much you know about Tweetbot 6, you might find it interesting to know that its two remaining essential shortcuts (F to favorite a Tweet and ⌘ + R to reply) are no longer supported, though there was a point where I had both Tweetbot 5 and Tweetbot 6 on my phone when those shortcuts were still working on the former. As I said, they did actually respond to me about this! First with doubt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which ones do you think you are missing, don&#8217;t think that should&#8217;ve changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then - in the interest of thoroughness - I did one more systematic run through of Tweetbot’s iPad shortcuts list just to make sure, sent the results to them, and heard back a week later: “thanks! we’ll take a look at these.”</p>

<p>I consider myself pretty competent at finding documentation on any given obscure, dated issue, but never with proprietary Apple stuff before lol.</p>

<p>I would kill for an actual look at the code involved - I’ve been seriously considering buying a used Mac Mini just so I could poke around Xcode myself.</p>
