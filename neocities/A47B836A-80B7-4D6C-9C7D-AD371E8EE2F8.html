<p>I think if one designed a “crisis-proof” version of the web, it might end up being a network of PDFs. My reasoning being:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDFs are universally understood by most people and can be read on phones, desktops, laptops, and eBook readers.</li>
<li>Once you’ve downloaded a local PDF version of the site, there is no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host.</li>
<li>File size is predictable ahead of time, which is useful if your connection is limited or slow.</li>
<li>PDFs are designed for printing (moreso than most sites) which may be useful in situations where electricity is in low supply.

<p>Except the printing part, all can be said about a standalone html file.
External content, like images, can be inlined, thus you would only have to distribute one single .html file.
I&#8217;m not sure how would file2file linking work in the realm of pdf files. With html files, it&#8217;s easy even without any web server.
Plus, html can be even digested through a terminal interface. That cannot be said about the binary nature of pdf documents.

<p>keiferski 2 days ago [–]</p>

<p>This is true, but I do think a PDF is just conceptually simpler and requires less technical knowledge. Especially in a situation where technical users are scarce.
IMO most people have a mental model of a PDF as being a digital document, whereas a HTML file is somewhat more amorphous.

<p>Pandoc is a converter, not a viewer.
Typically one would view a PDF with a dedicated viewer (xpdf, zathura, kpdf, Okular, Evince, &#8230;), or by converting to text (pdftotext).
less can be extended with hooks (lesspipe) to read a wide range of file types on the console.
Some console file managers can also translate PDFs to text (mc, ranger).

PDFs need a proprietary app to use, most of which are loaded with spyware &amp; trackers. I may be mistaken in this but MacOS/iOS are the only OSes I know of that read them natively? There&#8217;s absolutely nothing universal about the format.
HTML is truly universal: not only does every OS come with a built in HTML viewer, but it&#8217;s a plain text file. You can read the source using anything.
Once you’ve downloaded a local PDF version of the site, there is no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host.
Once you&#8217;ve downloaded a local HTML version of the page there&#8217;s no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host. Yes, there&#8217;s caveats to both: people can create PDFs with remote embeds or HTML sites with ajax content but both of these are the fault/responsibility of the individual author. It&#8217;s as easy to make good downloadable HTML as downloadable PDF.
The so called &#8220;churn&#8221; is the responsibility of the individual HTML author. If you&#8217;re making bad HTML, the fix is to start making good HTML. Not to switch to a closed inaccessible format.

<p>PDF is an open format, with multiple FOSS reader implementations. You could argue that a subset of niche features can only be used in Acrobat Reader, but AR is far from the only PDF reader out there.
And the churn is part of the zeitgeist, not really a responsibility of anyone in particular. Individuals are suckered into it, companies are supplying it, and governments are allowing it. We&#8217;re all part of it. Not new either: I&#8217;m hearing it since the 90s how the modern life is rushed, and that&#8217;s just my limited experience.

<p>I said it wasn&#8217;t universal, which is somewhat different to the vague idea of being &#8220;open&#8221;, and yes, PDF is technically an &#8220;open format&#8221; depending on how you define &#8220;open&#8221;. The ISO 32000 spec. costs in the region of <sub>200</sub> USD/EUR.
What that &#8220;openness&#8221; translates into in the real world is that there are zero non-Adobe viewers that support all of PDF&#8217;s features, and even less PDF editors. The standard PDF editor costs <sub>200</sub> USD/EUR (annual subscription).
This is before we even get into the nightmarish world of PDF parsing. Or PDF accessibility.
PDF is a great format if you&#8217;re sending a document to someone for them to print immediately. It has no other valid uses imo.

It has its good sides and bad sides. People will download the PDF every month when there is a new issue, but you don&#8217;t know if they read it, how much time they spend on it, etc. You won&#8217;t appear on Google Results as you would do if you posted the articles as HTML, etc.

<p>We already have a wildly popular website where all the main content is in the form of PDFs. It’s https://arxiv.org/. PDF is what you use when your document needs to have a predictable layout.

This can include aesthetic meaning, as in some forms of poetry that need to be laid out in a particular way.

Wikipedia has a &#8220;save to PDF&#8221; link on each article (that seems to work through the browser&#8217;s capabilities, if any, not all browsers support this). The sister Mediawiki site Wikisource offers ePub downloads.

<p>I found &#8220;PDFs are files&#8221; kind of compelling. Perhaps this was a flaw of the original www concept. Web pages were always technically files &amp; documents, but this was always abstracted away from userland. &#8220;Save webpage&#8221; was never a core feature. This did disempower users.
PDFs are downloaded, saved, emailed around. They can also be linked to. Userland maintains a closer relationship with what&#8217;s going on. A typical user know that you can have a copy of a file, which may or may not be identical to the online one. WWW, from its initial version, was mysterious. The transition between the model of requesting files from a server by clicking a link to a programmatically generated stream of code executed on your browser happened below typical users perspective.

<p>Indeed, there&#8217;s a lot of irony packed into the first page:
Featured is a quote from LWN indicting the &#8220;software industry&#8221; and its &#8220;brittle dependencies&#8221;. What&#8217;s ironic about this? It&#8217;s squarely about the parts of the software industry that deal in things that are <em>not</em> meant to be painted in the browser.
If you want a solution to the (perceived) churn, it&#8217;s funnily enough right in the quote from Mark Pilgrim: &#8220;I&#8217;ve migrated to HTML 4&#8221;. HTML is almost certainly not going to end up drifting in such a way that DJB&#8217;s qhasm bibliography page[1] is ever going to break. HTML and the Web standards in general are, with extremely rare exceptions, cumulative. It&#8217;s pretty frightening how many technical people don&#8217;t understand this; the Web is intentionally engineered to serve as &#8220;the infrastructure for handling humanity&#8217;s publishing needs indefinitely&#8221;[2]. More frightening is that the biggest threat to this are people like the author here who treat the Web as if it&#8217;s like any other thing that the computing industry puts out—i.e., already perennially broken. This is dangerous because it anachronistically cedes power to folks who&#8217;d try to argue at some point in the future that the things about the Web that they&#8217;d like to break (and might be in a position to break e.g. due to browser monopoly) are justified and no big deal, really.
The author goes on to call out the Web (&#8220;of rubbish&#8221;) as &#8220;user-hostile&#8221;. Shortly afterward, he or she writes that &#8220;PDF makes a stand against the churn&#8221;. More accurately, PDF makes a stand against the user, by prioritizing authors' creative whims over the reader&#8217;s needs. This happens again later in their remarks about PDFs being page-oriented: &#8220;you are fundamentally not in control of the reading experience.&#8221; The &#8220;you&#8221; here is not you, the actual reader. The control they refer to is, once again, the author&#8217;s.
You get other poor arguments—that PDFs are &#8220;offlineable&#8221; &#8220;files&#8221; that can be distributed &#8220;decentralized&#8221;, none of which are accurate criticisms against what HTML lacks—unless those Java documentation zipballs that seemingly every university student enrolled in a CS program in the early 2000s was made to download are a collective hallucination.
And it gets worse from there. Cute stunt to grab attention and all, but the arguments are fundamentally bankrupt.</p>

As long as a file format supports hyperlinks, then it&#8217;s suitable for the web.

<p>PDF is very far from an ideal format for the today world of different-sized screens. It is a horrible experience on mobile and even worse on eInk pocket books. I would rather advocate making everything available in ePub. Or even better - FB2, it is an easy to grok/implement (designed with manual authoring, simple scripted processing and low-end devices in mind) single-xml structure decoupling the content from the view even more. I often convert ePubs to FB2 (with Pandoc and Calibre) to make PocketBook render them in its native fonts (which always are better) rather than in the font specified in the ePub.
I would also mention that the text within PDFs often is not machine-readable (you copy-paste it and get text without spaces, with additional spaces or complete garbage) but I believe this is easily avoidable if you bake PDFs a proper way.
I could also suggest publishing everything in Markdown (with images embedded in a Base64 section in the bottom) but this doesn&#8217;t seem practical because browsers, book-reading apps and eInk devices don&#8217;t support nice rendering of them directly.</p>

<li>PDFs are files. We must not lose sight of the fact that files are a basic freedom.
This seems like the core belief of the article. And it&#8217;s at odds with the nature of the web.
In the beginning, the web was a network of devices transmitting files with addressable locations on the device, creating a more or less 1:1 relationship between the devices and the web - the devices WERE the web.
But this inevitably faded as information wants to be&#8230; fast and it became easier to whip small data packets around describing state, not files.
I agree with the Unixy belief - files are freedom. But trying to model the entire web on those files is fighting gravity. They&#8217;re not going anywhere. They just have to travel through the Web Soup sometimes now.
All the technologies enabling a global network of file sharing are still there, the author is just bemoaning today&#8217;s lingua franca. (json?) And perhaps there is a fear that we will lose sight of &#8220;device-based computing&#8221; / file ownership.

<p>I honestly can&#8217;t believe all the praise for HTML and web on HN in the face of this awesome critique. I hugely appreciate the love for actual files.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>• PDFs are decentralised. You may have obtained this PDF from a website, or maybe not! Self-contained static files are liberating! They stand alone and are not dependent on being hosted by any particular web server or under any particular domain. You can publish to one host or to a thousand hosts or to none, and it maintains its identity through content-addressing, not through the blessing of a distributor.
This seems to have gotten lost in the offense everyone has taken over the choice to not use &#8216;simple HTML&#8217;, despite the document&#8217;s clear reasoning that to do even that would embed the content deep in the &#8216;urban web&#8217;. All of these simple-complex propositions about making some subset language or automating document flows are missing the point entirely.

It kind of seems like you&#8217;re describing IPFS, except with worse content addressing guarantees. The vast majority of your users will never check to see if a PDF&#8217;s content actually match its content address.
All of these simple-complex propositions about making some subset language or automating document flows are missing the point entirely.
Are they? It&#8217;s really not that hard to build a self-contained HTML file, and to re-emphasize, signed PDFs and signed HTML files are about the same level of accessibility to most users. Web browsers don&#8217;t really handle either, if you want those guarantees you need to use a protocol/technology with better support right from the start.
Also to be clear, despite the author&#8217;s argument that PDFs can be self-contained, no browser guarantees that, and there&#8217;s no way for me to tell if the PDF is self contained when I click on it in Firefox unless I download it and check it myself offline or in a viewer that guarantees it won&#8217;t make network requests.
Nothing online that I&#8217;m aware of forces authors to use PDF/A, so when I download a PDF, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m getting. It&#8217;s not actually the magical, re-hostable world that the author claims.
I&#8217;m not sure that people are missing the author&#8217;s point so much as they&#8217;re saying the author is making claims about the portability of PDFs that aren&#8217;t necessarily accurate. Yes, it would be good to have better self-contained guarantees about some web-content, but I&#8217;m not sure PDFs actually supply any of those guarantees.

<p>While I appreciate the sentiment, I don&#8217;t think PDF is the way, at least in the way you&#8217;re currently doing it. PDF maybe supported by browsers, but they&#8217;re not intended for it, it&#8217;s secondary feature. Same for search engines. Same for mobile.
Most browsers have Print to PDF. If you want people to be able to download an immutable version of your content, then just have a simple static version of your page with a valid print css, better yet, leave everything default.
If you want to fight churn with PDF, just have a simple HTML website with a link to download a versioned PDF of your issue. Your website can be as simple as https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ or https://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com.

<p>There are also other lightweight alternatives. The Gopher protocol has a small, but disturbed following : http://gopher.muffinlabs.com/gopher.floodgap.com (you can actually use netcat as your gopher client). Gemini is a more modern gopher-inspired protocol https://gemini.circumlunar.space/. Personally, I&#8217;d be pleased to see a text-first approach gain adoption. I don&#8217;t think anyone looks at the thick-client model browsers have evolved into and sees an optimal solution.
I think evangelistic energy should probably be directed at complaining to organizations that share content through JS-framework monstrosities. Getting rank-and-file web-devs excited about lean websites doesn&#8217;t hurt, but clients and CTOs have real decision making power.

<p>There are good points here, but I think the author slightly undermines his message because the layout and typography of this particular PDF is so poor. Probably because it “was written in the world’s greatest web authoring tool: LibreOffice Writer”.
In other words, one advantage of PDF is that free authoring tools such as the TeX family can create typographically beautiful results that are nearly impossible to achieve with HTML, but he leaves that on the table.

<p>Why not just extremely simple, plain HTML? No frameworks, not even CSS. In fact, you could make your life even simpler by using markdown files and having the browser convert that to HTML in real time with a single JS library (there are a few, I am not promoting anything one particular), so it doesn’t even require a “back end”! Plain HTML, while not having all the “portable” attributes of PDF, is still pretty darn robust and most browsers handle printing (or conversion to PDF) quite well.

<p>Some of the listed benefits don&#8217;t apply. Notably paginated (PDF) vs. scrolled navigation, but also features such as formulae displays and specific typesetting / layout elements, in-page bookmarks, highlighting, and notes.
For shorter documents that&#8217;s not much of a problem. For anything much over <sub>chapter</sub> length (about 20 pages or 10,000 words), navigation within a single HTML page becomes painful. Well below that level on smaller devices

<p>Why does it seem like almost everyone doesn&#8217;t realize that PDFs can easily be made to support all the horrors we see in HTML? No, it&#8217;s fucking well not impossible &#8211; or even notably difficult &#8211; to jam some malicious dynamic code into a PDF. The only reason a period of widespread fear about PDF viruses hasn&#8217;t developed as it has for websites spreading malicious code is the fact that websites got much more widely adopted. PDFs have been used as malicious code vectors before, and replacing HTML with PDFs would only result in PDFs being the new common vector for the same problem, with at least the same scale and intensity.
This only seems like a solution if you don&#8217;t know what PDFs can do &#8211; and, by the way, sometimes pagination is bad, especially static (non-reflow) pagination.
EDIT:
Let&#8217;s make this clearer.
You can actually embed an entire JavaScript application in a PDF. Tell me again how PDFs somehow prevent the problem of dynamic pages on the web. All using PDFs instead of HTML pages would do is wrap the horrors of the web in forms that are generally more hostile to various viewing contexts for the less harmful use cases (e.g. static pages suddenly being harder to read in some contexts with PDFs than with HTML pages).

<li>Crud this website is so slow. Unacceptably slow. If your technology stack is spending 10 seconds just to fetch and render 13 pages of large-screen text, then either you&#8217;re doing something wrong or it&#8217;s a bad technology stack. That load time alone should kill this idea.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s no way for me to turn off images. This is the opposite of a client-respecting webpage, the only way you could make it worse is by rendering to Canvas or shipping me a PNG. My mobile browser doesn&#8217;t fetch fonts by default. You&#8217;re overriding my choice to do that.</li>
<li>Mobile? Reflow? Responsive design? Adjustable font sizes? The author kind of offhandedly says that PDFs can do reflow right now, but how many clients actually support that. Does the PDF format handle this by default?</li>
<li>Saying &#8220;you can technically make PDF accessible&#8221; is exactly the same as saying &#8220;you can technically use just a subset of HTML.&#8221; It&#8217;s the same argument. Nobody does it, PDFs are generally hostile to accessibility, and there&#8217;s no way to signal that a PDF is accessible or enforce it as a community standard.
So, the much bigger question: what&#8217;s wrong with Gemini<a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">0</a>? I&#8217;ve been critical of Gemini in the past on multiple fronts, but if you are in this space where you want to burn everything down and make your blog static, Gemini really does seem to solve every problem that the author has, except better. It&#8217;s also trivial to proxy Gemini documents or statically re-render them to HTML, which makes them accessible to people outside the community. And by default, they&#8217;re both pretty accessible to screen readers, and much more efficient than what the author is proposing.
The author argues that using static HTML wouldn&#8217;t be good enough because there&#8217;s no standard that forces you to exclude Javascript. Then they point to PDF/A, which is not a standard that is enforced by most browser PDF viewers. To me, this argument isn&#8217;t any different from telling website authors to choose not to use Javascript, what is going to force anyone to use PDF/A? Every web browser PDF reader supports Javascript. NoScript support in Firefox is better than the controls/extensions for disabling PDF scripting.
And Gemini is right there: for the most part it&#8217;s actually working today. So I just don&#8217;t get it. Why pick a technology that&#8217;s tangibly worse than the web on (and I mean this quite literally) almost every single axis and every single metric, when you could instead switch to a markup language that actually does have use-cases, that does simplify deployment and blogging in some instances, that does have a real community, that does have some real advantages over HTML, that does have some real momentum behind it, and that doesn&#8217;t disrespect my choices about what fonts/images I want to download?</li>

<p>pasc1878 1 day ago [–]</p>

<p>Definitely less freedom. On html I the reader can change the size of text or even the font and the text will reflow so you don&#8217;t need scroll horizontally to read each line. How do you do that to a pdf?

<p>That’s not what I mean (your point has merit)
If I ask a designer to design a website, he has to send it of for implementation, or is confined by html breakpoint/accessibility options.
PDF can go straight from designer to document and do everything in a program like designer, indesign and so on.
It’s a designer first paradigm.

<p>The point about the size of the W3C spec is hilarious, but I wonder how much of that hundred million plus words is actually necessary to implement the parts of the spec that people use?
Surely it would be possible to create a spec that captured the most useful subset of HTML and CSS functionality.
In any case if the spec really is that huge the W3C should be written off. Any organization that produces a spec like that is worthless.

<p>&#8220;But stable standards are incredibly important.They allow software, at least in theory, to be finished. Why is it importantthat software be finished? Because it gives us hope that we might end thechurn and fix all the bugs! I want to use software whose version number is7 1.0. I want to use software whose every line of code has been studied,analysed, optimised and punishingly tested. I want every component andsubcomponent and every interaction and every configuration to beexquisitely documented, and taught in courses, and painstakinglydeconstructed and proven sound&#8221;
Sorry, not possible. Never, ever. Software does not work like that. Bugs will never be fixed (if they could, the software in question would have become obsolete long ago). By the way, this is what you get when you try to copypaste text from this &#8220;website&#8221;.

<p>&#8220;HTML’s semantic capabilities were oversold.&#8221;
THANK YOU! HTML semantics are a trap, just enough to make you think something is there but anemic enough to be a giant excersize in bikesheading. Ask yourself this: If HTML semantics were adequate, why do we have ARIA and 90 different microformats?
Other than that, I read the article expecting to be annoyed by the PDF presentation but was pleasantly surprised by how it read just like I would want a content page to read. My only complaint is that browsers (at least Brave) do not preserve scroll position in PDFs. If the browsers fix that the author may be onto something here.

<p>Long sympathetic with the Jacob Nielsen / PDF bad camp &#8230; I&#8217;ve had some recent changes of heart. Not a full convert, but PDF is often superior to HTML, especially for longer-form and complex noninteractive content.
Books are an artefact whose design has evolved over the centuries to accommodate human-scale ergonomics: font size, paper and ink colour, words per line, lines per page, pages per volume, overall weight and dimensions. Standard-sized books are all larger than the largest current mobile phones, with diagonal measures of about 9&#8211;12 inches. There are smaller and larger books, but those are compromises either to portability (pocketbooks) or to large-format resolution and detail (&#8220;coffee table&#8221; books, atlases, and the like). Magazines tend to run even larger (about 13&quot;), broadsheet newspapers larger yet. Most criticisms of PDFs are actually criticisms of the devices and displays used to read them.
Poor resolution, incorrect aspect ratios, and small display sizes (especially mobile devices) are the key problems.
Reading PDFs on a tablet, especially a larger e-ink device, is a game-changer. I now actively avoid HTML, or at least launch it in a browser designed with e-ink in mind (EInkBro: https://github.com/plateaukao/browser). Otherwise, my large (13.3&quot;) high-DPI (200+) B&amp;W ebook reader is an excellent long-form immersive reading tool.
The key requirement of a mobile phone is that it fit in a pocket, handbag, or purse. They are too small for reading, and aren&#8217;t designed for that purpose. Current devices feature screen sizes of roughly 5&#8211;7 inches (diagonal measurement). At the lower end, that&#8217;s smaller than a 3x5 index card (6&quot;), and the largest barely the size of a 4x6 card (7&quot;).
On desktops, the first display that offered what I felt was a truly comfortable two-pages-up PDF reading experience was the 27&quot; Retina iMac. Its 5K display (itself an oddball size) suits document work well. Even not fully maximised, most books are highly readable (leaving screen space for other tasks), and at full maximisation, details really stand out especially from scans of historical editions. (Such details aren&#8217;t always relevent, but often are.)
PDF also provides capabilities HTML either cannot or does not by default (and few seem to be persuaded to offer), especially pagination, formulae, and a spatially-persistent layout (if you have a spatial memory, this is very valuable).
PDFs can though often do not include internal navigation (chapters, sections, etc.), search (if full text is included), and most critically, metadata (at a minimum, author, title, date, and publisher, see the full Dublin Core metadata specification for what should be required).
PDFs can also be published directly to device sizes (or to a set of form factors encompassing typical devices), as several others note.
Some of the issues aren&#8217;t entirely intrinsic, and my feeling is that wider use of PDFs for online content would lead to a proliferation of PDF annoyances to match present-day Web annoyances. In each case, the fundamental problem is that publishers rather than readers have final say over presentation. An alternative, of distributing raw minimum markup and formatting that to user specifications following a set number of templates &#8230; might help.
It&#8217;s ironic that the article here embodies a number of PDF annoyances:</p>

<ul>
<li>The shaded background renders quite poorly on a B&amp;W e-ink reader (though can be eliminated with a watermark-removal setting).</li>
<li>The filename provides no clues as to contents or provenance, and is likely to collide with other content.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a fan of serif fonts, not sans serif, for high-DPI reading.</li>
<li>Internal and external hyperlink support is &#8230; variable. At times utterly missing, at others, inconsistent or inconvenient.</li>
<li>PDFs are not trivially directly editable, which means both authors and readers can change errors or address issues.</li>
<li>Many PDFs lack internal structure, even where the document they encompass do. The number of books lacking PDF table-of-contents support is &#8230; large.</li>
<li>Metadata standards and practices are abysmal. See the Dublin Core standards.</li>
<li>Naming conventions similarly. &#8220;Report&#8221;, &#8220;Resume&#8221;, &#8220;Project&#8221;, or &#8220;0.pdf&#8221; are names which should never be used. Describe author, content, and date, as a minimum, if possible.

<p>Cut off your nose to spite your audience.
PDF is meant for viewing and printing books. It&#8217;s not very good for browsing and requires PDF viewers. All of the browser add-ons, functionality, and behaviors are lost by forcing people to use a PDF viewer.
HTML is meant primarily for browsing but it can also be used for print media. CSS can specify paper sizes. If someone were so worried about external media, they can host it themselves or roll their own CDN. If they were so worried about fonts, they can include them themselves.
It&#8217;s more semantic web-compatible to describe a website with RDF and have PDF, EPUB, DJVU, MOBI, TXT, PS, etc. links there and also in the webpage. This is how you provide the most accessibility. Furthermore, using a meta document language like LaTeX or something XML that can transform into other document artifact forms mechanically is the way to go.</p>

We customized Gatsby because doesn&#8217;t support this out of the box) that gets 100 score on mobile on Google page speed: https://marxcommunications.com/
