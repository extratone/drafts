@ttscoff hey Brett, I'm working on a submission to iTextEditors for @simonbs' Runestone and well... I'm trying not to suck lol. especially because our terminology has changed so much since file provider storage became an assumption. would it be disruptive if I mostly copy from his press kit? it's pretty succinct. https://github.com/extratone/Runestone/tree/main/PressKit

also, somewhat separately - since I ended up making it for myself, anyway - I thought I'd share this rough template for those of us who'd feel more comfortable preparing our submissions in markdown beforehand. just in case you think it might be useful to others. https://gist.github.com/d72d11ffc4cc1b0a0e42bf4d937dd098

It's totally cool to re-use press material. The features that are already included in the checkboxes should be cut,  and lines longer than ~60ch should be abbreviated, but I do that on my end as necessary, too.

This is a markdown-formatted adaptation of [**the submission form**](http://brettterpstra.wufoo.com/forms/ios-text-editors) for Brett Terpstra's [iTextEditors wiki](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors), created so that one can comfortably ponder their answer in their local text editor minus the anxiety of losing their progress because of a page reload or the pressure of having to complete the entirety in one sitting.
