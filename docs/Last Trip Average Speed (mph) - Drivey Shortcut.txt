finally got around to making a shortcut for @DriveyApp that calculates the average speed (in mph) of your last trip. https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10953

## Calculates the average speed of the most recent trip in Drivey, displays and logs the result.

### Requirements

- [**Drivey for iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drivey/id1590360678)

Using exclusively native actions, this shortcut calculates the average speed of your last drivey trip in miles per hour.
1. Uses the difference between the two results provided by Drivey’s `Get time stamps` action to calculate the total time elapsed in seconds. *(This doesn’t appear to make it any more accurate because Drivey seems to natively return the result in minutes as its smallest unit.)*
2. Divides the result of Drivey’s `Get last trip distance` action by said time elapsed.
3. The result (in miles per second) is multiplied by 3600 to calculate the desired output in miles per hour.
4. The output is logged via an [Append to File](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/append-to-file/) action pointed toward a directory specified by the user at installation.
