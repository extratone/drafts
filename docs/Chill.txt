Hey guys, this is definitely a *sensitive subject* for me, you might say (lol,) so - before I reply - I want to **ask for your validation right quick.** 

If you can/are willing/would like to read both my question and the â€œFramework Engineerâ€â€™s answer in their entirety and share your thoughts on whether or not it was answered/anything elseâ€¦
Iâ€™d very much appreciate it.

The answer you got seems like a non-answer. To me it feels like a typical Apple PR comment where what they really mean is *â€œno commentâ€* or *â€œwhat youâ€™re looking for doesnâ€™t existâ€*. I assume the latter is true in this case, which is unfortunate.

thanks for reading it! alrightâ€¦ thanks you to you, I have achieved **Validated Status** and am ready to begin Tearing Framework Engineer an Entirely New Digestive System.

I donâ€™t see whatâ€™s wrong with the answer they gave. They said you donâ€™t need unique iPhone considerations, what exactly do you want/expect them to do?


[20-43-2021 11:43 AM] koshakji#0791
If thereâ€™s no more documentation than the things they shared, thereâ€™s no more documentation. I donâ€™t see what they did wrong


[20-44-2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
itâ€™s not about doing things right or wrongâ€¦ I was joking about the beef lol. nobody owes *me* anythingâ€¦ Iâ€™d just like to figure out how I can get them to see itâ€™d be to *their* advantage to check again.


[20-44-2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
on this, specifically, they need to uhâ€¦ check again. there are definite differences in support between the two devices.

I would also just like to not have to write all the keyboard shortcuts tables myself, ya know? Iâ€™ve been doing it for years but thereâ€™s only so much I can do with just blind testing. I keep discovering new shortcuts that would have been really nice to know about uhâ€¦ 10 years ago.


[20-51-2021 11:51 AM] David Blue#1917
On that note, `Shift + âŒ˜ + ][` doing some real crazy shit on Safari rn if anyone wants to try it lol


[20-51-2021 01:51 PM] koshakji#0791
I guess you do you, but I feel like youâ€™re overreacting to a support person providing the answer they can provide


[20-33-2021 03:33 PM] David Blue#1917
I donâ€™t want to do anything but bring the issue to light, right? im not trying to *receive* somethingâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to encourage this person to wonder why there arenâ€™t any docsâ€¦ maybe ask their boss.


[20-34-2021 03:34 PM] David Blue#1917
now if the answer to that question is *I donâ€™t care*â€¦ **that** would be problematic.

Seems like this conversation is not shortcuts related anyway

I agree, let's keep these channels related to the topic at hand @David Blue

I also do want to emphasize that railing against support people is not the kind of thing I want to do in this community. Griping against people who don't have almost any influence on the system isn't okay, even if its framed as being in jestÂ â€“ I want to foster an environment where feedback from this community is notoriously positive and constructive
