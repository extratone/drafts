## Save a list of links from a Safari Tab Group on iOS.

This shortcut operates as a sort of replacement to the Applescript-based, mac-only "[New Draft with Safari Tabs](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/16h)" action in Drafts. It expects a rich text list of links in the clipboard, which it converts to Markdown and saves as a new Draft with the tag "tabs."
