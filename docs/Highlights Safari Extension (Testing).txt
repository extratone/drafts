Hi everyone, I just released a new build of Highlights to TestFlight.  Here are the release notes for Highlights 1.0 (14):
- iCloud syncing
- Better support for highlighting more complicated HTML
- Updated UI
- Export/Copy highlights by site
- macOS app with Safari Web Extension
- Dark app icon option
- == **New url scheme (highlightsapp://)**==
- Copy individual highlights
- Swipe to delete highlights
- Added keyboard shortcut for highlighting selection in Safari (Alt+Shift+H)
- Temporarily disable safari popup

The macOS app is still under review and may take a while, but I will release it once it is approved and you should be able to install it from TestFlight for macOS using the same link: [Testflight Link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OONmU0Z2)
