## About

This shortcut uses a `Run Shell Script` action commanding [iMessage-ruby](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imessage-ruby) on macOS to send the entirety of [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/extratone/f9df50ca0810f7ea9624037e9de1ff15) split by each occurrence of the term "BOOKS."

The command itself:

`imessage --text "Repeat Item" --contacts "Provided Input"`

I left my own phone number - +15738234380 - in the `Default Number` field of the [Ask for Input](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/ask-for-input/) action very much on purpose - I promise it'll make my day if you use me as a test subject.
