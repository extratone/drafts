This shortcut rapidly Tweets randomized strings of text until you're jailed. I recommend you leave the count at 400, just to be safe. Obviously, you'll need to specify which of your Twitter accounts you'd like to send to jail as well upon installation.

Back in my day, I had to pound out each Tweet by hand to get myself jailed. You youngsters just get to sit back and watch.

See [the iOS version of this shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11086/) and/or [my blog post about it](https://bilge.world/twitter-jail).
