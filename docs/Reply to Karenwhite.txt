> Thanks! This is exactly what i have been searching fopr. Thank god someone made a discord server where i can discuss my problems openly without having to post on this discuss page. The closest thing to this discord server i had was from discordserverlists but im so glad someone finally made a discord for writefreely.

Karen, 

I appreciate your excitement, but unfortunately I’ve more or less abandoned the Discord due to lack of activity. I was about to try a Telegram group instead. (My arguments for Telegram over Discord can be found [here](https://bilge.world/telegram) if you’re willing.) Let me know what you think.
