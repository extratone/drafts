Howdy, Town!

I’m David Blue and I’ve been describing myself as a “Software Historian” recently.

I have a blog: https://bilge.world

Notably, I have maintained/updated my TildeTown page entirely on my iPhone so if you have any questions/interest regarding using iOS to publish to the Tildeverse, please do let me know.
