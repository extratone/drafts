G̏̽͋ͩͬ͊̈́o͌ͭ͆̂̍̈́̌oͩ͒ͩd̋̃͑ ͐ͣm̌orͬͥͤͣ̊n̋ͧͩ͐i͛̉n̔̎g̏͂̔ͦ̈ Tildeverse!

I’ve been working more with [Blink Shell](https://testflight.apple.com/v1/app/1156707581) and have discovered that it basically maintains a persistent local directory of my whole Tilde site in the Files app, which is exciting! This means I can easily upload [images](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images) and [videos](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos) from [my iPhone 12 Pro Max](https://github.com/extratone/jorts) using the process outlined in [this short video tutorial](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos/uploadingimageswithblink.MP4):

### Mini Tutorial: [Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos/uploadingimageswithblink.MP4)

I decided this discovery justifies [writing a full-ish guide](https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink) on using [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248) & [Blink Shell](https://testflight.apple.com/v1/app/1156707581) to interact with the Tildeverse on iOS.

I also added a few new directories/cleaned up some files:
- Added [/images](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images)
- Added [/videos](https://tilde.town/~extratone/videos)
- Added [/manual](https://tilde.town/~extratone/manual) for... manuals
- I also added [a duplicate](https://tilde.town/~extratone/nano) of [the full online GNU-nano manual](https://nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) to my Tilde site for both our reference.
