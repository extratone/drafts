Just saw that [nano 6.1 was released](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2022-02/msg00008.html) which surely must be some interesting news for some.

I release my [TrippleTap Reminder shortcut on RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11038/). Its documentation is as follows:

This shortcut creates a reminder on a list set at install at a time in the future specified at install including a timestamp in [DavodTime](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/DavodTime), a URL captured from the clipboard, and the last image saved. I have it set to be triggered on the Triple tap [Back Tap](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211781) setting.

### Steps
1. An [Ask For Input](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/ask-for-input/) action prompts for the reminder title.
2. A duration of your choosing is added to the current time with an [Adjust Date](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/adjust-date/) action.
3. A [Get Latest Photos](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/get-latest-photos) action gets the latest photo saved.
4. A URL - if any - is grabbed from the clipboard.
5. A reminder is created using an [Add New Reminder](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/add-new-reminder) action with the details gathered above.
