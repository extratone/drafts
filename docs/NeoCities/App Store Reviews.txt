# App Store Reviews

![iTunes Music](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/itunes.png)

I made a commitment to spending as much or more time writing actual App Store reviews for applications I was otherwise writing about than... otherwise writing about them. That was a while ago and I have *not* been holding myself to that. Regardless - given how terribly Appleâ€™s App Store reviewing system has been maintained, times the consequences App Store reviews still have on downloads/sales for developers, I figured having a place to store them would be a good idea.
