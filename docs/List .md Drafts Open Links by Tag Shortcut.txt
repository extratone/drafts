## Create a draft with a list of drafts in a tag with their open URLs as Markdown links.

![List md Drafts Open Links by Tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153803446-06f77546-299c-491f-8347-fb3bb6a6d6dd.png)

This shortcut creates a new draft with a (-) list of drafts from a single tag search, hyperlinked with their respective [Drafts Open URLs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates#identifier-tags). By default, the new draft is titled in this format: `[tag] - [DavodTimeâ„¢]`. Upon installation, you will be asked to specify a maximum number of drafts to return in the search (optional,) as well as any tags you'd like to apply to the new draft (also optional.)

Upon running the shortcut, you'll need to specify a single tag to search in an [Ask For Input](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/ask-for-input) action. 

Here's [an example result](http://simp.ly/publish/SdVLR3) of the shortcut.

For whatever reason, I've found this shortcut runs bizarrely fast... *Too* fast, almost.
