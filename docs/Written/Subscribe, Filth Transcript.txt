Good morning can you hear me I really am in Syria now I'm not on special audio though but if you'd like that you can request it because you're hearing me from well in my what are my life has been the most versatile the single most versatile piece of equipment I have ever owned the zoom each to it that's a little sick one it's not the 86 and it's just five microphones that are infinitely configurable anyway designs like 15 years old but like it was one of the things that I lost in Portland along with all my equipment so I was like mom will you please buy me a need to and for Christmas so that I can talk to myself more and somehow in the in term between when I bought my other one I don't know what that I use that thing and beat it up and cats are my car all the time for zoom was compelled to install special audio sport I think my special audio sample syllabus I actually want to talk about the subscribe button and summer

And you have never had any investment as in like I never had any success on any of the creator academy services that were at work that are in the subject but like I definitely don't now so from my remove respective Brandon came up is that the guy that just does it feel like the most videos on iOS specifically on news to be honest that you will never listen to this so I kind of despise him because his thing is all OK if there's a new developer beta he'll release video as soon as possible but the problem is because I didn't realize that Apple doesn't actually just say what they changed it's literally whatever all I just tested it I don't even know I don't think you can call or you can call beta test for his beneficiaries if they're not informed whatsoever between a license but anyway he's like just makes the video and doesn't like it takes time for the allergies but you know what what prompted this so I subscribed

To this day Brandon even though like I want to subscribe to me like I even have the Bella partially because like I don't know for whatever reason I wanted to be notified fairly soon want a better becomes available even though it makes no difference in my life or anyone else's but like frankly I find that experience pretty unpleasant even though I think what he's doing is it a cesarean stuff a breakout of a deal like I was labors grade I just wish there wasn't so happy to do it but anyway so he's nervous video he was like more insistent that I was like I see you guys coming back every video but you're not subscribed I see a huge number of viewers coming back every video that I subscribed you need to subscribe and like you know maybe it's because I haven't been a mess in YouTube in so long but the reason why I became an investor than YouTube as viewers because I basically stopped being able to like watch like

I want you to Lily was your suspicion page forgive me that was linear and like you push the subscribe button and then it would appear in a chronological feed I mean it wasn't reliable because it but like now when I go on YouTube I mean there's stuff recommended to make sure but like I just I'm not in control of the experience anymore in any sense like if I wanted to watch YouTube I would be relying upon some third-party means of tracking the channels when they really because like anyway what I'm saying is why the fuck wouldn't you hit that button I mean frankly like I guess and you know maybe it's my fingers yeah I had the following and I'm clear because I hit the follow button on the lake do you have any idea how short life is like I don't know I get it if you want thing if one thing my point sorry if like being discriminate about who is subscribed to you would actually result in like a coherent

Stream of contacting him but I know it doesn't anymore so like I mean Hannah just tell me if these people back it's like it I've already rented about the same thing but like when switching rooms feel the need to thank me for pushing the heart when it literally at the subscribing not paying anything just be like yes your channels on my feed now and then like thanks man I was just like please/what the fuck thank me when I give you money like I don't know but like again this is a aspect of life where I seem to be in the minority but like I don't know none of it's real none of it makes any sense none of it's like economically rational hence the immense amount of revenue that was well that's good I'll just go for it that was like Mercedes-Benz paying lump sum's of revenue basically to google he was at service to serve videos

Toddlers watching like toy videos over and over and over again I don't member what that was like 2015 and 20 just do the simple ask I don't know I don't know I just I'm sitting and I'm watching so I clicked on a video there's nothing that this person could say that would make me feel like oh my god you're asking too much I don't know where it really fucking where are really privileged position our way that we can be stingy about "I got our feeds but yeah don't follow me on Twitter because they value back
