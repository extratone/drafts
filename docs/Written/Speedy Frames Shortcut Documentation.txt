I’ve done it folks… I do believe I have devised the speediest means of rendering single-capture iPhone mockups.

I took Federico Viticci’s [Apple Frames 2.0](https://www.macstories.net/ios/apple-frames-2-0-faster-lighter-and-featuring-support-for-iphone-13-ipad-mini-ipad-10-2-imac-24-macbook-air-and-multiple-languages/) and made the following modifications:

1. I deleted all of the annotations in `Comment` form. They’re a testament to Federico’s diligence and huge contribution to personal automation with iOS… but they’re also just extra text.
2. I replaced the `Find Photos Where` action with `Get Latest Photos` with the `Include Screenshots` toggle ON and the retrieval limit set to just one. 
3. I deleted the entire export preferences menu and replaced it with actions that save the result both to a specific Photos album for frames and a corresponding iCloud Drive folder.

The resulting shortcut takes around 5-7 seconds to produce a single mocked up frame on my iPhone 12 Pro Max running iOS 15.3 beta after it’s triggered, and I think most of that is spent displaying the requisite notifications. 

See my post coming soon to https://bilge.world if you’d like to know how I rigged it up with Back Tap :)

``` 
hey y’all I had to share this with you… by far the quickest setup for creating iPhone screen mockups *I’ve* ever come up with, certainly. 

@viticci’s Apple Frames 2 Shortcuts but set to grab the last screenshot (no selection,) and triggered by a double Back Tap.

I’ll be documenting and sharing shortly! if you need more details, this Issue is where they’ll be coming first. https://github.com/extratone/i/issues/117

## About
I figured I may as well share my personal Drafts web page capture Shortcut, which reliably returns Markdown-formatted Drafts headed by a given web page’s featured image (if present,) byline, and timestamp, followed by a correctly-hyperlinked source URL between quotation marks.
