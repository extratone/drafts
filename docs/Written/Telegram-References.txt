> A single boost costs $4.99 a month, and any member of the Discord Server can contribute. If you’re a Discord Nitro subscriber, you get a 30% discount on all Discord Server Boost purchases. Recently, Discord introduced lower thresholds for upgrading Discord Server Levels. Before, it takes 15 server boosts to achieve Level 2, and 30 server boosts to reach Level 3. But in a recent update, it will now only take 7 server boosts to reach Level 2, and 14 boosts to reach Level 3. That’d be a total of $34.93 for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro subscribers.
