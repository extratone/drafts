					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] What I love about this keyboard is that while it adds some heft to the device, it is still ultra-portable, and contains my entire work station in an all-in-one setup. In most cases, this is the only thing that I need to bring around with me. I can do some of my work, write to my heart&#8217;s content, and get anything and everything done with efficiency. The keys are backlit, which is a nice touch over the keyboard that I previously had. It&#8217;s the perfect compliment to the Apple Pencil, with the built in pencil loop. And the best part of all: it&#8217;s attached to my iPad Pro. FINALLY. [&#8230;]]]></description>
