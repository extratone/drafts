					<description><![CDATA[Great article, Tim! Love the font on the site ;)  One thing that I think might require clarification is that you state you just need to 3d Touch the Drafts icon (damn, I want to upgrade my phone now) and then in the next sentence state that you don&#039;t even need to think about where on the Home screen the Drafts icon is. How does one 3d press an icon without having to think about where the icon is? Were you talking about using Notification Centre rather than Home screen?  Thankyou! ]]></description>
