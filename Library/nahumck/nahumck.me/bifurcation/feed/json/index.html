It certainly is a very powerful todo manager, but my problem in changing tools is having used Things for a number of years, i expect any other todo manager to work in the same way as i have become accustomed to. Just wish CulturedCode were more open with their customers on Things 3 features and timelines. The closure of the forums on cultured code was another event that lead me to think that they are not that interested in their customers.\r\n\r\nFor my work todo's i have been using TickTIck, but have just yesterday moved to Tidiest as i have had a couple of gripes with TIckTIck, and i am also a todo app addict...\r\n\r\nI also have a third set of todo's in iOS reminders for family tasks that i share with my wife....Oh for one app to rule them all! Simple enough to share tasks with my wife, cross platform access to have my work tasks, and powerful enough to tailor to my own method of working.",
