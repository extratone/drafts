										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, my buddy Seth walked me through a bit of his <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&#038;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> setup. He&#8217;s been creating a lot more workspaces as of late, but didn&#8217;t think the workspace switching actions I had created before were enough, and he wanted a better way to cycle through them.</p>
<p>My coding skills aren&#8217;t that great, and quite frankly, are rusty as hell because I haven&#8217;t really done a lot of it due to other commitments. At the time, I was preparing for some big reviews at work, so I didn&#8217;t even have time to look into it. Seth then reached out to the <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">Drafts Community</a>. It did take long before Jacob (jsamlarose) <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/equivalent-to-cmd-tab-for-switching-workspaces/11294">answered the call</a> and <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1rE">created the action</a> Seth requested. (Great work, Jacob!)</p>
<p>After discussing this over the phone with Seth, he was elated at his new method of switching. But he also wanted to cycle this in reverse as well. A quick search later, I found the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reverse.asp"><code>.reverse()</code> javascript function</a>, and simply added the line under the first line of the script. This reverses the array created in the line above, and then the rest of the script works in the same way. I ended up renaming the actions to <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1rF">Cycle Workspace FWD</a> and <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1rG">Cycle Workspace REV</a> and changing the icons used, along with changing the keyboard actions to <code>⌘→</code> and <code>⌘←</code> respectively.</p>
<p>This is just something simple that&#8217;s really great and really effective. I think too often we can complicated the automation of different things and set our sights on creating complex actions (or shortcuts) to make our lives better. I&#8217;m finding that more and more, the simplest actions tend to be the right ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though Seth and I <a href="https://nahumck.me/fully-broken/">no longer have a podcast</a>, we still talk nearly daily about a lot of things. One of them is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&#038;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a>, and how we are using it for small life improvements here and there. Journaling is one of them, and it has become a part of standard practice for me. I don&#8217;t always have to put something in that&#8217;s poignant, but I do document quite a bit from time to time. I&#8217;m not perfect at it, but I try to do the best that I can. After all, it&#8217;s for me – so if I don&#8217;t do well at it, I&#8217;m only disappointing myself…</p>
<p>I journal using Drafts because I trust the system. Using Shortcuts, I run an automation in the morning to create the entry at 4:00am so I never miss a day; this entry is created in a specific format with the <code>journal</code> tag, date heading in <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code> format, and some weather and date information. I have another automation that runs just before midnight to save it as a nice-looking PDF at night and archive the draft. I still keep all the journal entries in Drafts: they live in my Journal workspace in the archive folder at the top of the drafts list. I keep them just in case I need to search for something later, even though I hardly do it. But there are times where I might want to go back and review them just to see what happened in the past. One of Seth&#8217;s problems was that he wanted a way to review things that happened on that day throughout the life of his digital journal. We used to use Shortcuts to do this, but that&#8217;s cumbersome at best. Why use another app when Drafts is perfectly suited for this? Seth ended up finding <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-use-temporary-workspaces-to-filter-the-draft-list/3030">this forum tip</a> on creating temporary workspaces, which admittedly was from a while ago (November <em>2018</em>). Even though a lot of you think I&#8217;m an expert, there&#8217;s quite a bit of this stuff that I don&#8217;t know or use.</p>
<p>Using this example, I was able to create an action to show what happened <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1qP">On This Date</a>. In simple terms, it searches for all drafts tagged <code>journal</code>, then searches for a string of the current date in <code>mm-dd</code> format; the action then has some code to let you filter the look of it, then load the workspace. I added a few things because I want to keep my Journal themes applied when creating this temporary workspace.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through the code a bit. First, you&#8217;ll find some configurable variables for your searching. This sets the name of the temporary workspace, the tags you want to include (or omit using <code>!tag</code>), and some strings to search.</p>
<pre><code>//BEGIN config variables
//setup tags or searches you wish to load...
let name = "On This Date";
let tagFilter = "journal"
const now = new Date()
const date = now.toString("MM-dd")
let queryString = date;
let group = ActionGroup.find("Journal");
app.loadActionGroup(group);
let lTheme = Theme.find("custom", "Journal Light");
let dTheme = Theme.find("custom", "Journal Dark");
//END config variables
</code></pre>
<p>I also added the action groups I use for journaling as well as my journaling themes as variables, since I want to make sure I use them later in the action. Now that all that is configured, we can set up the workspace:</p>
<pre><code>//create workspace
//for other options, see:
//https://reference.getdrafts.com/objects/Workspace.html
let ws = Workspace.create();
ws.name = name;
ws.tagFilter = tagFilter;
ws.queryString = queryString;
ws.setInboxSort("created", true);
ws.loadFolder = "all";
ws.showPreview = false;
ws.showTags = false;
ws.showLastAction = false;
ws.showDate = false;
ws.loadActionBarGroup = group;
ws.loadActionListGroup = group;
//ws.lightTheme = lTheme;
//ws.darkTheme = dTheme;
</code></pre>
<p>There&#8217;s a surprising amount of customization. I did find out that there was an undocumented <code>.showDate</code> customization that I could take advantage of. The only thing I would like to see added here is <code>.lightTheme</code> and <code>.darkTheme</code> so that I can set the themes directly with the temporary workspace which would eliminate the need for me to call them using the other methods; maybe those will get added in the future. The last part applies the workspace, shows the draft list, and applies my themes. I appreciated the callout in the original action, so I kept it in there: the workspace is temporary unless you use the <code>.update()</code> function, very much akin to a temporary draft to store information.</p>
<pre><code>//unless you call `ws.update()`, this ws is temporary
//load this workspace, and display draft list
app.applyWorkspace(ws);
app.showDraftList();

//set the Journal themes
app.lightTheme = lTheme;
app.darkTheme = dTheme;
</code></pre>
<p>Actions like this can seem like a lot at first, but they are fairly simple enough to manage. This action can bring a lot of awareness and possibly even some joy to your day, looking back on the things you&#8217;ve done in the past. I&#8217;ve also included this in my widgets: I&#8217;ve found that I use it more often this way, and it&#8217;s a great use of a widget action for Drafts.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have to admit, this is the first time in a while that I&#8217;ve done something like this to change some of my workflows. Not because I don&#8217;t adore Drafts, but because of how life has been going for me (all good things, thankfully). But it makes me wonder: <em>what else am I missing</em>? Seems like a great time to go exploring…</p>

<span id="more-2052"></span></p>
<p>After appearing on the <a href="https://nahumck.me/appearance-automators-episode-73/">Automators</a> podcast, I shared my module-switching action group, which included the scripts to switch themes based on workspaces. I wished that this feature get rolled into the workspace manager, and although there are a few complications with doing it this way, I think it will be better overall for users now that it has been added.</p>

<p>Within the workspace manager, choose any workspace, scroll to the bottom of the settings, and you&#8217;ll find the place where you can set both the light and dark theme you want to load when that workspace is selected. This does come with one small catch: you&#8217;ll need to do this with most of your workspaces. If you don&#8217;t do that, when you switch to a different workspace that doesn&#8217;t have one set, it will retain the set workspace. I personally have all mine set and have removed the scripts for the Module action group. You can set the Default workspace to your default themes as well.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the big news here. The big news is the new <a href="https://tools.getdrafts.com/themes/theme-builder">Drafts Theme Builder</a>, an online tool which does a fantastic job of setting all the different colors you&#8217;d want in a theme. It&#8217;s pretty easy to use, even without the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WnuyF7Rb9IQ&#038;feature=share">tutorial</a> explaining things. There are some very nice additions to it as well: you can import your own theme as a file, modify it, and either import into Drafts or export as a file. But the method that I like using is importing the theme from the Directory straight into the Theme Builder for modification using the provided link on the theme page. This means that you can take any of your favorite themes that you find on the directory, import it into the Theme Builder, modify it to create your own, and then import it to Drafts; if you like the way it looks, you can export that theme right to the Directory. I&#8217;ve done this a lot more frequently with my <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1is">own</a> <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1hn">themes</a>, and the tool has made the whole process easier.</p>

<p>This means you don&#8217;t need to use a JSON file editor to create your themes (though you will need to do that with syntaxes), and it&#8217;s a much more visual, user-friendly way of creating them. My only wish for themes in its current implementation: an interface integrated into Drafts itself. But until that happens, I&#8217;m extremely pleased with this online creation tool and the improvements made to my workflow.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for you to go forth and create your perfect theme!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get asked often for what&#8217;s on my Home Screen: what apps, what wallpaper, what layout. Now with iOS 14, I&#8217;m asked about my widget setup as well. I&#8217;ve shared some updates through posts and social media sporadically. A lot of my current setup is visually unchanged (except the wallpaper), but I wanted to cover the <em>why</em> of the Home Screen &#8211; where apps/widgets are placed, what stacks are being used, and now I&#8217;m using them together for a more streamlined, productive setup.<br />
<span id="more-1950"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll state this now before we go further: I&#8217;m going to cover my iPhone Home Screen. The iPad inexplicably didn&#8217;t get the same treatment, so the uses of the widgets there aren&#8217;t the same. The multitasking aspects of the iPad don&#8217;t lend it to the same use case as the iPhone, which I actually like: these are ever-diverging devices, both with their set use cases. Back to the iPhone…</p>
<p>I try to keep as few Home Screens as possible. I prefer the minimalist approach rather than having multiple pages to swipe through. On iOS 13 I kept 2 Home Screens: the main page – which was usually blank – with a 3-icon dock, and a second page of folders to house my apps. With iOS 14 and introduction of the App Library, I&#8217;m back down to a single Home Screen. I like that I can swipe to get to the Today view, or swipe to get to the App Library. Everything is a quick swipe away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve retained the 3-icon dock, because that&#8217;s what looks right to me. I&#8217;ve used this time to experiment with a 4-icon dock, but it feels off. Call me neurotic, but that&#8217;s just how I see it. As I said in my <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-22-review-widgets-scribble-and-more/">Drafts review for iOS 14</a>, the use of a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> widget negates my need of the icon in my dock. So I now had to rethink how I use the dock. And with the change in iOS 14.3, which allows Home Screen shortcuts to be run without bouncing into the Shortcuts app and then to the app you wanted to be in, I decided to start putting apps at my fingertips.</p>
<p>I created two launcher-style shortcuts: these shortcuts present a menu of apps in compact UI; when one is selected, the shortcut kicks over to that app without going to Shortcuts first. I don&#8217;t know that I would have done this before the change in 14.3, if I&#8217;m being honest. The icon on the left is for media and consumption apps; the icon on the right is for social and web-related apps. I am using icons provided in the <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/echoes">echoes pack</a> on Gumroad, which I&#8217;ve found to be aesthetically pleasing and matches my <a href="https://pin.it/7HfbaWA">wallpaper</a> (which I modified) as well. I like that I can tap the icons and go to multiple apps without having to slide over to the App Library: sure it&#8217;s easy to do that, but I also avoid seeing the badges on app icons there and keeps me more focused during the day.</p>

<p>My widget layout has changed a little since the summer betas. I use 4 small widgets and one medium on the Home Screen, all with stacks and without Smart Rotate turned on. I placed the widgets in their respective locations based on use: it would never make sense to me that I put a Drafts widget all the way at the top when I access it all the time. So the order of importance always starts above the dock and works upwards. All of them have a specific function and different apps within; all of them contain one &#8220;blank&#8221; widget, which is from the app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-spaces/id1532666619?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Clear Spaces</a> – but more on why that is later. I think the best way to show you is to have the layout with the stacks and the titles of each, and then explain them.</p>

<p><strong>Calendar</strong>: this stack has the calendar to see my next events, as well as a Castro widget to quickly access my queue. This is pretty much self explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong>: I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Carrot Weather</a> as my weather app because it&#8217;s the best weather app for me. I have two different widgets: the first is forecast so that I can see the forecast for the day, and the second is a daily forecast so I can view 5 days of weather if I need to look at that quickly as well.</p>
<p><strong>Task Management</strong>: I&#8217;ve been using Reminders more and more, thanks to some deep integrations with task assignment. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it works. I&#8217;ve tried <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-manager/id1068039220?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">GoodTask</a> and even used it for a while, but until Apple provides the tools to developers to fully tie into the full feature set, I&#8217;ll be staying with Reminders. I have two Reminders widgets, one for the Today smart list and the other for my Grocery List. The remaining widget in there is for Drafts, which brings up my Work workspace where I keep my work tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong>: I&#8217;m doing my best to be better, I really am. To help me improve, I&#8217;m using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/foodnoms-food-tracker/id1479461686?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">FoodNoms</a> for food tracking, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbod-workout-fitness-plans/id1041517543?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Fitbod</a> for my workouts, monitoring my rings with Activity, and keeping my diet steady in a shared note with my girlfriend for our meal plan.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity</strong>: I have 2 different Drafts widgets and 2 Shortcuts widgets. For Drafts, the first widget is for my workspaces and a few quick actions for adding tasks/drafts or searching. The second widget is a few of the same actions, but adds a few additional actions I use from the widget. I&#8217;ve been set on these for a while, but I have some plans to change them.<sup id="fnref-1950-later"><a href="#fn-1950-later" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>With all of the widgets, they center around an idea of having a clean Home Screen. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always enjoyed. But I also like having a productive screen as well, and this method gives me the best of both worlds. In all of the widgets, Clear Spaces is at or near the center of the stack to allow for quick swiping up and down to get to a different layout. As I go through my day, I may change the app that&#8217;s there to give me a visual cue to focus. I might keep my task manager on work rather than my personal when I need to focus up on work things. I might keep FoodNoms on the screen to make sure I&#8217;m keeping track of my food intake, but I&#8217;m a quick swipe away to my meal plan so I can know what&#8217;s ahead for dinner. But as I get through different aspects of my day, I always swipe to the Clear Spaces widget in the stack to have a clear Home Screen, almost like checking off a task. When I&#8217;m done with that particular area of focus for the day, it can simply go away. And the next day, I wake up and swipe my widget back in like it&#8217;s March 294th.</p>

</div>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that there will be changes over time, but I&#8217;m really happy with my current setup. Of course, there are a few apps that are missing from widgets that I&#8217;d love. I&#8217;m getting more into photography, and I&#8217;d love to see an app like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Halide</a> develop a widget to open the camera into different modes for quicker access. I wish I could have a task management app where I could check off the tasks from the widget itself, like the old Today widgets used to be. And I wish that Apple would allow for a 4&#215;4 small widget for Shortcuts and Drafts so that I can have more combinations and possibilities. I&#8217;ll remind myself that this is just the first iteration of this, but it&#8217;s something that I still don&#8217;t understand 6 months into this OS.</p>
<p>But for now, I&#8217;m using widgets and Home Screen shortcuts to have more power when I need it. And when I don&#8217;t, I can simply swipe away widgets to create a clear space for my clear mind. I&#8217;ve been more mindful of my day, and I think this new Home Screen layout has something to do with it. It just might work for you too.</p>
