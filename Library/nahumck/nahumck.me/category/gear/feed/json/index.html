I needed something that wasn&#8217;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&#8217;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTSF94C/?tag=nahumck-20\">11&#8243; Brydge Pro keyboard</a> review unit to try out.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1622\"></span></p>\n<p>The unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&#8217;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&#8217;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&#8217;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off.

You can even charge the keyboard from your iPad Pro if you&#8217;re running out of power. Out of the box, the keyboard had about 78% power, which was great to get me started. It took about 5 days for the battery to run down to where I wanted to charge it again, likely due to the backlit keys.

It may not seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s significant. The extra weight is great for when you&#8217;re using it in your lap, however, like when you&#8217;re on a couch or as I did in a car while on a road trip; the SKF tends to be more top-heavy,<sup id=\"fnref-1622-heavy\"><a href=\"#fn-1622-heavy\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> and doesn&#8217;t feel as stable in those instances whereas the Brydge felt solid.</p>\n<p>The next thing I noticed: the keyboard is a bit narrower than the SKF.

            "content_text": "When I purchased iPad Pro 11&#8243;, I immediately bought the Smart Keyboard Folio (SKF, as I refer to it).1 At the time, this was the best \u2013\u00a0and only \u2013\u00a0keyboard option made specifically for the iPad Pro. I needed something that wasn&#8217;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&#8217;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an 11&#8243; Brydge Pro keyboard review unit to try out.\n\nThe unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&#8217;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&#8217;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&#8217;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off. When you use it in tablet mode \u2013 the mode where you can write on it with the pencil \u2013 it does prevent it from folding fully flat; you&#8217;ll have to set it off to the side to use it in that way.

I&#8217;ve been listening for years, but I never started my own. But by the time that <a href=\"https://nahumck.me/fundamentally-broken/\">Seth and I did</a>, there was an emerging idea started by Jason Snell: <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/recording-a-podcast-locally-on-ios-without-a-mac/\">recording</a> and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/\">editing</a> podcasts iOS-only. As someone who rarely ever touches a Mac for their day-to-day work, this idea has continued to gnaw at my brain. I tried my hand a couple of times at doing something differently with it, but it never panned out the way I wanted.</p>\n<p>In an effort to head down this road, I ended up switching microphones last year: I had the clutch <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2/?tag=nahumck-20\">Blue Yeti</a> microphone, but decided on the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/?tag=nahumck-20\">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a> instead. Not only was it better for the environment in which I record, but it also afforded me the possibility to record using both the USB and XLR connections, pushing me closer to the goal of iOS-only.</p>\n<p>A month or so ago, I was recording the show via the late-2012 Mac mini I have. I ended up having an issue while recording, and I lost my audio in several spots. Given that this is one of two jobs that I ever ask it to do, I was understandably upset and put off by recording in the same way going forward. The idea of going iOS-only came back to the forefront of my mind. I again turned to <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/\">Jason&#8217;s setup</a>, only to realize that this was going to cost me several hundred dollars to create. I don&#8217;t have that lying around, and I wanted to find something that would work for me.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1590\"></span></p>\n<p>I can already record iOS-only: I can use my iPhone with AirPods to make the call and use my iPad Pro to record the local audio. This is how I recorded my end when I guested on <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/automators/23\">Episode 23 of the Automators podcast</a>. I enjoyed doing this, but I also don&#8217;t have a great way of having the good audio from my mic broadcast to the other hosts. I like the idea of using the iOS devices I have to record: I&#8217;m always going to have them with me, so it just makes more sense to use them for the complete audio setup. I can use either device to record or make the call, I just need a way to get the sound of the mic to both of them. So that&#8217;s where my search started. I had most of what I needed, I just needed an XLR interface of some type. Rather than search &#8216;USB XLR interface&#8217; like I had done multiple times before, I ended up just searching for &#8216;XLR interface&#8217;.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I ended up finding something new and unique: the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LS9JI22/?tag=nahumck-20\">R\u00f8de i-XLR</a>. This device was made for reporters, plugging into an XLR microphone and allowing mobile recording of interviews; when I saw it, I thought it might work perfectly for podcasting as well. Rather than take my XLR connection through an <a href=\"https://www.sounddevices.com/product/usbpre-2/\">expensive USB interface</a> into an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DPOXS8I/?tag=nahumck-20\">XLR recorder</a> of some type or another adaptor to my iPhone, this allows me to use my XLR connection and plug it directly into the iPhone without all the extra cables and steps. There&#8217;s even an app \u2013\u00a0the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r%C3%B8de-reporter/id1066635435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">R\u00f8de Recorder</a> \u2013 which was specifically made for this microphone. The idea was intriguing, so I decided to purchase it and test it out.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1598\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1598\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1598\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/the-ios-only-podcasting-kit/ios-only-podcasting-schematic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?fit=2388%2C1668&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2388,1668\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iOS-Only Podcasting Schematic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The schematic.

Don\u2019t judge my drawing skills.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how my setup is all connected, using my iPad Pro 2018 and my iPhone Xs.<sup id=\"fnref-1590-links\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-links\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> First, I start with the power: I recommend using this Anker <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0721DV7YX/?tag=nahumck-20\">wall-charger</a>, which provides a Power Delivery USB-C port along with a USB-A quick charge. I use it all the time for travel, and it&#8217;s perfect for what I need. I use a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LNA0XCU/?tag=nahumck-20\">USB-C to USB-C</a> to power the iPad. Next, I connect the USB microphone cable to the iPad Pro using the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K6YFW7X/?tag=nahumck-20\">Satechi hub</a>;<sup id=\"fnref-1590-hub\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-hub\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> this also allows me to use the HDMI for an external monitor and the USB-C port to power everything. Then, I connect the R\u00f8de iXLR to the end of the cable which comes with the microphone, and plug that into my iPhone directly. Finally, I connect the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LPTAYI/?tag=nahumck-20\">over-the-ear headphones</a> to the the R\u00f8de iXLR and do a test recording to dial in the sound level for the environment. When I have that part set and I&#8217;m happy with the audio, I&#8217;ll connect the monitors directly to the back of the microphone so I can use them for the audio call; I can monitor the sound visually using R\u00f8de Reporter or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Ferrite</a>. I prefer using Ferrite due to the smaller file sizes and better recording controls for volume as well as the ability to bookmark the audio when topic change and/or I cough; it helps me in the edit later. However, I have noticed that using the configuration menu in R\u00f8de Reporter allows me to use a -20 dB pad for the mic, resulting in quieter background noise and an overall better sound.</p>\n<p>I did run into one small technical issue when getting this all set up: when the i-XLR is connected to the iPhone, the cellular radio creates an interference with the audio. To avoid this in the audio track, I have to turn on airplane mode,<sup id=\"fnref-1590-Seth\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-Seth\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> then turn on the WiFi and then record. It&#8217;s a simple issue, and one that I&#8217;m not too concerned about: I can still get calls or messages if something is urgent. I also don&#8217;t want to be disturbed when I&#8217;m recording so that I can give the other person (or people) my fullest attention possible, so it&#8217;s a non-issue for me.<sup id=\"fnref-1590-device\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-device\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1586\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1586\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1586\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/the-ios-only-podcasting-kit/processed-with-darkroom-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?fit=3989%2C2656&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3989,2656\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone XS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Processed With Darkroom&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1559245336&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.25&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Processed With Darkroom&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iOS-Only Studio Setup\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The iOS-only setup in my home studio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?fit=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1586\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=450%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=1200%2C799&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?w=3300&amp;ssl=1 3300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The iOS-only setup in my home studio.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For home use, I have my microphone on a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DY1F2CS/?tag=nahumck-20\">Neewer boom arm</a>,<sup id=\"fnref-1590-package\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-package\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">5</a></sup> which allows me to keep it at the appropriate level when I&#8217;m standing.

The only bit that I don&#8217;t have is the recording of the call itself, which isn&#8217;t a big deal to me as long as the people I&#8217;m recording with know what they are doing. This setup allows me to use my iOS devices which have shown to be more dependable than my Mac mini. I find my new setup option to be better for the actual running of the show: I can have my iPad Pro in split screen to handle show notes in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts</a>, Safari to do any real-time look-up, and the call in slide over on Skype; if I&#8217;m using FaceTime, I can simply just jump back to the call if I want by tapping the green indicator in the upper left of the screen.</p>\n<p>This setup works surprisingly well. The audio quality is completely fine for anyone who&#8217;s not a die-hard purist with bottomless pockets. I&#8217;ve been testing a lot with it and can&#8217;t notice a difference in what I&#8217;ve been producing in the past. I&#8217;m trying to do this for as little as possible. For someone who has an iPad and an iPhone, you can have a complete setup \u2013 for both home and travel \u2013 for around $400 all-in, including all of the chargers, cables, usb hub, interface, and microphone.<sup id=\"fnref-1590-total\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-total\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">7</a></sup> It&#8217;s even less if you already have chargers or a USB hub. You can even expand the setup over time, making it the most versatile setup out there.</p>\n<p>I think this is the best part of the mobile setup I&#8217;ve created: I don&#8217;t need to have more wires and boxes costing me hundreds of dollars more.

            "content_text": "I got into podcasting late. I&#8217;ve been listening for years, but I never started my own. But by the time that Seth and I did, there was an emerging idea started by Jason Snell: recording and editing podcasts iOS-only. As someone who rarely ever touches a Mac for their day-to-day work, this idea has continued to gnaw at my brain. I tried my hand a couple of times at doing something differently with it, but it never panned out the way I wanted.\nIn an effort to head down this road, I ended up switching microphones last year: I had the clutch Blue Yeti microphone, but decided on the Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB instead. Not only was it better for the environment in which I record, but it also afforded me the possibility to record using both the USB and XLR connections, pushing me closer to the goal of iOS-only.\nA month or so ago, I was recording the show via the late-2012 Mac mini I have. I ended up having an issue while recording, and I lost my audio in several spots. Given that this is one of two jobs that I ever ask it to do, I was understandably upset and put off by recording in the same way going forward. The idea of going iOS-only came back to the forefront of my mind. I again turned to Jason&#8217;s setup, only to realize that this was going to cost me several hundred dollars to create. I don&#8217;t have that lying around, and I wanted to find something that would work for me.\n\nI can already record iOS-only: I can use my iPhone with AirPods to make the call and use my iPad Pro to record the local audio. This is how I recorded my end when I guested on Episode 23 of the Automators podcast. I enjoyed doing this, but I also don&#8217;t have a great way of having the good audio from my mic broadcast to the other hosts. I like the idea of using the iOS devices I have to record: I&#8217;m always going to have them with me, so it just makes more sense to use them for the complete audio setup. I can use either device to record or make the call, I just need a way to get the sound of the mic to both of them. So that&#8217;s where my search started. I had most of what I needed, I just needed an XLR interface of some type. Rather than search &#8216;USB XLR interface&#8217; like I had done multiple times before, I ended up just searching for &#8216;XLR interface&#8217;.\nThat&#8217;s when I ended up finding something new and unique: the R\u00f8de i-XLR. This device was made for reporters, plugging into an XLR microphone and allowing mobile recording of interviews; when I saw it, I thought it might work perfectly for podcasting as well. Rather than take my XLR connection through an expensive USB interface into an XLR recorder of some type or another adaptor to my iPhone, this allows me to use my XLR connection and plug it directly into the iPhone without all the extra cables and steps. There&#8217;s even an app \u2013\u00a0the R\u00f8de Recorder \u2013 which was specifically made for this microphone. The idea was intriguing, so I decided to purchase it and test it out.\nThe schematic. Don\u2019t judge my drawing skills.\nHere&#8217;s how my setup is all connected, using my iPad Pro 2018 and my iPhone Xs.1 First, I start with the power: I recommend using this Anker wall-charger, which provides a Power Delivery USB-C port along with a USB-A quick charge. I use it all the time for travel, and it&#8217;s perfect for what I need. I use a USB-C to USB-C to power the iPad. Next, I connect the USB microphone cable to the iPad Pro using the Satechi hub;2 this also allows me to use the HDMI for an external monitor and the USB-C port to power everything. Then, I connect the R\u00f8de iXLR to the end of the cable which comes with the microphone, and plug that into my iPhone directly. Finally, I connect the over-the-ear headphones to the the R\u00f8de iXLR and do a test recording to dial in the sound level for the environment. When I have that part set and I&#8217;m happy with the audio, I&#8217;ll connect the monitors directly to the back of the microphone so I can use them for the audio call; I can monitor the sound visually using R\u00f8de Reporter or Ferrite. I prefer using Ferrite due to the smaller file sizes and better recording controls for volume as well as the ability to bookmark the audio when topic change and/or I cough; it helps me in the edit later. However, I have noticed that using the configuration menu in R\u00f8de Reporter allows me to use a -20 dB pad for the mic, resulting in quieter background noise and an overall better sound.\nI did run into one small technical issue when getting this all set up: when the i-XLR is connected to the iPhone, the cellular radio creates an interference with the audio. To avoid this in the audio track, I have to turn on airplane mode,3 then turn on the WiFi and then record. It&#8217;s a simple issue, and one that I&#8217;m not too concerned about: I can still get calls or messages if something is urgent. I also don&#8217;t want to be disturbed when I&#8217;m recording so that I can give the other person (or people) my fullest attention possible, so it&#8217;s a non-issue for me.4\nThe iOS-only setup in my home studio.\nFor home use, I have my microphone on a Neewer boom arm,5 which allows me to keep it at the appropriate level when I&#8217;m standing. I also have the iPad Pro in a stand and use the Magic Keyboard to type because I had it at home; you could use any wireless keyboard for this, and in the future, I might just pull the trigger on a Brydge Keyboard for my 11&#8243; iPad Pro, but I&#8217;m waiting for more reviews to come in to make the call. I may also look to improve my home setup with a mute switch, but I&#8217;m going to hold off for now.6\nThis iOS-only setup is completely portable for recording anywhere.\nWith a few more additions, not only can I have an iOS-setup at home, I can also have a completely mobile setup as well. I can start recording more often, no matter where I am: whether it&#8217;s traveling for work, going to my parents house on a short weekend trip, or taking a long-overdue vacation, I can record from wherever I am. I bought some inexpensive in-ear monitors and some duplicate cables, which complete the mobile setup. It all fits into a hard-side case made for my specific microphone, and the entire case fits in the bottom of my travel backpack, meaning I can go anywhere and record.\nEverything fits into one case for easy carrying.\n\nFrom here on out, I&#8217;m going to be recording iOS-only using this setup: my iPhone will record my local audio, and my iPad Pro will handle the call. The only bit that I don&#8217;t have is the recording of the call itself, which isn&#8217;t a big deal to me as long as the people I&#8217;m recording with know what they are doing. This setup allows me to use my iOS devices which have shown to be more dependable than my Mac mini. I find my new setup option to be better for the actual running of the show: I can have my iPad Pro in split screen to handle show notes in Drafts, Safari to do any real-time look-up, and the call in slide over on Skype; if I&#8217;m using FaceTime, I can simply just jump back to the call if I want by tapping the green indicator in the upper left of the screen.\nThis setup works surprisingly well. The audio quality is completely fine for anyone who&#8217;s not a die-hard purist with bottomless pockets. I&#8217;ve been testing a lot with it and can&#8217;t notice a difference in what I&#8217;ve been producing in the past. I&#8217;m trying to do this for as little as possible. For someone who has an iPad and an iPhone, you can have a complete setup \u2013 for both home and travel \u2013 for around $400 all-in, including all of the chargers, cables, usb hub, interface, and microphone.7 It&#8217;s even less if you already have chargers or a USB hub. You can even expand the setup over time, making it the most versatile setup out there.\nI think this is the best part of the mobile setup I&#8217;ve created: I don&#8217;t need to have more wires and boxes costing me hundreds of dollars more. I will always have my iPhone and iPad with me, so this just makes more sense. It also helps make my setup portable, making my mobile setup that much better. So while I impatiently wait for WWDC to bring changes to the way I can podcast using only my iPad, I have found the best possible work-around for my uses. I&#8217;ll share how I edit on iOS in my next post.\n\nHere are the items you need to create the mobile kit with your iPad Pro (2018) and iPhone:\n\nCaseling hard case\nAudio-Technica ATR2100-USB Microphone\nR\u00f8de i-XLR\nNeewer In-Ear Monitors\nCable Matters USB C to Mini USB Cable (3.3 ft)\nSatechi hub\nAnker 49.5W USB C PD + USB A Wall Charger\nAnker PowerLine+ C to C 2.0 cable (6ft)\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to everything will be below.

It&#8217;s been my trusted bag for everything: work, travel, day tripping, etc. It carries everything I could think about needing and then some. But with some changes in my needs, I started realizing that for some situations \u2013\u00a0like going to my 3rd office that is known as Chipotle \u2013 it&#8217;s way more than I need. I need something smaller on the weekends when I&#8217;m not lugging my work laptop around.<sup id=\"fnref-1530-laptop\"><a href=\"#fn-1530-laptop\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>I needed something smaller, compact, focused. I needed a <em><strong>tactical</strong></em> bag.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1530\"></span></p>\n<p>So in my quest, I started thinking about what I would need for a trip for personal life, excluding work from it completely. I started developing a list of what I would need at any given time while on the go, and I was intentionally thinking of what I really <em>needed</em> for a day run anywhere I was going. I had some other needs as well: I wanted it to be as small as possible, have some RFID shielding, and also provide some anti-theft options. I did a lot of searching, and even asked Seth \u2013\u00a0the man who has a bag for damn near anything \u2013\u00a0about what he uses for this purpose. He had recently picked up the <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/110915/pacsafe-vibe-325-crossbody-bag\">Pacsafe Vibe 325</a>. It looked like a great bag, but it was a bit more than I wanted to spend.<sup id=\"fnref-1530-rei\"><a href=\"#fn-1530-rei\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> But when I looked for that bag on Amazon, I found a few other bags that caught my eye.</p>\n<p>After a bit of sifting, I ended up finding the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D3S0BE0/?tag=nahumck-20\">Travelon Anti-Theft Urban Sling Bag</a>. While it doesn&#8217;t look tactical the way a GO RUCK bag does, this thing just screams urban tactical. Even though this is a small carry, it&#8217;s large enough for me to overpack it and get a lot inside of it.

            "content_text": "For a while now, I&#8217;ve had the same backpack. It&#8217;s been my trusted bag for everything: work, travel, day tripping, etc. It carries everything I could think about needing and then some. But with some changes in my needs, I started realizing that for some situations \u2013\u00a0like going to my 3rd office that is known as Chipotle \u2013 it&#8217;s way more than I need. I need something smaller on the weekends when I&#8217;m not lugging my work laptop around.1\nI needed something smaller, compact, focused. I needed a tactical bag.\n\nSo in my quest, I started thinking about what I would need for a trip for personal life, excluding work from it completely. I started developing a list of what I would need at any given time while on the go, and I was intentionally thinking of what I really needed for a day run anywhere I was going. I had some other needs as well: I wanted it to be as small as possible, have some RFID shielding, and also provide some anti-theft options. I did a lot of searching, and even asked Seth \u2013\u00a0the man who has a bag for damn near anything \u2013\u00a0about what he uses for this purpose. He had recently picked up the Pacsafe Vibe 325. It looked like a great bag, but it was a bit more than I wanted to spend.2 But when I looked for that bag on Amazon, I found a few other bags that caught my eye.\nAfter a bit of sifting, I ended up finding the Travelon Anti-Theft Urban Sling Bag. While it doesn&#8217;t look tactical the way a GO RUCK bag does, this thing just screams urban tactical. Even though this is a small carry, it&#8217;s large enough for me to overpack it and get a lot inside of it. I ended up getting black, even though there is a gray option I might have liked more, because it blends seamlessly with the zippers.\n\nThere are a lot of anti-theft details of this bag: there are locking zippers to keep the compartments secure as you are moving around; the bag and straps have reinforced, anti-slash materials to keep the bag from being cut off my body; and the area for cards/passports are RFID shielded. These features make it a great bag for going around town, traveling to a big city via plane, train, or bicycle. I can even put a water bottle or Yeti tumbler on either side for travel.\nThis bag holds more than I thought it would.\nWith this bag, I&#8217;m able to fit most of what I carry on a normal basis. In the bag, I have:\n\niPad Pro 11&#8243; with Smart Keyboard Folio and Apple Pencil\nAnker Wall Charger with USB-C and USB-A ports\nCord organizer containing: Anker Powerline+ USB-C to USB-C cable, Anker Powerline+ USB-C to Lightning cable, Apple USB-C to Lightning cable, and the Satechi Mobile Pro Hub3\nAirpods\nFoldable Wallet Stand\nGlyf by Studio Neat\nJoby Gorilla Pod\nMagnetic Flashlight4\nKnife\nPen\nmicrofiber cloth\nA collapsible, reusable grocery bag in case I need increase my storage in an emergency, similar to these\nGlasses case &#8211; usually carried on the side\nreduce Water Bottle\nPersonal items: Passport, corporate AMEX, a Visa gift card (for emergencies only), Kleenex, Boogie Wipes, Purell, Carmen lip balm, nail clippers, and flushable wipes\n\nThat&#8217;s a lot for me to carry on any given day; I don&#8217;t carry all of the items all the time, but it&#8217;s nice to know that I can if I want to do so.
