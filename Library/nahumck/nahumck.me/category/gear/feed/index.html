										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve added and removed multiple things from a travel kit. When I got my <a href="https://nahumck.me/tactical-bag/">tactical bag</a>, I started to think of minimal carry. In fact, it&#8217;s starting to bleed into my regular life as well. But that&#8217;s a post for another time.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, I started thinking of an all-USB-C charging setup. I&#8217;ve had other power bricks and cables, but as I move towards devices which can accept more from higher-output chargers, the idea of using USB-C only is really appealing. My iPad Pro 11&#8243; and iPhone Xs are both capable of faster charging speeds, which is really why I started my journey.<br />
<span id="more-1647"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing for my regular travel setup. And by travel, I mean trips, back and forth to work, etc. Keep in mind that I (barely) use a PC for my day job, and I don&#8217;t carry a MacBook of any kind. This setup is really for my 4 devices: iPad Pro 11&#8243;, now with a <a href="https://amzn.to/37GYolO">Cover Buddy case</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/32aG8jy">Moshi iVisor AG screen protector</a>, and the Smart Keyboard Folio; iPhone Xs; Apple Watch Series 4; and <a href="https://amzn.to/30uk2aR">AirPods Pro</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/nahumck/status/1211460824533000193">modified</a> <a href="https://amzn.to/3ajFFiz">foam tips</a> for extra comfort. I&#8217;m not always charging these devices at the same time. In fact, I&#8217;m normally charging my Apple Watch before bed, and my iPhone and iPad Pro overnight. At most, I would need 3 USB-C ports to charge. At the time of me writing this, there are zero options for a 3-port single charger, but it&#8217;s something I hope comes in the future.</p>

<p>The main source of power in my setup is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2R46M9D">AUKEY 63W PD wall charger with dual USB-C ports</a>. This is about the same size as my previous wall charger, but with a <em>lot</em> more power. The top port is an 18W PD port, and the bottom is a 60W PD port<sup id="fnref-1647-port"><a href="#fn-1647-port" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> meant more for a MacBook than an iPad. But, thanks to the technology in the iPad Pro, it can accept the maximum charging and quickly power the device.</p>
<p>For the cables, I have a single <a href="https://amzn.to/30warjD">6&#8242; Anker USB-C to USB-C cable</a> cable to power my iPad Pro and my <a href="https://amzn.to/2RreHNj">AUKEY PD Power Bank 10000mAh</a>. There are no dual USB-C battery packs available right now that I can find; but when the technology is there, I&#8217;ll replace this with a 2-port USB-C battery pack with double the capacity; that way I can charge both the iPhone and iPad to 100%. For the AirPods Pro and my iPhones, I use the 1m USB-C to Lightning cable which came with the AirPods Pro, along with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2TA8PnQ">6&#8242; Anker USB-C to Lightning cable</a>. I travel with 2 iPhones, one for work and one for travel, and might need to charge both at any given time. And given that my day job requires road trips in vehicles for testing, I recently purchased a <a href="https://amzn.to/38rUspR">Anker 2-Port USB-C Car Charger</a> to dual charge devices at 18W each; this has proven very useful on the road. I also carry my <a href="https://amzn.to/2G1f388">HyperDrive USB-C Hub 6-in-1 Adapter</a><sup id="fnref-1647-removed"><a href="#fn-1647-removed" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> along with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rxy9rD">USB-A male to USB-C female adapter</a>, which does allow me to utilize either the HyperDrive&#8217;s USB-A port or a port in the car when I&#8217;m testing and want to use CarPlay.<sup id="fnref-1647-fornow"><a href="#fn-1647-fornow" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>To facilitate the watch charging during travel, I was faced with a couple of options: keep the watch charger I have and bring another charing brick with me, buy a USB-C version of the watch charger, or try something new. I voted for the last option, and I picked up a <a href="https://amzn.to/30sTIOk">Satechi USB-C Apple Watch Charger</a>. This device plugs into my iPad Pro while I&#8217;m winding down for the day, pulling from the battery of the iPad itself. If I find that my iPad Pro is too low on power, I can simply plug this directly into the small <a href="https://amzn.to/2V0pIZy">Aukey 18W USB-C wall charger</a> I carry; it&#8217;s a little bigger than a standard iPhone 5W charging brick, but delivers 18W of power over USB-C and has a folding plug. It is a small device, which is great for travel, but I will need to be mindful about where I might leave it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been enjoying this setup. It&#8217;s not quite the ideal setup that I&#8217;m looking to achieve – a future where I have a 3-port USB wall charger and a 2-port USB-C battery pack – but it&#8217;s what I have available now. With this setup, it&#8217;s compact and fairly light, and I have charging for all of my devices no matter what the scenario. As the future moves forward to USB-C for everything, I feel like I&#8217;m ready to embrace that future, and not much on my end will need to change. Being ahead of the game isn&#8217;t a bad thing.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn-1647-port">
The 60W charging is if nothing else is plugged in. If another device is plugged in, it&#8217;s 18W PD for the top port and 45W PD for the bottom port. In my specific use case, this is more than enough for what I need.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1647-port">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-1647-removed">
I did completely remove the two pieces that come with it so that it can sit flush with the Cover Buddy case installed. It works just fine, and might actually be a bit more stable this way. But it&#8217;s something to keep in mind.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1647-removed">&#8617;</a>
</li>
<li id="fn-1647-fornow">
For now. USB-C is coming to more vehicles from everything I can see in the industry. I like that eventual future too.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1647-fornow">&#8617;</a>

<p>When I purchased iPad Pro 11&#8243;, I immediately bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZYSTNR/?tag=nahumck-20">Smart Keyboard Folio</a> (SKF, as I refer to it).<sup id="fnref-1622-first"><a href="#fn-1622-first" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> At the time, this was the best – and only – keyboard option made specifically for the iPad Pro. I needed something that wasn&#8217;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&#8217;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTSF94C/?tag=nahumck-20">11&#8243; Brydge Pro keyboard</a> review unit to try out.<br />
<span id="more-1622"></span></p>
<p>The unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&#8217;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&#8217;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&#8217;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off. When you use it in tablet mode – the mode where you can write on it with the pencil – it does prevent it from folding fully flat; you&#8217;ll have to set it off to the side to use it in that way. There&#8217;s just no room for the back panel in that device sandwich. It just feels odd to throw that to the side when you want to use it in this way.</p>

<p>The keyboard itself is a Bluetooth keyboard, and utilizes a USB-C cable to charge. You can even charge the keyboard from your iPad Pro if you&#8217;re running out of power. Out of the box, the keyboard had about 78% power, which was great to get me started. It took about 5 days for the battery to run down to where I wanted to charge it again, likely due to the backlit keys. I have found that if you&#8217;re doing a lot of typing with the keyboard lit, you&#8217;re going to drain it a lot faster.</p>
<p>Having the battery in the keyboard means it was going to be heavy compared to the SKF, which brings me to the first thing I immediately noticed about the Brydge Pro keyboard: this thing is <em>heavy</em>. Not just a little, but a lot. At 700 grams for the keyboard and the protective cover, it more than doubles the weight of the iPad Pro<sup id="fnref-1622-weight"><a href="#fn-1622-weight" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> carry in my bag; compare that to the SKF, which clocks in at just 302 grams, and it&#8217;s clear to see that you need to be very comfortable with the extra weight if you&#8217;re going to carry this around. It may not seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s significant. The extra weight is great for when you&#8217;re using it in your lap, however, like when you&#8217;re on a couch or as I did in a car while on a road trip; the SKF tends to be more top-heavy,<sup id="fnref-1622-heavy"><a href="#fn-1622-heavy" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup> and doesn&#8217;t feel as stable in those instances whereas the Brydge felt solid.</p>
<p>The next thing I noticed: the keyboard is a bit narrower than the SKF. Being that this is the 11&#8243; model, that width can take some getting used to. But I was able to adapt over the first several days. The placement of the Siri key is also a bit difficult with the layout, as my finger often presses is when I&#8217;m attempting to use the control key. Again, this layout just takes some getting use to and is not insurmountable; I&#8217;m even trying to utilize Siri more now with this key, using the Type to Siri accessibility feature, and the availability of such a key is welcome. Having the media keys above the row is great. I really wish that Apple would figure out how to make this happen. I&#8217;ve suggested a couple of different ways before, but I doubt they&#8217;d ever consider it.<sup id="fnref-1622-idea"><a href="#fn-1622-idea" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>My review unit did have a couple of issues: I noticed that the lettering on the keys weren&#8217;t straight. I notice these sorts of things all the time as part of my day job, so it was immediately apparent to me. It&#8217;s not a deal breaker by any means, and my hope is that it is because this is an early review unit. The main issue that I did have with the keyboard has been the missed keystrokes. It&#8217;s not all the time, but when it does happen, it takes me out of my writing focus. I reached out to the team at Brydge to let them know, and not only did they quickly respond acknowledging my concern while assuring me that this is not normal and they wanted to inspect the unit to see what was going on, but they also shipped me a new one the day after. Issues can happen in products from time to time, and even though this appears to be an isolated incident, the quick customer service experience and the fact that Brydge stand by their products is fantastic. The second unit I used did not have this issue, and most of my missed keystrokes were due to the more narrow keyboard or my lack of force to activate the key travel.</p>
<p>Overall, I really like the Brydge Pro keyboard. The keys feel very good, the infinite angles and better lap capability are very versatile, and it really does make this combination of Brydge keyboard and iPad Pro feel like a traditional laptop. But I also couldn&#8217;t help but notice that this might not be the best keyboard for me for the way I do work. In my day job, I&#8217;m often moving between typing and notetaking with the Apple Pencil, and the Brydge is more cumbersome for that particular way of working. I can lay it fully flat, but that doesn&#8217;t work as well sitting on my lap.</p>
<p>At the end of my time with the review unit, I came away mixed: it&#8217;s not as flexible for my style of working, but it&#8217;s a really fantastic option for the iPad Pro. I&#8217;m likely keeping my iPad Pro for a few more years, so having this option in addition to the Smart Keyboard Folio and the Smart Folio (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H88J5GS/?tag=nahumck-20">knockoff</a>) is the trifecta, and something I&#8217;m excited to add to my kit portfolio. I might, however, wait a bit before I buy this: with iPadOS 13 and the addition of an accessibility feature which provides cursor support, I can&#8217;t help but think that Brydge might be working on a trackpad edition, similar to the version they have for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GJ92LX/?tag=nahumck-20">Surface Pro</a>. If this existed, I wouldn&#8217;t have to carry an extra piece of kit in my bag. If they added that feature, it would push me over the edge for sure. But if you&#8217;re in the market for a laptop-like keyboard, I cannot recommend this one enough.</p>

My idea: turn the &#8220;globe&#8221; key in the bottom left of the keyboard with a &#8220;FN&#8221; key. Add the media functions to the number keys in the same way. This would also allow for the addition of a hard-key Siri button if you press and held the combination for a home button. Again, this is <em>a</em> way to solve it, and certainly not the way I envision Apple would do it. But I really wouldn&#8217;t mind it being there.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1622-idea">&#8617;</a>

<p>I got into podcasting late. I&#8217;ve been listening for years, but I never started my own. But by the time that <a href="https://nahumck.me/fundamentally-broken/">Seth and I did</a>, there was an emerging idea started by Jason Snell: <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/recording-a-podcast-locally-on-ios-without-a-mac/">recording</a> and <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">editing</a> podcasts iOS-only. As someone who rarely ever touches a Mac for their day-to-day work, this idea has continued to gnaw at my brain. I tried my hand a couple of times at doing something differently with it, but it never panned out the way I wanted.</p>
<p>In an effort to head down this road, I ended up switching microphones last year: I had the clutch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2/?tag=nahumck-20">Blue Yeti</a> microphone, but decided on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/?tag=nahumck-20">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a> instead. Not only was it better for the environment in which I record, but it also afforded me the possibility to record using both the USB and XLR connections, pushing me closer to the goal of iOS-only.</p>
<p>A month or so ago, I was recording the show via the late-2012 Mac mini I have. I ended up having an issue while recording, and I lost my audio in several spots. Given that this is one of two jobs that I ever ask it to do, I was understandably upset and put off by recording in the same way going forward. The idea of going iOS-only came back to the forefront of my mind. I again turned to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/">Jason&#8217;s setup</a>, only to realize that this was going to cost me several hundred dollars to create. I don&#8217;t have that lying around, and I wanted to find something that would work for me.<br />
<span id="more-1590"></span></p>
<p>I can already record iOS-only: I can use my iPhone with AirPods to make the call and use my iPad Pro to record the local audio. This is how I recorded my end when I guested on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators/23">Episode 23 of the Automators podcast</a>. I enjoyed doing this, but I also don&#8217;t have a great way of having the good audio from my mic broadcast to the other hosts. I like the idea of using the iOS devices I have to record: I&#8217;m always going to have them with me, so it just makes more sense to use them for the complete audio setup. I can use either device to record or make the call, I just need a way to get the sound of the mic to both of them. So that&#8217;s where my search started. I had most of what I needed, I just needed an XLR interface of some type. Rather than search &#8216;USB XLR interface&#8217; like I had done multiple times before, I ended up just searching for &#8216;XLR interface&#8217;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I ended up finding something new and unique: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LS9JI22/?tag=nahumck-20">Røde i-XLR</a>. This device was made for reporters, plugging into an XLR microphone and allowing mobile recording of interviews; when I saw it, I thought it might work perfectly for podcasting as well. Rather than take my XLR connection through an <a href="https://www.sounddevices.com/product/usbpre-2/">expensive USB interface</a> into an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DPOXS8I/?tag=nahumck-20">XLR recorder</a> of some type or another adaptor to my iPhone, this allows me to use my XLR connection and plug it directly into the iPhone without all the extra cables and steps. There&#8217;s even an app – the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r%C3%B8de-reporter/id1066635435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Røde Recorder</a> – which was specifically made for this microphone. The idea was intriguing, so I decided to purchase it and test it out.</p>

Don’t judge my drawing skills.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&#8217;s how my setup is all connected, using my iPad Pro 2018 and my iPhone Xs.<sup id="fnref-1590-links"><a href="#fn-1590-links" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> First, I start with the power: I recommend using this Anker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0721DV7YX/?tag=nahumck-20">wall-charger</a>, which provides a Power Delivery USB-C port along with a USB-A quick charge. I use it all the time for travel, and it&#8217;s perfect for what I need. I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LNA0XCU/?tag=nahumck-20">USB-C to USB-C</a> to power the iPad. Next, I connect the USB microphone cable to the iPad Pro using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K6YFW7X/?tag=nahumck-20">Satechi hub</a>;<sup id="fnref-1590-hub"><a href="#fn-1590-hub" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> this also allows me to use the HDMI for an external monitor and the USB-C port to power everything. Then, I connect the Røde iXLR to the end of the cable which comes with the microphone, and plug that into my iPhone directly. Finally, I connect the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LPTAYI/?tag=nahumck-20">over-the-ear headphones</a> to the the Røde iXLR and do a test recording to dial in the sound level for the environment. When I have that part set and I&#8217;m happy with the audio, I&#8217;ll connect the monitors directly to the back of the microphone so I can use them for the audio call; I can monitor the sound visually using Røde Reporter or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Ferrite</a>. I prefer using Ferrite due to the smaller file sizes and better recording controls for volume as well as the ability to bookmark the audio when topic change and/or I cough; it helps me in the edit later. However, I have noticed that using the configuration menu in Røde Reporter allows me to use a -20 dB pad for the mic, resulting in quieter background noise and an overall better sound.</p>
<p>I did run into one small technical issue when getting this all set up: when the i-XLR is connected to the iPhone, the cellular radio creates an interference with the audio. To avoid this in the audio track, I have to turn on airplane mode,<sup id="fnref-1590-Seth"><a href="#fn-1590-Seth" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup> then turn on the WiFi and then record. It&#8217;s a simple issue, and one that I&#8217;m not too concerned about: I can still get calls or messages if something is urgent. I also don&#8217;t want to be disturbed when I&#8217;m recording so that I can give the other person (or people) my fullest attention possible, so it&#8217;s a non-issue for me.<sup id="fnref-1590-device"><a href="#fn-1590-device" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>With a few more additions, not only can I have an iOS-setup at home, I can also have a <em>completely mobile</em> setup as well. I can start recording more often, no matter where I am: whether it&#8217;s traveling for work, going to my parents house on a short weekend trip, or taking a long-overdue vacation, I can record from wherever I am. I bought some inexpensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0798JB6S3/?tag=nahumck-20">in-ear monitors</a> and some duplicate cables, which complete the mobile setup. It all fits into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XXFQB8M/?tag=nahumck-20">hard-side case</a> made for my specific microphone, and the entire case fits in the bottom of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019TQP442/?tag=nahumck-20">travel backpack</a>, meaning I can go anywhere and record.</p>

<p>From here on out, I&#8217;m going to be recording iOS-only using this setup: my iPhone will record my local audio, and my iPad Pro will handle the call. The only bit that I don&#8217;t have is the recording of the call itself, which isn&#8217;t a big deal to me as long as the people I&#8217;m recording with know what they are doing. This setup allows me to use my iOS devices which have shown to be more dependable than my Mac mini. I find my new setup option to be better for the actual running of the show: I can have my iPad Pro in split screen to handle show notes in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a>, Safari to do any real-time look-up, and the call in slide over on Skype; if I&#8217;m using FaceTime, I can simply just jump back to the call if I want by tapping the green indicator in the upper left of the screen.</p>
<p>This setup works surprisingly well. The audio quality is completely fine for anyone who&#8217;s not a die-hard purist with bottomless pockets. I&#8217;ve been testing a lot with it and can&#8217;t notice a difference in what I&#8217;ve been producing in the past. I&#8217;m trying to do this for as little as possible. For someone who has an iPad and an iPhone, you can have a complete setup – for both home and travel – for around $400 all-in, including all of the chargers, cables, usb hub, interface, and microphone.<sup id="fnref-1590-total"><a href="#fn-1590-total" class="jetpack-footnote">7</a></sup> It&#8217;s even less if you already have chargers or a USB hub. You can even expand the setup over time, making it the most versatile setup out there.</p>
<p>I think this is the best part of the mobile setup I&#8217;ve created: I don&#8217;t need to have more wires and boxes costing me hundreds of dollars more. I will always have my iPhone and iPad with me, so this just makes more sense. It also helps make my setup portable, making my <a href="https://nahumck.me/perfectly-mobile/">mobile setup</a> that much better. So while I impatiently wait for WWDC to bring changes to the way I can podcast using only my iPad, I have found the best possible work-around for my uses. I&#8217;ll share how I edit on iOS in my next post.</p>

This is the hub I use which works with my iPad Pro. You can use a multitude of others, or if you have a different iPad, you can use one that works for you.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1590-hub">&#8617;</a>

If you have an older device laying around which supports Ferrite or Rode Reporter, you can use this as the &#8220;storage&#8221; device if you really have an issue with what I&#8217;ve described here.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1590-device">&#8617;</a>

there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSQFIRE/?tag=nahumck-20">package deal</a> which includes the mic, a boom arm, and a pop filter that I would recommend.

<p>For a while now, I&#8217;ve had the same <a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/us/en/product/momentum-30-MOMENTUM30.html">backpack</a>. It&#8217;s been my trusted bag for everything: work, travel, day tripping, etc. It carries everything I could think about needing and then some. But with some changes in my needs, I started realizing that for some situations – like going to my 3rd office that is known as Chipotle – it&#8217;s way more than I need. I need something smaller on the weekends when I&#8217;m not lugging my work laptop around.<sup id="fnref-1530-laptop"><a href="#fn-1530-laptop" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I needed something smaller, compact, focused. I needed a <em><strong>tactical</strong></em> bag.<br />
<span id="more-1530"></span></p>
<p>So in my quest, I started thinking about what I would need for a trip for personal life, excluding work from it completely. I started developing a list of what I would need at any given time while on the go, and I was intentionally thinking of what I really <em>needed</em> for a day run anywhere I was going. I had some other needs as well: I wanted it to be as small as possible, have some RFID shielding, and also provide some anti-theft options. I did a lot of searching, and even asked Seth – the man who has a bag for damn near anything – about what he uses for this purpose. He had recently picked up the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/110915/pacsafe-vibe-325-crossbody-bag">Pacsafe Vibe 325</a>. It looked like a great bag, but it was a bit more than I wanted to spend.<sup id="fnref-1530-rei"><a href="#fn-1530-rei" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> But when I looked for that bag on Amazon, I found a few other bags that caught my eye.</p>
<p>After a bit of sifting, I ended up finding the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D3S0BE0/?tag=nahumck-20">Travelon Anti-Theft Urban Sling Bag</a>. While it doesn&#8217;t look tactical the way a GO RUCK bag does, this thing just screams urban tactical. Even though this is a small carry, it&#8217;s large enough for me to overpack it and get a lot inside of it. I ended up getting black, even though there is a gray option I might have liked more, because it blends seamlessly with the zippers.</p>

<p>There are a lot of anti-theft details of this bag: there are locking zippers to keep the compartments secure as you are moving around; the bag and straps have reinforced, anti-slash materials to keep the bag from being cut off my body; and the area for cards/passports are RFID shielded. These features make it a great bag for going around town, traveling to a big city via plane, train, or bicycle. I can even put a water bottle or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B073WJX9ZV/?tag=nahumck-20">Yeti tumbler</a> on either side for travel.</p>

</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot for me to carry on any given day; I don&#8217;t carry all of the items all the time, but it&#8217;s nice to know that I can if I want to do so. And while my goal of this bag was to be light-carry, this bag makes all of this <em>feel</em> minimal when I&#8217;m out and about, even when it&#8217;s packed full.</p>
<p>I really love the way this has turned out. I wish I could use this all the time, but there are some things that I do need to carry during the weekday which force me to use my backpack. There is, however, a clear delineation with which bag I grab now. But for the times where I need to be minimal while still being dangerous, this will be my go-to tactical bag for the future.</p>

Funny thing is that I decreased the weight of my work laptop by 4 lbs, but yet I still find carrying the thing a pain in my ass.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1530-laptop">&#8617;</a>

This was a Secret Santa gift given to me by my cousin. It&#8217;s monogrammed on the front as well. It&#8217;s perfect for what I need.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1530-gift">&#8617;</a>

I got this at a local store. This is the best approximation of what I have. Cannot say I recommend it because I didn&#8217;t buy this exact one, but it&#8217;s similar. YMMV.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1530-local">&#8617;</a>
