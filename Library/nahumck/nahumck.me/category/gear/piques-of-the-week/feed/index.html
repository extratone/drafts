										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve done one of these, but I wanted to share some of the things that have been piquing my interest as of late. I&#8217;ve made some good purchases on a few times, and wanted to share them.<br />
<span id="more-1450"></span></p>
<h3>iPad Case with Pencil</h3>
<p>For a long time, I used the Logitech Create. Then I switched to the Smart Keyboard, as it made more sense to me. I purchased a back cover that I thought was ok, and then a magnetic pen holder. But… I really missed how the Create was able to hold my pencil for the few times I use it. Based on my Amazon search history, I ended up finding a new <a href="https://amzn.to/2LLk3y5">iPad Case w/ integrated Pencil holder</a>. And it&#8217;s really what I wanted in the first place.</p>
<p>The case provides a rubberized surround, which integrates the Pencil holder. There are two small cut-outs on the back side of the Pencil, so that I can remove it quickly. Once I&#8217;m done, the Pencil is secured, nearly encapsulated by the rubber. It also has a cutout for the Smart Keyboard attachment, and doesn&#8217;t interfere with anything. This is by far the best combination I&#8217;ve used for portability and mode switching. I also know that there are cases like this for the other size devices, so give those a look as well if you&#8217;re not using the 9.7&#8243; like me.</p>
<h3>Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Microphone</h3>
<p>When I started in to my <a href="https://nahumck.me/fundamentally-broken/">podcasting life</a>, I had purchased the recommendation de-jour for a microphone: the <a href="https://amzn.to/2osbYVC">Blue Yeti</a>. And that mic has served me well for a while. But one thing that has been a problem for me as of late has been the recording device that I use, a gifted 2009 Mac mini. It&#8217;s an ok device for this purpose, but it&#8217;s getting a bit long in the tooth.</p>
<p>So, in a quest to simplify things, I wanted to mirror <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/recording-a-podcast-locally-on-ios-without-a-mac/">the setup</a> first mentioned by Jason Snell on Six Colors. This idea of recording on iOS only really appeals to me, as I don&#8217;t edit on a Mac. So I set out on my quest to start this process now. I sold my Yeti and picked up the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pq48Yp">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB/XLR Microphone</a>. While I haven&#8217;t recorded an episode yet with it, I have done multiple sound tests. And it&#8217;s on par with the Yeti for quality, but it has one benefit for where I record: a reduction in background noise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve changed my entire setup now, which is great. I need far less around me, and I&#8217;m happy about it. I think the recording will sound better on my end overall, and I&#8217;ll be happier using it. I did encounter a bug where iOS is not letting me use the mic for FaceTime or Skype calling. This was possible before, and is a bug that has been introduced in iOS 12. I&#8217;ve sent in reports on it, and I hope it gets fixed before release.</p>
<h3>Newer Boom Arm</h3>
<p>In the change of microphone, the weight has decreased significantly. And now that I don&#8217;t need foam around the mic like I did before, I wanted to try it on a boom arm. I picked up the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Pk7Fay">Neewer Boom Arm</a> and bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/2C5IVky">shock mount</a> for it as well. It&#8217;s up and out of the way when I don&#8217;t need it, but it&#8217;s right there when I do. I would have liked a slightly longer arm, but it does the job well for being inexpensive.</p>
<hr />
<p>All of this stuff is really driving towards making an iPad-only life a reality. There&#8217;s really only one thing preventing me from going that route forever,<sup id="fnref-1450-1"><a href="#fn-1450-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> and I can&#8217;t wait until Apple makes it possible. I even picked up an <a href="https://amzn.to/2N82JYK">iPad stand</a> based on another recommendation, pairing the iPad with the Magic Keyboard when recording. This puts the iPad right at eye level, which is better than constantly looking down. The whole thing feels like an overhaul for me, without costing me a ton of money; the only purchase left is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ALPUFYO/?tag=nahumck-20">Zoom H4</a> recorder, which I can wait on for a while. This setup – even though it may not seem simpler – makes me feel like I&#8217;m headed in the right direction.</p>

<h2>iPhone 8 Plus + Portrait Mode</h2>
<p>I said I wasn&#8217;t going to upgrade. I was just going to keep my 7 Plus and not bother with the hassle of going to the store and getting a new phone. I didn&#8217;t want to get yet another case; I&#8217;m partial to the <a title="iPhone 8 Plus / 7 Plus Leather Case - Charcoal Gray" href="https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MQHP2ZM/A">Apple Leather Case</a> for my phones, and spending yet another $50 on one wasn&#8217;t appealing.</p>
<p>But as I looked more into it, there were some appealing features. Apple also removed some of the friction for me: the iPhone Upgrade Program was streamlined to be done through the mail at home;<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> my beloved case could be reused on this new phone. I was also reminded a friend of mine that I got into the upgrade program for a reason. And I have childlike will power with things like this. So, naturally, I upgraded.</p>
<p>The phone is great. It&#8217;s even more capable than the 7 Plus, and I thought that was plenty fine. The updated hardware is great: faster chipsets, upgraded specs, new (to the iPhone) technologies, and the improvements to the screen thanks to True Tone. All of the this is enhanced by the features in iOS 11. But the one place Apple &#8211; and Phil Schiller &#8211; really push the phone to new heights is the camera.</p>
<p>The iPhone optics and sensors make this a fantastic point-and-shoot camera. At the very least, it is good enough to bring with you and not have to carry around another electronic item. Sure, there will always be those that prefer a true DSLR and lenses galore. But having a camera always with you in your pocket is great to capture a lot of moments.</p>
<p>With the improvements to portrait mode and the additional features brought to the iPhone 8 Plus, this camera is simply stunning. There are <a href="http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-8-camera-review-india">much better photographers</a> out there that can take way better photos than I can. But it really is amazing that my not quite 5-year-old can take a photo that looks really great. I had to instruct him what to wait for, but once he got it and knew when to snap the photo, he has been able to take some great photos on his own. The photo below was taken by him; it is a portrait mode photo with the contour light mode selected. My dad told me it was one of the best photos taken of me in years. I’m really looking forward to the images that I — and more importantly my son — can take with the new phone and the new features in the future.</p>

<h2>Anker Wireless Charging Pad</h2>
<p>I’ll admit, when I saw this I shrugged my shoulders. It didn’t seem like it was something I was going to need in my life. I have about a dozen extra lightning cables and [ineffective] small wall chargers that I get with new devices. I have plenty of places I can get power.</p>
<p>I thought I should, at the very least, get one to try. I’m huge fan of Anker products: they make great stuff and reasonable prices. I have an assortment of stuff from them — <a title="Anker 4-port Wall Charger " href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2HIR9R/?tag=nahumck-20">wall</a> <a title="Anker 60W/6-Port Charger" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P936188/?tag=nahumck-20">chargers</a>, <a title="Anker Powerline Lighting Cable - 6ft" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0177NZ59S/?tag=nahumck-20">lightning cables</a>, a <a title="Anker Soundcore Bluetooth Speaker" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016XTADG2/?tag=nahumck-20">Bluetooth speaker</a>, etc. — and all of them are fantastic. So when I wanted to search for wireless charging, I sought out Anker for my needs. I found the <a title="Anker Wireless Charging Pad - Amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KJL4XNY/?tag=nahumck-20">Anker Wireless Charging Pad</a> which was compatible with the fast-charging on iOS (with the right adaptor and a forthcoming iOS update).</p>
<p>And go figure &#8211; it’s exactly what I never knew I always wanted. Being able to set my phone down at night and just let it charge has been a delight. I’m curious to see when it gets the fast charging later this year, but for overnight it is perfect for what I need.</p>
<p>I’m sure I will test other options in the future, but for now this little puck has brought me simple joy.</p>
<h2>Apple Watch Sport Loop Band</h2>
<p><em>Hello, my name is Tim, and I have a watch band problem.</em></p>
<p>There, I’ve said it. I feel better. But it doesn’t change the fact that I’m likely going to buy more bands. I have a lot of sport bands in multiple colors — 11 in total. I have a Milanese loop and a <a href="https://www.monoweardesign.com/products/active-nylon-band">Monowear nylon active band</a> in olive green. I really like coordinating them with my outfit and having different options for the activity I’m doing, whether it be working out or yardwork. For example, I have a Nike sport band (knockoff) for when I work out. And while it’s nice to have the breathability with the extra holes, it still picks up a ton of sweat. It was the best solution for me at the time.</p>
<p>Enter the <a title="42mm Black Sport Loop" href="https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MQW72AM/A">Sport Loop</a> for the Apple Watch. This thing is awesome. It&#8217;s basically the cloth equivalent to the Milanese loop. It&#8217;s breathable, soft, and holds my watch snugly in place without being too tight. I&#8217;ve worn it while working out and sweating profusely. I’ve also worn it in the shower, and it was dry before I left the bathroom; it doesn’t stay waterlogged like you think it would.</p>
<p>To date, this is my favorite band; I haven&#8217;t taken it off since I got it. I keep looking at all of the other bands and wondering if I even need them. I look forward to additional colors as time goes on.<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> If you have the money, I highly recommend picking one up.</p>
<ol id="footnotes">
<li id="fn1">Seriously, the ease of doing this and not going to the store is huge, and reduces the anxiety I would feel when going to the store. The packaging for it was phenomenal. Highly recommend this option for anyone out there, even when your store is down the street. <a href="#ffn1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn2">What, you thought I was going to stop at just one? <a href="#ffn2"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>

					<description><![CDATA[This time it's all about my luggage.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In preparation for my upcoming trip, I wanted to make sure I had the right stuff for travel. Being that travel preparation is so important, I wanted to make sure I had the right stuff. I wanted to travel light, small, and better than I have previously ever done. In my research, I found these items:<br />
<span id="more-1160"></span></p>
<h2>Dash Hardside Carry-on by Brookstone</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve wanted a piece hardside luggage for a while. From what others have shared with me, it can allow you to pack more while using less space. And while there are many travel professionals out there with their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HEO2V3E/?tag=nahumck-20" title="Dash Pro Hardside Suitcase">ultra-fancy suitcases</a>, I didn&#8217;t need that much for travel. I ended up finding the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H2IKES0/?tag=nahumck-20" title="Dash Hardside Suitcase">Dash Hardside Carry-on by Brookstone</a> as a perfect carry-on bag.</p>
<p>Why a carry-on? A couple of reasons. First, I tend to overpack.<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> But I need to travel extremely light for the trip I&#8217;m undertaking. I can also do laundry when I&#8217;m there, so I&#8217;ll be good. Second, I wanted a bag not only for this trip, but for future family trips where that can be our carry-on bag. The Dash is designed to fit into any overhead bin. With the 360° spinning wheels (which I love so much), it&#8217;s going to be great for going through the airport.</p>
<p>This bag is light-weight at 7lbs thanks to the polycarbonate shell, and I&#8217;ve been able to pack a lot of things in there thanks to the expansion zipper and some other travel accessories which I&#8217;ll get into below. I&#8217;m all packed and ready to go for this trip, and I&#8217;m thankful I&#8217;ll have this bag with me.</p>
<h2>Eagle Creek Garment Folder</h2>
<p>Packing a lot of clothes in your suitcase can be tricky. And even though some bags allow you to compress the items within, there are some other options to help minimize the space certain garments take up. Enter the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F9S81KY/?tag=nahumck-20">Eagle Creek Garment Folder</a>.</p>
<p>This folder comes with a helpful folding board with instructions. The two wings on the sides offer compression of the clothes to help minimize wrinkles and save space in your bag. And at 12&#8243; x 18&#8243;, it fits perfectly inside my 20&#8243; carry-on.</p>
<h2>Packing Cubes</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never really thought of using packing cubes. But for one reason or another,<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> I ended up finding some to try out. First, there are a lot of options. But I ended up going with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E923R5E/?tag=nahumck-20">Mossio Packing Cubes</a>: there are 3 cubes, 3 laundry bags, and 1 shoe bag. And for $15, this seemed like the best deal for me to try.</p>
<p>While they are inexpensive, these bags are hardly cheap in feel. They use YKK zippers stitching, and have a thicker nylon fabric. The bags and cubes come in small, medium, and large sizes. The cubes fit nicely in the bottom of my bag, arranged neatly. Next to them are the laundry bags that also contained some items. I was able to place the garment sleeve on top of these, and the entire other side of my suitcase was left open.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so happy with these, that I&#8217;ve ordered 3 additional sets: one for each member of our family, each in a different color. This will be very helpful for longer family trips: we can cut down on the number of bags we take, and use the packing cubes to distinguish which close belong to which person. For $60 total, we will be more organized as a family. I&#8217;m all for this.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;m traveling for 2 weeks straight. And while there will be an opportunity for me to do laundry, I&#8217;m going to be happy that I&#8217;m able to pack everything I could need into my new suitcase and my <a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com/us/en/product/momentum-30-MOMENTUM30.html">backpack</a>. Bon voyage!</p>
<ol id="footnotes">
<li id="fn1">I like being prepared <a href="#ffn1">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="fn2">That other reason being Amazon Prime Day and a bunch of them were on sale <a href="#ffn2">&#8617;</a></li>

<h2>Smart Cover for iPad Pro</h2>
<p>When I first purchased my iPad Pro 9.7, I immediately wanted to get the Logitech Create Keyboard Case. That has served me very well, and something that I have <a href="https://nahumck.me/piques-of-the-week-volume-10/">really enjoyed</a>. But there are a lot of times when I&#8217;m just going around the house where the added heft of the functional case really didn&#8217;t work well. I started to remove the iPad from the case fairly often, but lost some functionality.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I thought to pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DOQR680/?tag=nahumck-20">Smart Cover for iPad Pro 9.7</a>. Not only does the Smart Cover allow for protection of the screen, but it also can prop up the device in two modes: the &#8220;viewing&#8221; mode and the &#8220;typing&#8221; mode.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The viewing mode allows me to FaceTime with family, watch a show or two, or read the news if I feel like screaming into the void. The typing mode allows me to respond to people without having my device in a heavier case; this does require me using the on-screen keyboard, however. I can also pair the device with my magic keyboard for longer writing, which might come in handy for a large fall review that I&#8217;ll be working on.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll even store my pencil up at the top, which is secured by the magnets. The pencil also fits in the groove on the front of the Smart Cover, but I&#8217;m nervous about it falling off and me losing it; it&#8217;s not something I often do while moving about, but while it&#8217;s on my desk or on my counter, I will keep it around.</p>
<p>If I had the choice to do it over again, I might have picked up the <a href="#">Smart Keyboard</a>, but I like having the options. Using the on-screen keyboard has showing me that the larger devices might be better suited for that use case; either way, if I upgraded to the larger size, I&#8217;d likely get the Smart Cover for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071WLJW7Z/?tag=nahumck-20">10.5</a> / <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B071JNCP9W/?tag=nahumck-20">12.9</a>. Highly recommended for sleek carry and around the house use.</p>
<h2>Akwox Silicone Cover for Siri Remote</h2>
<p>With multiple devices around the TV, there comes multiple remotes. And while I could get some sort of universal remote for everything, I much prefer using the remotes that come with the devices.</p>
<p>We have a small remote caddy at home, but one remote we have the most problems with is the Apple TV Siri remote: it&#8217;s always getting misplaced, and because the face is black, there&#8217;s a risk of it being lost. So rather than continuing to look around, I thought I would get a smarter solution &#8211; to Amazon!</p>

<p>I did a quick search for Apple TV remote silicone case, and arrived at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NA9TATV/?tag=nahumck-20">Akwox Silicone Cover for Siri Remote</a>. There are multiple color options, but if we are going to see it in our house, I wanted to get something bright. I settled on a bright orange color for easy visibility. The case is a nice fit, and even helps point which way is up. For $7, I won&#8217;t have to worry about losing the expensive remote any longer.</p>

<li id="fn1">This is just my nomenclature for these. I can use the typing mode for note taking or drawing with my pencil, if I wanted. <a href="#ffn1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
