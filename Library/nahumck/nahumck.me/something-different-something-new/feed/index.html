If you look in the post &quot;Something Different, Something New&quot; there is a hyperlink for SFMono. Follow that, and you can download the zip file. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/anyfont/id821560738?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AnyFont&lt;/a&gt; to install fonts on iOS.]]></description>

Though I think your main point is that they both include this text in the preview(export?) and Ulysses doesn&#039;t. Still - why not use double tildes (or at least recognise them) in Markdown XL? As many commands as possible should be the same across platforms (give us extra, yes, but don&#039;t change existing ones please).]]></description>
