										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though Seth and I <a href="https://nahumck.me/fully-broken/">no longer have a podcast</a>, we still talk nearly daily about a lot of things. One of them is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&#038;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a>, and how we are using it for small life improvements here and there. Journaling is one of them, and it has become a part of standard practice for me. I don&#8217;t always have to put something in that&#8217;s poignant, but I do document quite a bit from time to time. I&#8217;m not perfect at it, but I try to do the best that I can. After all, it&#8217;s for me – so if I don&#8217;t do well at it, I&#8217;m only disappointing myself…</p>
<p>I journal using Drafts because I trust the system. Using Shortcuts, I run an automation in the morning to create the entry at 4:00am so I never miss a day; this entry is created in a specific format with the <code>journal</code> tag, date heading in <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code> format, and some weather and date information. I have another automation that runs just before midnight to save it as a nice-looking PDF at night and archive the draft. I still keep all the journal entries in Drafts: they live in my Journal workspace in the archive folder at the top of the drafts list. I keep them just in case I need to search for something later, even though I hardly do it. But there are times where I might want to go back and review them just to see what happened in the past. One of Seth&#8217;s problems was that he wanted a way to review things that happened on that day throughout the life of his digital journal. We used to use Shortcuts to do this, but that&#8217;s cumbersome at best. Why use another app when Drafts is perfectly suited for this? Seth ended up finding <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/tip-use-temporary-workspaces-to-filter-the-draft-list/3030">this forum tip</a> on creating temporary workspaces, which admittedly was from a while ago (November <em>2018</em>). Even though a lot of you think I&#8217;m an expert, there&#8217;s quite a bit of this stuff that I don&#8217;t know or use.</p>
<p>Using this example, I was able to create an action to show what happened <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1qP">On This Date</a>. In simple terms, it searches for all drafts tagged <code>journal</code>, then searches for a string of the current date in <code>mm-dd</code> format; the action then has some code to let you filter the look of it, then load the workspace. I added a few things because I want to keep my Journal themes applied when creating this temporary workspace.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through the code a bit. First, you&#8217;ll find some configurable variables for your searching. This sets the name of the temporary workspace, the tags you want to include (or omit using <code>!tag</code>), and some strings to search.</p>
<pre><code>//BEGIN config variables
//setup tags or searches you wish to load...
let name = "On This Date";
let tagFilter = "journal"
const now = new Date()
const date = now.toString("MM-dd")
let queryString = date;
let group = ActionGroup.find("Journal");
app.loadActionGroup(group);
let lTheme = Theme.find("custom", "Journal Light");
let dTheme = Theme.find("custom", "Journal Dark");
//END config variables
</code></pre>
<p>I also added the action groups I use for journaling as well as my journaling themes as variables, since I want to make sure I use them later in the action. Now that all that is configured, we can set up the workspace:</p>
<pre><code>//create workspace
//for other options, see:
//https://reference.getdrafts.com/objects/Workspace.html
let ws = Workspace.create();
ws.name = name;
ws.tagFilter = tagFilter;
ws.queryString = queryString;
ws.setInboxSort("created", true);
ws.loadFolder = "all";
ws.showPreview = false;
ws.showTags = false;
ws.showLastAction = false;
ws.showDate = false;
ws.loadActionBarGroup = group;
ws.loadActionListGroup = group;
//ws.lightTheme = lTheme;
//ws.darkTheme = dTheme;
</code></pre>
<p>There&#8217;s a surprising amount of customization. I did find out that there was an undocumented <code>.showDate</code> customization that I could take advantage of. The only thing I would like to see added here is <code>.lightTheme</code> and <code>.darkTheme</code> so that I can set the themes directly with the temporary workspace which would eliminate the need for me to call them using the other methods; maybe those will get added in the future. The last part applies the workspace, shows the draft list, and applies my themes. I appreciated the callout in the original action, so I kept it in there: the workspace is temporary unless you use the <code>.update()</code> function, very much akin to a temporary draft to store information.</p>
<pre><code>//unless you call `ws.update()`, this ws is temporary
//load this workspace, and display draft list
app.applyWorkspace(ws);
app.showDraftList();

//set the Journal themes
app.lightTheme = lTheme;
app.darkTheme = dTheme;
</code></pre>
<p>Actions like this can seem like a lot at first, but they are fairly simple enough to manage. This action can bring a lot of awareness and possibly even some joy to your day, looking back on the things you&#8217;ve done in the past. I&#8217;ve also included this in my widgets: I&#8217;ve found that I use it more often this way, and it&#8217;s a great use of a widget action for Drafts.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have to admit, this is the first time in a while that I&#8217;ve done something like this to change some of my workflows. Not because I don&#8217;t adore Drafts, but because of how life has been going for me (all good things, thankfully). But it makes me wonder: <em>what else am I missing</em>? Seems like a great time to go exploring…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my second appearance on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/automators/73">Automators</a> (part of the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/">Relay FM</a> network),<sup id="fnref-2049-first"><a href="#fn-2049-first" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> I&#8217;m back to talk with David Sparks and Rosemary Orchard once again about <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a>. We dive in on some of the new stuff from <a href="https://nahumck.me/drafts-26-the-customization-update/">version 26</a> which introduced custom themes and syntaxes. We also touch on a few other <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/misc/changelog-ios.html">updates</a> from the first version to now as well. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>There were a couple of things in the episode that I wanted to follow-up on here, including the homework assignment David gave me. I&#8217;m thrilled that the time spent with David and Rosemary gave me the idea, which made me reconsider some things with my personal journaling and changed how I&#8217;m doing it going forward.<br />
<span id="more-2049"></span></p>
<h3>Theme Switching with Workspaces</h3>
<p>Ever since I&#8217;ve used workspaces + action groups to create what I called modules, I&#8217;ve used a script actions to switch between them. Originally, I set each workspace, action group, and keyboard row individually; once the action and keyboard group options were added to the workspace manager, I simplified the actions. I keep the single action in every one of my action groups which I use in the keyboard row to use on the iPhone for quick access to switch. Where I use this switching method a lot is on my iPad, using a hardware keyboard. All of my modules are brought up with keyboard shortcuts, assigned to <code>⌘2 - 9</code>; both <code>⌘1</code> and <code>⌘9</code> are reserved by Drafts for the draft and action list show/hide, respectively.</p>
<p>With the addition of themes, I&#8217;ve now modified the modules I have to include themes that I want to use in those different contexts. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll update this more over time. I primarily use dark mode, so that&#8217;s what I currently have in there. But you could also modify the scripts to include light themes as well. Here&#8217;s my <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1Jn">Modules action group</a> as it stands today for you to play with and make your own. You&#8217;ll need to change the theme names in each of the module actions, else you might get an error.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t quite yet cracked the switching of syntaxes based on themes. I have, however, leveraged Matt Gemmell&#8217;s previous Switch Syntax action and <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1jz">created my own</a> which provides a list of all the installed syntaxes. It&#8217;s not automated, but it does the job when I need it. I&#8217;m sure Rosemary is working on something even more clever…</p>
<h3>Automated Journaling</h3>
<p>On the show, we talked about some of the automations I&#8217;ve used (in most cases, continued to use) frequently. One of my journal shortcuts saves the text of the journal as a PDF for future reading. That&#8217;s when David brought up a great suggestion: using a Shortcuts automation at a specific time to automatically save the journal at night so I don&#8217;t have to do it manually.</p>
<p>It took a few modifications to my original shortcut, but I have the automatic saving of journal entries figured out. The <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4d686cd67ae440448d3e0469080db9d9">Journal • Save</a> shortcut searches my Journal workspace for today&#8217;s journal entry, gets the content of the draft, creates an entry title (formatted <code>Journal Entry yyyy-MM-dd</code>), creates a nicely-formatted PDF, and saves the PDF version to <code>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/Journal/</code>.<sup id="fnref-2049-bug"><a href="#fn-2049-bug" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> I manually move these once a week during my weekly review for now, until the Shortcuts team actually gives me that built in feature.<sup id="fnref-2049-tried"><a href="#fn-2049-tried" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup> This action can be used with Shortcuts automation; if you choose to run the automation without asking, it will run automatically in the background. I have mine set to run at 11:00 pm every day, and in my testing since we recorded, it&#8217;s been working fantastically.</p>
<p>This then lead me to <strong><em>change</em></strong> the way I&#8217;ve been journaling, so that I can just automate the creation of the journal entry and never miss a day. The old way of starting my journal is answering a couple of questions: did I wear my watch to sleep to get data out of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">AutoSleep</a> – a feature that is broken due to an iOS 14.5 bug  – and how did I feel when I woke up. Here&#8217;s a secret: I&#8217;m not sure I sleep all that well generally, I never use the quantifiable data in any meaningful way, and I don&#8217;t know that I need a reminder of how shitty all that can be and make me feel. If I want a pretty chart or other meaningful insights, I&#8217;d be better off going into AutoSleep or the Health app to get it. Weighing the importance of sleep tracking vs daily journaling, having a journal entry for every day that is just automatically there just makes more sense. Using the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0e033f7bbf0f465da352e8b0268c17a4">Journal • Start</a> shortcut in conjunction with another Shortcuts automation which runs at 6:00am, and automatically starts a journal entry for me without any interaction on my part.<sup id="fnref-2049-forecast"><a href="#fn-2049-forecast" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running this for the week, and it&#8217;s been really great so far. Removing the friction of interacting every time I want to start and save a journal entry has made me want to journal more. Sometimes, it&#8217;s those little things that get you change your mind. I&#8217;m calling this a win.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks again David and Rosemary for having me on, and for the idea to be a better Automator!</p>

I am having a shortcuts bug where the file from Shortcuts gets created with a <code>-2</code> suffix, which is hyper annoying. I have to manually fix them. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s something I could solve with a script, but I haven&#8217;t had the time. It&#8217;s a bug, and the Shortcuts team works it out. Additionally, I would like to have the ability in Shortcuts to save the entries to the Journal location I keep in iCloud Drive. Would make life a lot simpler.&#160;<a href="#fnref-2049-bug">&#8617;</a>

I tried to use a script in Scriptable to move the files from the Shortcuts folder to my preferred journal location in iCloud Drive, but it often took a while to run. I can quickly move the files once a week, so I&#8217;m not too worried about it. Maybe a future update of my journal workflow will happen if features come to iOS 15.&#160;<a href="#fnref-2049-tried">&#8617;</a>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m often asked what different uses I have for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-5-capture-act/id1236254471?at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a>, my everything-text app of choice. I have a variety of core use cases which I use Drafts for every day: even with my <a href="https://nahumck.me/?s=Drafts">posts</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/">large</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/">reviews</a>, journaling is by far the highest volume of content I create.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve journaled for a while. And while I&#8217;m not perfect at doing it and frequently miss days because life sometimes gets in the way, there are some considerations I&#8217;ve made for my particular journaling solution. A few years ago, I <a href="https://nahumck.me/rolling-your-own/">created my own journal solution</a>: this utilized Drafts + Dropbox + Workflow. That solution morphed into using <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id395722470?at=1001l4VZ">DEVONthink To Go</a> to save the journal entries, primarily because of security. I was also storing more information there at the time, so it made sense.</p>
<p>Then, in the midst of a pandemic, I started looking at a lot of the things in my life that were just adding to my least favorite thing: clutter. I started wondering where DEVONthink fit into my life. And aside from keeping the rare thing or two in it, I only used it for journaling. So while this solution worked – and worked well – it started to become apparent to me that I no longer wanted this as the solution.</p>
<p>Inevitably, as often these ear worms do, it sent me down a new path. How could I take my journaling solution and simplify it to use the apps and services I want to use so that I can streamline my process, or at the very least, make it easier to use and review later?<br />
<span id="more-1866"></span><br />
<em>Just use a dedicated app</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been down this road. In the past, I used a dedicated journaling app. And while it was good at what it did, there were aspects that didn&#8217;t appeal to me: security breaches and a subscription price isn&#8217;t worth it for me.<sup id="fnref-1866-subscription"><a href="#fn-1866-subscription" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> I can roll my own solution here utilizing apps I already have, and save myself the cost. And, for the most part, I&#8217;m not missing a lot from some of the full-featured apps.</p>
<p>Another reason for not doing this is that most use their own syncing solution, which has me uncomfortable. I like to control where my data is going. I trust Apple more than most, even if it&#8217;s not a fully secure thing.<sup id="fnref-1866-really"><a href="#fn-1866-really" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> Having that control feels right to me, and having my data stored in iCloud Drive will be better for me in the long run anyway.</p>
<p>Moving from Dropbox to iCloud Drive has allowed me to purge my subscription to Dropbox entirely, and I increased my 200GB iCloud Drive plan to 1TB. Now I pay far less for the same storage I was using. I still have my Dropbox account and still use the 7GB free that I have, but I don&#8217;t use it in the same way; it is for shared or temporary files. I don&#8217;t need to have DEVONthink installed, thus clearing up some clutter from my life.</p>
<p><em>So, now on to how I threw this together…</em></p>
<p>I start my journal by tapping a shortcut in the widget or tapping the shortcut notification, which in turn kicks of an automation; the automation actually calls the shortcut, so the process of them is the same, but how I get there can be different.<sup id="fnref-1866-fails"><a href="#fn-1866-fails" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup> This shortcut asks me a few questions, all of which can be run in the widget and is my preferred method, to start off my journal. From there, it adds my sleep duration and resting heart rate, along with aspects of the weather forecast for the day, all formatted how I like them.</p>
<p>All of that text goes into Drafts, along with the proper tags to make sure it gets into my Journal workspace. This is where all of my thoughts go. I have it broken into a couple of categories: quick hits and entries.<sup id="fnref-1866-podcast"><a href="#fn-1866-podcast" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup> Quick hits are just that: quick little thoughts. I found that adding quick hits has allowed me to just write instead of feeling like I need to say anything profound. Just gets it out of my head and on to the pa… screen. Entries are for more long-form writing. I don&#8217;t do them every day, but when I do, I like to make sure I know what time of the day I was writing it. Over time, I&#8217;ve even seen patterns just knowing the time of day I was writing, which has been interesting.</p>
<p>For entries or even quick hits, I have several shortcuts which can add data to my journal: weather, location, health, and music. Each of those adds pertinent data to my entries at any given time; they start in Drafts, kick over to Shortcuts, gets the data back, and sends a block of text back into my journal entry. For the health shortcut, it needs to be run from the phone. It is also limited to move ring numbers, as exercise minutes and stand hours aren&#8217;t available via Shortcuts right now. My hope was to recreate activity rings, but I&#8217;ll wait on that until more support come to both the Shortcuts and Health apps.</p>
<p>Along with the data, I can add a few other file types that might be relevant for me: audio recordings, photos, and files. These don&#8217;t save the files into Drafts, which does not support them, but rather provides Markdown-formatted links to the files for use later. I occasionally will do an audio file to capture something that&#8217;s more nuanced than text. Similarly, I might need to reference a file later and having the option here helps as well. It may seem weird that I have files linked to a journal, but, well… it&#8217;s <em>my</em> journal.</p>

<p>Now that I have everything in place, rather than save the text, I realized I just want to be able to view the final product after it&#8217;s completed for the day. For a while, I was saving plain text and viewing it later via a quick look action, but I ultimately just want the rendered journal entry. This sent me down the path to creating a way to save a PDF of the document, along with rendered images and links to the audio recordings and files for later consumption.</p>
<p>This might sound complex, but what it forced me to do was focus on what I really wanted to ever put in a journal, and develop those solutions. Now that they are there, assuming Drafts, Shortcuts, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?at=1001l4VZ">Scriptable</a> don&#8217;t go away, I&#8217;ll be able to have this solution for a long time. In fact, if improvements come to Shortcuts which provide certain features, I might not even need all three to make this happen.<sup id="fnref-1866-room"><a href="#fn-1866-room" class="jetpack-footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The trickiest part of all of this was saving the photos, files, recordings, and the final PDF where I wanted them to go. This is where Scriptable comes in. Scriptable provides the ability to create File Bookmarks, something highlighted by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/viticci/">Federico</a> in his <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/fs-bookmarks-a-shortcut-to-reopen-files-and-folders-directly-in-the-files-app/">FS Bookmarks post</a>. In simple terms, the File Bookmark enables me to have saved locations to send data into. Scriptable is able to manipulate files in a way that Shortcuts simply can&#8217;t: if I want to move a file from one location in iCloud Drive to another, I can&#8217;t do that natively in Shortcuts. But with a little JavaScript and some help,<sup id="fnref-1866-Rosemary"><a href="#fn-1866-Rosemary" class="jetpack-footnote">6</a></sup> I&#8217;m able to do just that.</p>
<p>For each one of the different document types – photos, recordings, files, and entries – I have a file bookmark to a folder. They all run generally in the same way, with some exceptions in each. The main point of all of these was I could save them into the <code>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/</code> folder in an automated way, but would have to manually select where to put it if I wanted the file anywhere else. This is less than ideal from an automation perspective. It can be done, but if there&#8217;s a way to automate it, I&#8217;d much rather.</p>
<p>So for each of the shortcuts outlined below, I have a script in Scriptable which is basically the following:</p>
<pre><code>let filePath = args.fileURLs[0];
let fm = FileManager.iCloud()
let destinationPath = fm.bookmarkedPath('Path'); //change this to your bookmarked folder in Scriptable
let fileName = fm.fileName(filePath) + '.' + fm.fileExtension(filePath);
fm.move(filePath, destinationPath + '/' + fileName)
</code></pre>
<p>As you see in the comment within the script, you need to change the <code>'Path'</code> to whatever your file bookmark is called. For my journal entries, I simply have it named <code>'Journal'</code>. For each one of the file types I have a journal bookmark for where they need to end up. I also have a separate scriptable action which is incorporated into the shortcuts I use. With all of these in place, I can start to send the different files where I need them to go automatically.</p>
<p>Each shortcut is essentially the same: it asks me to select a file, rename the file, and then saves it into a Shortcuts folder. Then, I&#8217;m kicked over to Scriptable to move the file from one place to another. Upon return, they each produce a link to the file type. While moving out of Shortcuts into Scriptable and back again isn&#8217;t ideal, it does work; my hope is that in the future, I won&#8217;t have to do this song-and-dance maneuver.</p>
<p>For audio recordings and files, I&#8217;ve taken the prefix of the launcher shortcut and just appended the file name and folder location manually:</p>
<p><code>shareddocuments:///private/var/mobile/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Personal/Journal/</code></p>
<p>This works extremely well and means I don&#8217;t have to create a file bookmark for every file. Photos, however, uses something else. At the time of me writing this, I cannot figure out a way to have renderable links for photos within Files. I&#8217;ve tried everything I can think of, but nothing has worked. I could use my website and upload images, but I only need them on a temporary basis. This is where Dropbox comes in. I save the image file to Dropbox in a temp folder, get the link to the file, and insert a Markdown image link <code>![name](url)</code>; I had to make sure to replace the <code>www</code> with <code>dl</code> to make it render, but it works very well. Every so often, I have a shortcut that I can tap and remove all of the temporary images from the folder. I don&#8217;t actually need to keep the images here: because they are rendered and a part of the PDF, they are ephemeral files for me. If I ever want to review the image, I can just pop into my photo library, search on the date, and then get the file.</p>
<p>To save my entires, I have a shortcut that is kicked off from Drafts. It accepts the Markdown-formatted text from Drafts, converts it to HTML, and then uses a customized HTML formatting I created to generate a PDF. Once I view the PDF and hit &#8216;OK&#8217; to proceed, the PDF is then saved to iCloud Drive in the Shortcuts folder; from there, I&#8217;m sent over to Scriptable where the script moves it from the folder to the Journal bookmarked folder, similar to how I do with the other files.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re wanting to see these actions. But, I&#8217;m not sharing them right now. Not because I&#8217;m trying to be mean and withhold them, but they change very frequently; I&#8217;m tweaking them so often that during the time I started writing to the time I&#8217;m going to hit publish on this post, it will have changed no less than 4 times.<sup id="fnref-1866-nine"><a href="#fn-1866-nine" class="jetpack-footnote">7</a></sup> These actions are pretty simple to create, aside from the JavaScript I already shared. The image below will help guide you through some of the Shortcuts. I&#8217;m thinking about sharing them at some point,<sup id="fnref-1866-newsletter"><a href="#fn-1866-newsletter" class="jetpack-footnote">8</a></sup> but for now you&#8217;ll just have to steal inspiration and create them yourself.</p>

<p>Compared to what I originally started with and even my &#8220;upgraded&#8221; solution along the way, this new solution is so much better for me and the way I want to keep my journal. I&#8217;m even going back through my journal entries, fixing some image and file links, and will be saving those out as a PDF as well.</p>
<p>In the future, I hope that I can do a couple of things to improve all of it: move the files within Shortcuts actions itself, and render images using iCloud Drive rather than using Dropbox. If I can streamline this workflow to be Drafts + Shortcuts – two apps that will be around for a long time – I&#8217;d much prefer it. And while I don&#8217;t mind supporting another indie developer right now, I would love to reduce the digital clutter in my life even more.</p>
<p>The end result of this has paid off for me: I&#8217;ve built a complete journaling system over time, built on the foundation of common formats and apps I use on a daily basis, to create the best system for me. As with a lot of things surrounding Drafts and the way I work, I can see this workflow sticking for a long time. It&#8217;s evolved from a text based solution to a PDF solution. The PDF format has been around for ages, and I don&#8217;t see that going away for a while. It will allow me to keep a lot of the historical record intact for at least my lifetime. Will I ever share it with anyone? Probably not. But I can rest easy that if I really wanted to do it, I now have the ability to do so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, I was reminded of a post that I remembered being great, but at the time was aspirational to me. And it shouldn&#39;t surprise you that it came from <a href="http://sethclifford.me/2016/03/leaving-the-nest/" title="Greetings from the Grid - Leaving the Nest">Seth</a>. With this post brought back into the forefront of my mind, it got me thinking about what I&#39;m doing, and how I&#39;m ultimately failing at a lot of things right now.</p>
<p>There are some things that I really need to spend some time on: my physical self, my mental self, my family, my home, my job, my <a href="http://podcast.fundamentallybroken.men" title="Fundamentally Broken">podcast</a>. And the list could go on. But you get the point.</p>
<p>One of the things that I love to do but don&#39;t really have the time to do is read. And with the complexity of my life not letting up, I need to get a better handle on life. Part of doing so is removing some of the distraction that I have, and that starts on my personal device.<br />
<span id="more-1052"></span><br />
I&#39;m going to be making a few changes until I get my house in order, so-to-speak. First, I&#39;m going to remove all of the Twitter apps from my phone. Then, I&#39;m going to set up email alerts for mentions and DMs. I&#39;ll still be active in the various <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-business-communication-for-teams/id618783545?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ" title="Slack">Slack</a> channels, where I have a lot of fantastic conversation without the politics, hate crimes, and other bullshit that can be seen.<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> If I want to see horrible things in life, I&#39;ll look at Google or Apple News.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t in retaliation to anything about Twitter nor the people on it: it&#39;s still a decent platform for social engagement if you do it correctly. I&#39;ll still be using it for the podcast when we announce new episodes, and anything I post will also automatically get posted.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m attempting to do is minimize my distractions, focus on what I need to get done, and get back on top of my life, and hopefully be more productive.<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> This will be one less thing I idly read, which can be devoted to other, <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/book/getting-things-done/id888011802?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ" title="Getting Things Done">more important texts</a>. I&#39;m hoping this will spark some creative thoughts along the way, and some introspection that will lead to some good <a href="https://nahumck.me/rolling-your-own/" title="Rolling Your Own - nahumck.me">journaling</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also wanting this to kickstart my time for other aspects of life. I&#39;m going to devote time to healthy eating, living, fitness, and relaxation in the form of meditation and yoga. I might use some apps along the way to help me, which would be a far better use of my time than thumbing through a feed. And maybe, just maybe — I can be a better husband, father, family member, and friend.</p>
<p>No matter what, I know this will lead to some good things, even if this feels a bit scary. But now that it&#39;s out there, I can&#39;t take it back. Onward.</p>
<ol id="footnotes">
<li id="fn1">Ok, ok… for the most part. But it&#39;s all in good fun there. <a href="#ffn1">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="fn2">As much as one can with all of the other distractions in life. <a href="#ffn2">&#8617;</a></li>
