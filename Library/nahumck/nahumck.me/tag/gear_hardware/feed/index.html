										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro is now available and starting to appear in reviews. Most of them have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNWG9KRAbCc">video</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLQAh6IHPc4&amp;t=319s">reviews</a>, but I am starting to see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/apples-magic-keyboard-review-laptop-class-typing-comes-to-ipad-pro/">written</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-a-new-breed-of-laptop/">reviews</a> as well.</p>
<p>In watching the video reviews, my early suspicion of the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro was confirmed: I won&#8217;t be getting it. Not because it&#8217;s bad, but rather it comes down to a matter of use cases for me. Sure, weight and cost are also factors, but I need to be able to actually use the device if I&#8217;m going to make this device a good fit.<br />
<span id="more-1697"></span></p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m working from home for the foreseeable future, I&#8217;m using the iPad Pro in a &#8220;docked&#8221; manner, where it sits off to the right in a stand connected to an external monitor; for input, I use the Logitech K780 keyboard and – new to my <a href="https://nahumck.me/my-home-office-studio/">home office setup</a> – a Magic Trackpad 2. In this scenario, the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro obviously wouldn&#8217;t be used, just like my Smart Keyboard Folio sits below my monitor.</p>
<p>I do use my iPad around the house in various ways: handheld, on a table or counter, or to write on. In this way, I could have the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, and just pull it off. I can simply fold the Smart Keyboard Folio around and use it my hand; I am used to the weight now, and it doesn&#8217;t bother me. I also have a Magic Mouse 2, which I use when I&#8217;m away from my home desk, which is small enough to fit in my pocket for me to carry around or use anywhere in the house. So the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro doesn&#8217;t provide me a benefit here either.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s talk about when I&#8217;m actually at work. In an office. Remember those times? Anyway, I do go from meeting to meeting in conference rooms. In these scenarios, I&#8217;m often at the table in the room where it happens. I often will switch modes depending on what I&#8217;m doing: for some meetings I&#8217;m able to use my iPad Pro in more of the laptop mode with the Smart Keyboard Folio; in others, I might be writing down notes and focusing on presentations being given. And for those times where I&#8217;m not at the table, I&#8217;m sitting off to the side where there is no place other than my lap. The Smart Keyboard Folio lends itself to all of these conditions, and affords me the opportunity to use the iPad Pro in any one of those during the course of the day. The Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro is sold in a particular way: as a keyboard, not a folio, and is for landscape orientations only. This would hinder the way in which I use the device for my day job.</p>
<p>Looking at all of those use cases together, it really is apparent to me that using my iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard Folio is <em><strong>my</strong></em> best opportunity to meet all things. I can augment the experience when docked, or I can carry around the Magic Mouse 2 when I need to be mobile. It&#8217;s not always going to be the ideal experience, but it does what I need to get the job done. Also, I already have the components I need, and don&#8217;t need to spend an additional $300 on something that would be a limited use case for me.</p>
<p>All that aside, I really love the idea of the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro. The engineering of it seems solid, and it appears to be very well built. The fact that you can charge the device using the built-in port while using another USB-C device in the other is something that I hope gets more extensible over time with software updates. I&#8217;m delighted that this device exists: this is the first generation of the device, and it will only get better with feedback and iteration.<sup id="fnref-1697-iteration"><a href="#fn-1697-iteration" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> The fact that this device exists for everyone is fantastic, so they can choose what works for them. This is what Apple excels at: creating multiple devices in given form factor/class, and providing options for users to suit on their individual needs.</p>
<p>The Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro looks to be an amazing device, but one thing is clear: this is not for me. And that&#8217;s OK.</p>

<p>For a long time, I&#8217;ve wanted my own office. For a while, I&#8217;ve had a <a href="https://nahumck.me/my-podcast-setup/">podcast space of my own</a>, but it has never been what I&#8217;ve truly wanted in a home office/podcast studio. So in this time of social distancing and staying-at-home to reduce the spread of COVID-19, I realized very quickly that my podcast area was going to be very insufficient for long-term working from home. This sent me down a path of incorporating what I currently have to what I&#8217;ve wanted for so long: a sit/stand desk.<br />
<span id="more-1654"></span></p>
<p>If you want to see where I&#8217;ve started to where I&#8217;ve ended up, I <a href="https://twitter.com/nahumck/status/1244625495062437888?s=21">posted some pictures on Twitter</a> to show the progression. It&#8217;s a massive change. The original setup was just abysmal. The middle two setup steps were ok, and really just a move from one area of the basement to the other with some upgrades. But this last one has been special for me. I&#8217;ve been able to take my time and craft a setup that works best for this space in my home.<br />
As always, the focal part of a new desk setup is, well, the desk. I&#8217;ve looked for a long time at various options for me: buying a pre-made sit/stand motorized desk, making my own table top and using a sit/stand motorized frame, or just making a standing desk with a high stool for the short periods of time I&#8217;d like to sit.</p>
<p>Frustrated at the prospect of spending $600 on just the desk, I took a walk to clear my head. During the walk, I kept thinking &#8220;sit/stand&#8221; and tried to get at the root of what I wanted. I wanted something I could change frequently. I wanted to move from one level to another for comfort. I wanted something <em>adjustable</em>. So when I return from my walk and typed &#8220;adjustable desk&#8221; into Amazon, a bunch of different opportunities presented themselves. And that&#8217;s when I saw what I wanted – the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-62-in-Adjustable-Height-Work-Table-HOLT62XDB12/301810799">Husky 62&#8243; Adjustable Height Work Table</a>.<sup id="fnref-1654-homedepot"><a href="#fn-1654-homedepot" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is really an adjustable workbench, primarily used for garages. But there&#8217;s no reason I can&#8217;t use this; and, at $300 total shipped to my door, it&#8217;s half the cost of the other desks I was considering. It has the same depth as my old desk, but it&#8217;s 14&#8243; wider than my previous one. The extra room gives me the space to both my laptop and my iPad Pro up at the same time on either side of my monitor, effectively having three screens if I need to do it. It&#8217;s plenty of space to include other things like my bluetooth speaker, my Yeti mug, a giant <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Cmhoo-Professional-Large-Computer-35-4x15-7x0-1IN/dp/B01F0XHA5E">mouse pad</a>, and a <a href="https://amzn.to/33YzRbj">midi keyboard</a>.<sup id="fnref-1654-midi"><a href="#fn-1654-midi" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The other nice part of having an adjustable desk is that I already had an <a href="https://amzn.to/2UR3qaI">anti-fatigue mat</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/39uHBD2">balance ball chair</a> to use with it. I adjust the desk maybe two times in a day, so the manual adjustment isn&#8217;t that big a deal. When I need to stand, the chair goes behind me to the side and the mat is placed on the floor; when I need to sit, I pick the mat up and put it to the side of the desk against the wall, and move my chair in position. If I needed to do this more frequently, I&#8217;d be doing something different. But this is more than fine for my needs, and I&#8217;m following the <a href="https://www.startstanding.org/proper-workplace-ergonomics/">ergonomic guidelines</a> I&#8217;ve found.<br />
So with the adjustable desk and comfort taken care of, I focused on the top of my desk. First, this all centers around my monitor: it&#8217;s a 31.5&#8243; Dell 1080p monitor with a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Logitech-Laptop-Webcam-Design-360-Degree/dp/B004YW7WCY">Logitech webcam</a> on top. It&#8217;s not 4K but it does the job.<sup id="fnref-1654-upgrade"><a href="#fn-1654-upgrade" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup> I needed it to be slightly higher up for the setup, so I purchased a <a href="https://amzn.to/3dl6V1z">monitor stand</a> to raise it up the appropriate amount. I picked this one for a few reasons: it looks clean, has flexibility with the shape and width, and had some hidden features within it. I have a small stand for my work iPhone as well as a drawer/stand for my personal iPhone. I can also store some small items in the drawer. Surprisingly, the 11&#8243; iPad Pro Smart Keyboard Folio fits perfectly underneath in the way I have it configured.</p>

<p>In front of the monitor sits my keyboard, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2V2DkBX">Logitech K780 keyboard</a>. I picked this up before the <a href="https://amzn.to/2X4P8WJ">Logitech MX Keys</a> was released, which I would recommend picking up over the K780. And next to that, I have the Magic Mouse 2; this is mainly used for my iPad Pro, which is primarily to the right of my monitor sitting in my <a href="https://amzn.to/2wMcENq">iPad stand</a>. This is plugged into the monitor via HDMI and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2G1f388">HyperDrive USB-C Hub 6-in-1 Adapter</a>. Eventually, I would like to get a Magic Trackpad 2 for my setup, and use the Magic Mouse 2 for travel.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re thinking: do you have a Mac? Well, I do have a late-2012 Mac mini, but it&#8217;s pretty much invisible in the picture. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s attached to the Vesa mount holes on my monitor in a <a href="https://amzn.to/2R8q5hX">HIDEit Mount</a>. I&#8217;ve done my best with some velcro straps to keep the cables as invisible as possible throughout the desk, and this was no small feat. But this is working very well so far. I have an <a href="https://amzn.to/39Ia08S">HDMI switch</a> also mounted to the back of the monitor via some trusty 3M Velcro Command Strips, which are a big enabler for cable management. I do use the Mac, albeit rarely; most times it acts as a nice mass damper on the back of the monitor. Perhaps one day I will upgrade it, but for now, it&#8217;s back there when I need it for the singular task of uploading an MP3.</p>

<p>To the left of the monitor sits my mic: this is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2ylTz5l">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB microphone</a> in a <a href="https://amzn.to/2UTk9dM">microphone shock mount</a> which has a metal pop filter, mounted to the desk via a <a href="https://amzn.to/2QKLT2O">Knox Gear 38&#8243; Microphone Stand</a>. I absolutely love the boom arm: it&#8217;s well made, feels solid and fluid in it&#8217;s movement, and is long enough to extend the microphone to the center of the desk from the corner. When I&#8217;m not podcasting,<sup id="fnref-1654-beenawhile"><a href="#fn-1654-beenawhile" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup> it can be moved out of the way.</p>
<p>On the under side of my desk, I have the Elevation Labs <a href="https://amzn.to/3aHdPMV">Anchor</a> for <a href="https://amzn.to/2JyAAXl">my headphones</a> on the left, and the <a href="https://amzn.to/2xO7CAs">Shelf</a> for some odds &amp; sods on the right. I liked these options as they stick to the bottom of the desk, and they aren&#8217;t holding heavy items. In addition to those items, I also have a power strip along with an <a href="https://amzn.to/2UDOzl1">Anker 5-port wall charger</a> mounted to the bottom to keep things nice and tidy. On the back side of the desk, multiple command strips keep the cords running out of sight as well. On the right side, I also have a magnetic flashlight attached along with a hook for my <a href="https://nahumck.me/the-ios-only-podcasting-kit/">iOS Podcasting Kit</a>.</p>

<p>With all the bits of my desk figured out, I needed to make sure I had some decent soundproofing. For a long time, I had some foam in my setup. And while that&#8217;s good, and looks good, the walls around where I have my desk have had some holes put in them over time when mounting different items, and I&#8217;d have to cover the entire wall. I started doing some research and spoke to a few people on the most effective yet most inexpensive options. And I ended up going to something I&#8217;ve said before: <em>use what&#8217;s around you if you can</em>. I had the blanket I had used previously to dampen sound from the metallic desk worked, and it worked perfectly for the backdrop. Then I added two <a href="https://amzn.to/2WUp6Fv">moving blankets</a> on either side because I wanted it to be as uniform as possible; for the left side, I made a simple triangle out of some wood, and attached that to the wall to create a false wall out of the blanket. I hung all of the blankets using some screws and some washers.</p>

<p>While this doesn&#8217;t look as &#8220;professional&#8221; as others with acoustic foam, it actually works better for my situation. I didn&#8217;t have to spend money to fix the wall, and it looks good enough that I can share it without feeling some shame. To cap it off, I have a decent-looking <a href="https://amzn.to/2wfVBTW">room divider</a>; in the future, I plan on getting a second, and also attaching some thin sound barrier to the back side of both; this will help with the sound behind me during recordings, but is easy enough to get out of the way. About my only gripe with this setup is that I&#8217;m in the basement, but that&#8217;s nothing that a <a href="https://amzn.to/3aFPF5z">happy light</a> couldn&#8217;t fix.</p>

<p>I am overjoyed with how this has turned out. I had to put in a bit of money (around $400 total) to make it this way, and I was able to use all of the other items I&#8217;ve collected over time. However, the sum total is less than what a typical sit/stand desk could cost me, and that makes me smile. With the flexibility that the desk affords me has helped me mentally focus on work and writing, it has been invaluable to me. I <em>feel</em> more professional now, or really, more like an adult who has their own place. Maybe not quite an adult, but at least a man-child with some new <a href="https://amzn.to/33VERh3">toys</a>.</p>
<p>This setup is tailor made for me and my iPad-first lifestyle. I&#8217;ve been using the iPad Pro over the past few years as my main computer, and even at this time from home, I&#8217;ve been using it for both work and home as well. There are very few times I&#8217;m reaching for my work laptop. Most everything can be done now for me on an iPad. And with this setup, I can use it as an iPad and the pencil flat on my desk; I can type on my keyboard with the iPad on a stand; or I can turn it into a docking station and use my keyboard &amp; mouse to navigate it fully. It really feels like the modern computer I&#8217;ve wanted, and we are only at the start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve added and removed multiple things from a travel kit. When I got my <a href="https://nahumck.me/tactical-bag/">tactical bag</a>, I started to think of minimal carry. In fact, it&#8217;s starting to bleed into my regular life as well. But that&#8217;s a post for another time.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, I started thinking of an all-USB-C charging setup. I&#8217;ve had other power bricks and cables, but as I move towards devices which can accept more from higher-output chargers, the idea of using USB-C only is really appealing. My iPad Pro 11&#8243; and iPhone Xs are both capable of faster charging speeds, which is really why I started my journey.<br />
<span id="more-1647"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing for my regular travel setup. And by travel, I mean trips, back and forth to work, etc. Keep in mind that I (barely) use a PC for my day job, and I don&#8217;t carry a MacBook of any kind. This setup is really for my 4 devices: iPad Pro 11&#8243;, now with a <a href="https://amzn.to/37GYolO">Cover Buddy case</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/32aG8jy">Moshi iVisor AG screen protector</a>, and the Smart Keyboard Folio; iPhone Xs; Apple Watch Series 4; and <a href="https://amzn.to/30uk2aR">AirPods Pro</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/nahumck/status/1211460824533000193">modified</a> <a href="https://amzn.to/3ajFFiz">foam tips</a> for extra comfort. I&#8217;m not always charging these devices at the same time. In fact, I&#8217;m normally charging my Apple Watch before bed, and my iPhone and iPad Pro overnight. At most, I would need 3 USB-C ports to charge. At the time of me writing this, there are zero options for a 3-port single charger, but it&#8217;s something I hope comes in the future.</p>

<p>The main source of power in my setup is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2R46M9D">AUKEY 63W PD wall charger with dual USB-C ports</a>. This is about the same size as my previous wall charger, but with a <em>lot</em> more power. The top port is an 18W PD port, and the bottom is a 60W PD port<sup id="fnref-1647-port"><a href="#fn-1647-port" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> meant more for a MacBook than an iPad. But, thanks to the technology in the iPad Pro, it can accept the maximum charging and quickly power the device.</p>
<p>For the cables, I have a single <a href="https://amzn.to/30warjD">6&#8242; Anker USB-C to USB-C cable</a> cable to power my iPad Pro and my <a href="https://amzn.to/2RreHNj">AUKEY PD Power Bank 10000mAh</a>. There are no dual USB-C battery packs available right now that I can find; but when the technology is there, I&#8217;ll replace this with a 2-port USB-C battery pack with double the capacity; that way I can charge both the iPhone and iPad to 100%. For the AirPods Pro and my iPhones, I use the 1m USB-C to Lightning cable which came with the AirPods Pro, along with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2TA8PnQ">6&#8242; Anker USB-C to Lightning cable</a>. I travel with 2 iPhones, one for work and one for travel, and might need to charge both at any given time. And given that my day job requires road trips in vehicles for testing, I recently purchased a <a href="https://amzn.to/38rUspR">Anker 2-Port USB-C Car Charger</a> to dual charge devices at 18W each; this has proven very useful on the road. I also carry my <a href="https://amzn.to/2G1f388">HyperDrive USB-C Hub 6-in-1 Adapter</a><sup id="fnref-1647-removed"><a href="#fn-1647-removed" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> along with a <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rxy9rD">USB-A male to USB-C female adapter</a>, which does allow me to utilize either the HyperDrive&#8217;s USB-A port or a port in the car when I&#8217;m testing and want to use CarPlay.<sup id="fnref-1647-fornow"><a href="#fn-1647-fornow" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>To facilitate the watch charging during travel, I was faced with a couple of options: keep the watch charger I have and bring another charing brick with me, buy a USB-C version of the watch charger, or try something new. I voted for the last option, and I picked up a <a href="https://amzn.to/30sTIOk">Satechi USB-C Apple Watch Charger</a>. This device plugs into my iPad Pro while I&#8217;m winding down for the day, pulling from the battery of the iPad itself. If I find that my iPad Pro is too low on power, I can simply plug this directly into the small <a href="https://amzn.to/2V0pIZy">Aukey 18W USB-C wall charger</a> I carry; it&#8217;s a little bigger than a standard iPhone 5W charging brick, but delivers 18W of power over USB-C and has a folding plug. It is a small device, which is great for travel, but I will need to be mindful about where I might leave it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been enjoying this setup. It&#8217;s not quite the ideal setup that I&#8217;m looking to achieve – a future where I have a 3-port USB wall charger and a 2-port USB-C battery pack – but it&#8217;s what I have available now. With this setup, it&#8217;s compact and fairly light, and I have charging for all of my devices no matter what the scenario. As the future moves forward to USB-C for everything, I feel like I&#8217;m ready to embrace that future, and not much on my end will need to change. Being ahead of the game isn&#8217;t a bad thing.</p>

<li id="fn-1647-port">
The 60W charging is if nothing else is plugged in. If another device is plugged in, it&#8217;s 18W PD for the top port and 45W PD for the bottom port. In my specific use case, this is more than enough for what I need.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1647-port">&#8617;</a>

I did completely remove the two pieces that come with it so that it can sit flush with the Cover Buddy case installed. It works just fine, and might actually be a bit more stable this way. But it&#8217;s something to keep in mind.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1647-removed">&#8617;</a>

<p>When I purchased iPad Pro 11&#8243;, I immediately bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZYSTNR/?tag=nahumck-20">Smart Keyboard Folio</a> (SKF, as I refer to it).<sup id="fnref-1622-first"><a href="#fn-1622-first" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> At the time, this was the best – and only – keyboard option made specifically for the iPad Pro. I needed something that wasn&#8217;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&#8217;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTSF94C/?tag=nahumck-20">11&#8243; Brydge Pro keyboard</a> review unit to try out.<br />
<span id="more-1622"></span></p>
<p>The unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&#8217;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&#8217;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&#8217;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off. When you use it in tablet mode – the mode where you can write on it with the pencil – it does prevent it from folding fully flat; you&#8217;ll have to set it off to the side to use it in that way. There&#8217;s just no room for the back panel in that device sandwich. It just feels odd to throw that to the side when you want to use it in this way.</p>

<p>The keyboard itself is a Bluetooth keyboard, and utilizes a USB-C cable to charge. You can even charge the keyboard from your iPad Pro if you&#8217;re running out of power. Out of the box, the keyboard had about 78% power, which was great to get me started. It took about 5 days for the battery to run down to where I wanted to charge it again, likely due to the backlit keys. I have found that if you&#8217;re doing a lot of typing with the keyboard lit, you&#8217;re going to drain it a lot faster.</p>
<p>Having the battery in the keyboard means it was going to be heavy compared to the SKF, which brings me to the first thing I immediately noticed about the Brydge Pro keyboard: this thing is <em>heavy</em>. Not just a little, but a lot. At 700 grams for the keyboard and the protective cover, it more than doubles the weight of the iPad Pro<sup id="fnref-1622-weight"><a href="#fn-1622-weight" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> carry in my bag; compare that to the SKF, which clocks in at just 302 grams, and it&#8217;s clear to see that you need to be very comfortable with the extra weight if you&#8217;re going to carry this around. It may not seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s significant. The extra weight is great for when you&#8217;re using it in your lap, however, like when you&#8217;re on a couch or as I did in a car while on a road trip; the SKF tends to be more top-heavy,<sup id="fnref-1622-heavy"><a href="#fn-1622-heavy" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup> and doesn&#8217;t feel as stable in those instances whereas the Brydge felt solid.</p>
<p>The next thing I noticed: the keyboard is a bit narrower than the SKF. Being that this is the 11&#8243; model, that width can take some getting used to. But I was able to adapt over the first several days. The placement of the Siri key is also a bit difficult with the layout, as my finger often presses is when I&#8217;m attempting to use the control key. Again, this layout just takes some getting use to and is not insurmountable; I&#8217;m even trying to utilize Siri more now with this key, using the Type to Siri accessibility feature, and the availability of such a key is welcome. Having the media keys above the row is great. I really wish that Apple would figure out how to make this happen. I&#8217;ve suggested a couple of different ways before, but I doubt they&#8217;d ever consider it.<sup id="fnref-1622-idea"><a href="#fn-1622-idea" class="jetpack-footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>My review unit did have a couple of issues: I noticed that the lettering on the keys weren&#8217;t straight. I notice these sorts of things all the time as part of my day job, so it was immediately apparent to me. It&#8217;s not a deal breaker by any means, and my hope is that it is because this is an early review unit. The main issue that I did have with the keyboard has been the missed keystrokes. It&#8217;s not all the time, but when it does happen, it takes me out of my writing focus. I reached out to the team at Brydge to let them know, and not only did they quickly respond acknowledging my concern while assuring me that this is not normal and they wanted to inspect the unit to see what was going on, but they also shipped me a new one the day after. Issues can happen in products from time to time, and even though this appears to be an isolated incident, the quick customer service experience and the fact that Brydge stand by their products is fantastic. The second unit I used did not have this issue, and most of my missed keystrokes were due to the more narrow keyboard or my lack of force to activate the key travel.</p>
<p>Overall, I really like the Brydge Pro keyboard. The keys feel very good, the infinite angles and better lap capability are very versatile, and it really does make this combination of Brydge keyboard and iPad Pro feel like a traditional laptop. But I also couldn&#8217;t help but notice that this might not be the best keyboard for me for the way I do work. In my day job, I&#8217;m often moving between typing and notetaking with the Apple Pencil, and the Brydge is more cumbersome for that particular way of working. I can lay it fully flat, but that doesn&#8217;t work as well sitting on my lap.</p>
<p>At the end of my time with the review unit, I came away mixed: it&#8217;s not as flexible for my style of working, but it&#8217;s a really fantastic option for the iPad Pro. I&#8217;m likely keeping my iPad Pro for a few more years, so having this option in addition to the Smart Keyboard Folio and the Smart Folio (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H88J5GS/?tag=nahumck-20">knockoff</a>) is the trifecta, and something I&#8217;m excited to add to my kit portfolio. I might, however, wait a bit before I buy this: with iPadOS 13 and the addition of an accessibility feature which provides cursor support, I can&#8217;t help but think that Brydge might be working on a trackpad edition, similar to the version they have for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GJ92LX/?tag=nahumck-20">Surface Pro</a>. If this existed, I wouldn&#8217;t have to carry an extra piece of kit in my bag. If they added that feature, it would push me over the edge for sure. But if you&#8217;re in the market for a laptop-like keyboard, I cannot recommend this one enough.</p>

I actually bought the Smart Folio (SF) before this, but immediately returned it after 30 min because I realized that my use cases needed the SKF.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1622-first">&#8617;</a>

My idea: turn the &#8220;globe&#8221; key in the bottom left of the keyboard with a &#8220;FN&#8221; key. Add the media functions to the number keys in the same way. This would also allow for the addition of a hard-key Siri button if you press and held the combination for a home button. Again, this is <em>a</em> way to solve it, and certainly not the way I envision Apple would do it. But I really wouldn&#8217;t mind it being there.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1622-idea">&#8617;</a>
