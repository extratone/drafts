            "content_html": "<p>Recently, I created a shortcut for the Club MacStories Discord as part of the Automation Academy. If you&#8217;re not a <a href=\"https://club.macstories.net/\">member</a>, I highly recommend doing so. This shortcut was in response to the latest lesson, all about Reminders. I&#8217;ve been meaning to create this for a while, and it seemed like a good idea to apply this lesson in practice.</p>\n<p>From the Discord:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I&#8217;ve been using packing lists in Drafts for a long time. Once it is created in Drafts, I send a single task over to Reminders with a link back to the packing list. This has worked well for years, but when I read the piece by Federico, I thought that maybe it&#8217;d be a good idea to make a customizable, variable shortcut for a packing list in Reminders instead.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I do appreciate this shortcut, as it creates reminders with subtasks in a packing list. Unfortunately, there are three things I do not like about it after using it for a short while: first, I cannot create a new list for each trip I without manual interaction; second, it clutters up my system with a lot of new tasks; third, it takes longer than I&#8217;d like to run. Now, that last point is a complete nitpick, but the first is critically important. There has been more than one occasion where I have needed to pack for work trip and then a subsequent personal trip. Having two lists to separate them is more ideal for me.</p>\n<p>I started thinking about how I could better use <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&#038;uo=4&#038;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts</a> to manage all of this. I have had a <a href=\"https://nahumck.me/making-2do-lists-better/\">single packing list</a> action for a long time. My biggest complaint about using this method is that it wasn&#8217;t variable for the type of trip I was taking. I&#8217;d run the action to create the same list over and over, then have to remove items that weren&#8217;t applicable to that particular trip. That kind of solution works, but is far less elegant. Having just gone through the shortcut activity, I couldn&#8217;t help but think that there was a better solution for me: cleaner appearance in Reminders and faster automation with Drafts.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2168\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2168\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2168\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/flexible-packing-list/packing-lists-in-drafts-vs-shortcuts/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?fit=2973%2C2288&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2973,2288\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Packing Lists in Drafts vs Shortcuts\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Managing a workspace is easier than a complex dictionary with arrays and items.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?fit=450%2C346&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?fit=1024%2C788&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?resize=1024%2C788&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"788\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2168\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?resize=1024%2C788&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?resize=450%2C346&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?resize=768%2C591&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?resize=1536%2C1182&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?resize=2048%2C1576&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?resize=1100%2C847&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Packing-Lists-in-Drafts-vs-Shortcuts.png?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2168\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Managing a workspace is easier for me than a complex dictionary with arrays and items.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>With this in mind, I created a new tag <code>packing</code>.

I&#8217;ve shared some updates through posts and social media sporadically. A lot of my current setup is visually unchanged (except the wallpaper), but I wanted to cover the <em>why</em> of the Home Screen &#8211; where apps/widgets are placed, what stacks are being used, and now I&#8217;m using them together for a more streamlined, productive setup.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1950\"></span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll state this now before we go further: I&#8217;m going to cover my iPhone Home Screen. The iPad inexplicably didn&#8217;t get the same treatment, so the uses of the widgets there aren&#8217;t the same. The multitasking aspects of the iPad don&#8217;t lend it to the same use case as the iPhone, which I actually like: these are ever-diverging devices, both with their set use cases. Back to the iPhone\u2026</p>\n<p>I try to keep as few Home Screens as possible. I prefer the minimalist approach rather than having multiple pages to swipe through. On iOS 13 I kept 2 Home Screens: the main page \u2013\u00a0which was usually blank \u2013\u00a0with a 3-icon dock, and a second page of folders to house my apps. With iOS 14 and introduction of the App Library, I&#8217;m back down to a single Home Screen. I like that I can swipe to get to the Today view, or swipe to get to the App Library. Everything is a quick swipe away.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1948\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1948\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1948\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/clear-spaces-for-a-clear-mind/my-ios-14-3-iphone-home-screen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?fit=3975%2C2636&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3975,2636\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"My iOS 14.3 iPhone Home Screen\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;My full iPhone Home Screen experience&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?fit=450%2C298&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1948\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?resize=450%2C298&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?resize=1536%2C1019&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?resize=2048%2C1358&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?resize=1100%2C729&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w, https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/My-iOS-14.3-iPhone-Home-Screen.png?w=3300&amp;ssl=1 3300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My full iPhone Home Screen experience</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&#8217;ve retained the 3-icon dock, because that&#8217;s what looks right to me.

As I said in my <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-22-review-widgets-scribble-and-more/\">Drafts review for iOS 14</a>, the use of a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts</a> widget negates my need of the icon in my dock. So I now had to rethink how I use the dock. And with the change in iOS 14.3, which allows Home Screen shortcuts to be run without bouncing into the Shortcuts app and then to the app you wanted to be in, I decided to start putting apps at my fingertips.</p>\n<p>I created two launcher-style shortcuts: these shortcuts present a menu of apps in compact UI; when one is selected, the shortcut kicks over to that app without going to Shortcuts first. I don&#8217;t know that I would have done this before the change in 14.3, if I&#8217;m being honest. The icon on the left is for media and consumption apps; the icon on the right is for social and web-related apps. I am using icons provided in the <a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/echoes\">echoes pack</a> on Gumroad, which I&#8217;ve found to be aesthetically pleasing and matches my <a href=\"https://pin.it/7HfbaWA\">wallpaper</a> (which I modified) as well. I like that I can tap the icons and go to multiple apps without having to slide over to the App Library: sure it&#8217;s easy to do that, but I also avoid seeing the badges on app icons there and keeps me more focused during the day.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1949\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1949\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1949\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/clear-spaces-for-a-clear-mind/ios-14-3-dock-shortcuts/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?fit=3975%2C2636&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3975,2636\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iOS 14.3 Dock Shortcuts\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Home Screen shortcuts in my dock are more powerful in iOS 14.3&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?fit=450%2C298&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1949\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?resize=1024%2C679&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?resize=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?resize=450%2C298&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?resize=768%2C509&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?resize=1536%2C1019&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?resize=2048%2C1358&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?resize=1100%2C729&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14.3-Dock-Shortcuts.png?w=3300&amp;ssl=1 3300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1949\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Home Screen shortcuts in my dock are more powerful in iOS 14.3</figcaption></figure>\n<p>My widget layout has changed a little since the summer betas.

For Drafts, the first widget is for my workspaces and a few quick actions for adding tasks/drafts or searching. The second widget is a few of the same actions, but adds a few additional actions I use from the widget. I&#8217;ve been set on these for a while, but I have some plans to change them.<sup id=\"fnref-1950-later\"><a href=\"#fn-1950-later\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>With all of the widgets, they center around an idea of having a clean Home Screen. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always enjoyed. But I also like having a productive screen as well, and this method gives me the best of both worlds. In all of the widgets, Clear Spaces is at or near the center of the stack to allow for quick swiping up and down to get to a different layout. As I go through my day, I may change the app that&#8217;s there to give me a visual cue to focus. I might keep my task manager on work rather than my personal when I need to focus up on work things. I might keep FoodNoms on the screen to make sure I&#8217;m keeping track of my food intake, but I&#8217;m a quick swipe away to my meal plan so I can know what&#8217;s ahead for dinner. But as I get through different aspects of my day, I always swipe to the Clear Spaces widget in the stack to have a clear Home Screen, almost like checking off a task. When I&#8217;m done with that particular area of focus for the day, it can simply go away. And the next day, I wake up and swipe my widget back in like it&#8217;s March 294th.</p>\n<div style= \"text-align:center;\">\n<div style=\"width: 480px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-1950-1\" width=\"480\" height=\"1039\" autoplay=\"1\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14_3-Home-Screen-Video.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14_3-Home-Screen-Video.mp4\">https://nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14_3-Home-Screen-Video.mp4</a></video></div>\n</div>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that there will be changes over time, but I&#8217;m really happy with my current setup. Of course, there are a few apps that are missing from widgets that I&#8217;d love. I&#8217;m getting more into photography, and I&#8217;d love to see an app like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Halide</a> develop a widget to open the camera into different modes for quicker access. I wish I could have a task management app where I could check off the tasks from the widget itself, like the old Today widgets used to be. And I wish that Apple would allow for a 4&#215;4 small widget for Shortcuts and Drafts so that I can have more combinations and possibilities. I&#8217;ll remind myself that this is just the first iteration of this, but it&#8217;s something that I still don&#8217;t understand 6 months into this OS.</p>\n<p>But for now, I&#8217;m using widgets and Home Screen shortcuts to have more power when I need it. And when I don&#8217;t, I can simply swipe away widgets to create a clear space for my clear mind. I&#8217;ve been more mindful of my day, and I think this new Home Screen layout has something to do with it. It just might work for you too.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1950-later\">\nMore on that in a different post.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1950-later\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

In all of the widgets, Clear Spaces is at or near the center of the stack to allow for quick swiping up and down to get to a different layout. As I go through my day, I may change the app that&#8217;s there to give me a visual cue to focus. I might keep my task manager on work rather than my personal when I need to focus up on work things. I might keep FoodNoms on the screen to make sure I&#8217;m keeping track of my food intake, but I&#8217;m a quick swipe away to my meal plan so I can know what&#8217;s ahead for dinner. But as I get through different aspects of my day, I always swipe to the Clear Spaces widget in the stack to have a clear Home Screen, almost like checking off a task. When I&#8217;m done with that particular area of focus for the day, it can simply go away. And the next day, I wake up and swipe my widget back in like it&#8217;s March 294th.\n\n\nhttps://nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iOS-14_3-Home-Screen-Video.mp4\n\nI&#8217;m sure that there will be changes over time, but I&#8217;m really happy with my current setup. Of course, there are a few apps that are missing from widgets that I&#8217;d love. I&#8217;m getting more into photography, and I&#8217;d love to see an app like Halide develop a widget to open the camera into different modes for quicker access. I wish I could have a task management app where I could check off the tasks from the widget itself, like the old Today widgets used to be. And I wish that Apple would allow for a 4&#215;4 small widget for Shortcuts and Drafts so that I can have more combinations and possibilities. I&#8217;ll remind myself that this is just the first iteration of this, but it&#8217;s something that I still don&#8217;t understand 6 months into this OS.\nBut for now, I&#8217;m using widgets and Home Screen shortcuts to have more power when I need it. And when I don&#8217;t, I can simply swipe away widgets to create a clear space for my clear mind. I&#8217;ve been more mindful of my day, and I think this new Home Screen layout has something to do with it. It just might work for you too.\n\n\n\n\nMore on that in a different post.&#160;&#8617;",

However, my first thought went to Shortcuts when I saw it (hence my tweet). Renaming of files on iOS is a perfect use case of Shortcuts. But rather than stop at just simply renaming a file, it&#8217;s possible to submit the entry all with a couple of taps on iOS. And now that I&#8217;ve said that you can do it with Shortcuts, I figured I should make one if I&#8217;m going to put out the thought. So, with a little bit of work, I created the <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/de2420ea82e140adbbfdc57ce6415721\">#ShotOniPhone</a> shortcut.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1557\"></span></p>\n<p>When you install it, you&#8217;ll be prompted to input your first and last names: these items are required for the file name if you are going to email in the submission.

Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted for an image caption to go with the perfect #ShotOniPhone image. Then, the image will be given a new file name \u2013\u00a0which Apple requires for the email submission portion \u2013\u00a0using the dictionary items you were prompted for when first installing the shortcut and pulling the device type from the image metadata itself.<sup id=\"fnref-1557-suggested\"><a href=\"#fn-1557-suggested\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Finally, there are a few options for submission: Twitter, Instagram, or email.<sup id=\"fnref-1557-weibo\"><a href=\"#fn-1557-weibo\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> You&#8217;ll select which one you would like to choose, and follow the steps from there. (For the Instagram step, it is important to note that the caption is copied to the clipboard and you will have to manually paste it in caption area of the app.) Each method passes the image in its full resolution to the application of choice; I&#8217;d recommend email as the first submission, as Twitter and Instagram will likely compress the image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1559\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/shotoniphone-shortcut/shotoniphone-shortcut-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?fit=1122%2C10439&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1122,10439\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ShotOniPhone Shortcut\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?fit=48%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?fit=110%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1559\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=110%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"110\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=110%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 110w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=768%2C7145&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=1075%2C9999&amp;ssl=1 1075w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?w=1122&amp;ssl=1 1122w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it!
