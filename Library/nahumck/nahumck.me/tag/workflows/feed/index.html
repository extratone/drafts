										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I created a shortcut for the Club MacStories Discord as part of the Automation Academy. If you&#8217;re not a <a href="https://club.macstories.net/">member</a>, I highly recommend doing so. This shortcut was in response to the latest lesson, all about Reminders. I&#8217;ve been meaning to create this for a while, and it seemed like a good idea to apply this lesson in practice.</p>
<p>From the Discord:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I&#8217;ve been using packing lists in Drafts for a long time. Once it is created in Drafts, I send a single task over to Reminders with a link back to the packing list. This has worked well for years, but when I read the piece by Federico, I thought that maybe it&#8217;d be a good idea to make a customizable, variable shortcut for a packing list in Reminders instead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I do appreciate this shortcut, as it creates reminders with subtasks in a packing list. Unfortunately, there are three things I do not like about it after using it for a short while: first, I cannot create a new list for each trip I without manual interaction; second, it clutters up my system with a lot of new tasks; third, it takes longer than I&#8217;d like to run. Now, that last point is a complete nitpick, but the first is critically important. There has been more than one occasion where I have needed to pack for work trip and then a subsequent personal trip. Having two lists to separate them is more ideal for me.</p>
<p>I started thinking about how I could better use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8&#038;uo=4&#038;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> to manage all of this. I have had a <a href="https://nahumck.me/making-2do-lists-better/">single packing list</a> action for a long time. My biggest complaint about using this method is that it wasn&#8217;t variable for the type of trip I was taking. I&#8217;d run the action to create the same list over and over, then have to remove items that weren&#8217;t applicable to that particular trip. That kind of solution works, but is far less elegant. Having just gone through the shortcut activity, I couldn&#8217;t help but think that there was a better solution for me: cleaner appearance in Reminders and faster automation with Drafts.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I created a new tag <code>packing</code>. This tag is only used by my newly created <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/w/1sV">Packing workspace</a>. None of my other workspaces contain this tag, and this workspace contains only this tag. I&#8217;ve also archived these particular drafts to keep them out of any other workspace inbox in the future, so it&#8217;s very filtered for what I need. Next, I take each category from my shortcut and make its own draft. Within each draft, the title line is formatted <code>### Category</code> and I have checkboxes for each item underneath. I can modify each draft as I need, or I can add completely new categories with items to pack.</p>
<p>Using a query on the drafts with the specific tag, I created a checklist prompt: it presents the same information as what was in Shortcuts and functions in much the same way. I even briefly thought about making an HTML prompt for this, but thought that this was easier and fits a user&#8217;s preferred theme better; this is about quick interaction after all, right?. The way this is constructed grabs all of the draft titles and presents them as items; as the categories grow, so does the list.</p>

<p>The next script then pulls in the selected draft content, and compiles it into a single list. There&#8217;s an optional forth step, which creates a new task in Reminders with the URL to the newly created draft. I personally don&#8217;t like the way this is rendered as just the URL. I actually use Siri to do this, usually when on my iPad by pressing Globe + S and typing to Siri &#8220;remind me of this&#8221;. This shows the Drafts icon to the right of the task and the URL; I will delete the URL part, which still keeps a link via the icon on the right, for cleanliness.</p>

<p>This might seem a bit more complex than editing a single shortcut, but there are a few reasons why I prefer this method. First, It runs really quickly: sure, I might only be saving a few seconds, but it makes me <em>feel</em> better. Next, I think that the manipulation of text within a draft, combined with the power of <a href="https://nahumck.me/arrange-mode-in-drafts/">arrange mode</a> in Drafts, is better. I can also duplicate categories – like with my backpack and travel sling – to make a different version with or without camera gear far easier than creating another array in Shortcuts. Finally, it keeps me in Drafts. I&#8217;m not saying that Shortcuts isn&#8217;t the right tool for most here, but I know that Drafts is a better tool for me. I trust the system I&#8217;ve developed over years, and it doesn&#8217;t let me down. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t say the same for Shortcuts: even in the setup of the packing checklist shortcut, there were bugs that prevented me from completing it fully. With the groundwork done in Drafts, this is fully extensible and will adapt to new situations or changes in my gear.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m going to travel slightly more than I have in the past, having this type of <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1sT">flexible packing list</a> will keep me better prepared for travel. As I continue to venture out into The World, A.C., <sup id="fnref-2174-covid"><a href="#fn-2174-covid" class="jetpack-footnote" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> I&#8217;ll have the confidence and assurance that I have packed everything I need for any type of trip that might come my way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get asked often for what&#8217;s on my Home Screen: what apps, what wallpaper, what layout. Now with iOS 14, I&#8217;m asked about my widget setup as well. I&#8217;ve shared some updates through posts and social media sporadically. A lot of my current setup is visually unchanged (except the wallpaper), but I wanted to cover the <em>why</em> of the Home Screen &#8211; where apps/widgets are placed, what stacks are being used, and now I&#8217;m using them together for a more streamlined, productive setup.<br />
<span id="more-1950"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll state this now before we go further: I&#8217;m going to cover my iPhone Home Screen. The iPad inexplicably didn&#8217;t get the same treatment, so the uses of the widgets there aren&#8217;t the same. The multitasking aspects of the iPad don&#8217;t lend it to the same use case as the iPhone, which I actually like: these are ever-diverging devices, both with their set use cases. Back to the iPhone…</p>
<p>I try to keep as few Home Screens as possible. I prefer the minimalist approach rather than having multiple pages to swipe through. On iOS 13 I kept 2 Home Screens: the main page – which was usually blank – with a 3-icon dock, and a second page of folders to house my apps. With iOS 14 and introduction of the App Library, I&#8217;m back down to a single Home Screen. I like that I can swipe to get to the Today view, or swipe to get to the App Library.

<p>I&#8217;ve retained the 3-icon dock, because that&#8217;s what looks right to me. I&#8217;ve used this time to experiment with a 4-icon dock, but it feels off. Call me neurotic, but that&#8217;s just how I see it. As I said in my <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-22-review-widgets-scribble-and-more/">Drafts review for iOS 14</a>, the use of a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> widget negates my need of the icon in my dock. So I now had to rethink how I use the dock. And with the change in iOS 14.3, which allows Home Screen shortcuts to be run without bouncing into the Shortcuts app and then to the app you wanted to be in, I decided to start putting apps at my fingertips.</p>
<p>I created two launcher-style shortcuts: these shortcuts present a menu of apps in compact UI; when one is selected, the shortcut kicks over to that app without going to Shortcuts first. I don&#8217;t know that I would have done this before the change in 14.3, if I&#8217;m being honest. The icon on the left is for media and consumption apps; the icon on the right is for social and web-related apps. I am using icons provided in the <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/echoes">echoes pack</a> on Gumroad, which I&#8217;ve found to be aesthetically pleasing and matches my <a href="https://pin.it/7HfbaWA">wallpaper</a> (which I modified) as well. I like that I can tap the icons and go to multiple apps without having to slide over to the App Library: sure it&#8217;s easy to do that, but I also avoid seeing the badges on app icons there and keeps me more focused during the day.</p>

<p>My widget layout has changed a little since the summer betas. I use 4 small widgets and one medium on the Home Screen, all with stacks and without Smart Rotate turned on. I placed the widgets in their respective locations based on use: it would never make sense to me that I put a Drafts widget all the way at the top when I access it all the time. So the order of importance always starts above the dock and works upwards. All of them have a specific function and different apps within; all of them contain one &#8220;blank&#8221; widget, which is from the app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-spaces/id1532666619?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Clear Spaces</a> – but more on why that is later. I think the best way to show you is to have the layout with the stacks and the titles of each, and then explain them.</p>

<p><strong>Calendar</strong>: this stack has the calendar to see my next events, as well as a Castro widget to quickly access my queue. This is pretty much self explanatory.</p>
<p><strong>Weather</strong>: I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Carrot Weather</a> as my weather app because it&#8217;s the best weather app for me. I have two different widgets: the first is forecast so that I can see the forecast for the day, and the second is a daily forecast so I can view 5 days of weather if I need to look at that quickly as well.</p>
<p><strong>Task Management</strong>: I&#8217;ve been using Reminders more and more, thanks to some deep integrations with task assignment. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it works. I&#8217;ve tried <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-manager/id1068039220?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">GoodTask</a> and even used it for a while, but until Apple provides the tools to developers to fully tie into the full feature set, I&#8217;ll be staying with Reminders. I have two Reminders widgets, one for the Today smart list and the other for my Grocery List. The remaining widget in there is for Drafts, which brings up my Work workspace where I keep my work tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Health</strong>: I&#8217;m doing my best to be better, I really am. To help me improve, I&#8217;m using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/foodnoms-food-tracker/id1479461686?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">FoodNoms</a> for food tracking, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitbod-workout-fitness-plans/id1041517543?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Fitbod</a> for my workouts, monitoring my rings with Activity, and keeping my diet steady in a shared note with my girlfriend for our meal plan.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity</strong>: I have 2 different Drafts widgets and 2 Shortcuts widgets. For Drafts, the first widget is for my workspaces and a few quick actions for adding tasks/drafts or searching. The second widget is a few of the same actions, but adds a few additional actions I use from the widget. I&#8217;ve been set on these for a while, but I have some plans to change them.<sup id="fnref-1950-later"><a href="#fn-1950-later" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>With all of the widgets, they center around an idea of having a clean Home Screen. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve always enjoyed. But I also like having a productive screen as well, and this method gives me the best of both worlds. In all of the widgets, Clear Spaces is at or near the center of the stack to allow for quick swiping up and down to get to a different layout. As I go through my day, I may change the app that&#8217;s there to give me a visual cue to focus. I might keep my task manager on work rather than my personal when I need to focus up on work things. I might keep FoodNoms on the screen to make sure I&#8217;m keeping track of my food intake, but I&#8217;m a quick swipe away to my meal plan so I can know what&#8217;s ahead for dinner. But as I get through different aspects of my day, I always swipe to the Clear Spaces widget in the stack to have a clear Home Screen, almost like checking off a task. When I&#8217;m done with that particular area of focus for the day, it can simply go away. And the next day, I wake up and swipe my widget back in like it&#8217;s March 294th.</p>

</div>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that there will be changes over time, but I&#8217;m really happy with my current setup. Of course, there are a few apps that are missing from widgets that I&#8217;d love. I&#8217;m getting more into photography, and I&#8217;d love to see an app like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Halide</a> develop a widget to open the camera into different modes for quicker access. I wish I could have a task management app where I could check off the tasks from the widget itself, like the old Today widgets used to be. And I wish that Apple would allow for a 4&#215;4 small widget for Shortcuts and Drafts so that I can have more combinations and possibilities. I&#8217;ll remind myself that this is just the first iteration of this, but it&#8217;s something that I still don&#8217;t understand 6 months into this OS.</p>
<p>But for now, I&#8217;m using widgets and Home Screen shortcuts to have more power when I need it. And when I don&#8217;t, I can simply swipe away widgets to create a clear space for my clear mind. I&#8217;ve been more mindful of my day, and I think this new Home Screen layout has something to do with it. It just might work for you too.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>When I first saw Rene&#8217;s tweet, I knew he was being snarky. However, my first thought went to Shortcuts when I saw it (hence my tweet). Renaming of files on iOS is a perfect use case of Shortcuts. But rather than stop at just simply renaming a file, it&#8217;s possible to submit the entry all with a couple of taps on iOS. And now that I&#8217;ve said that you can do it with Shortcuts, I figured I should make one if I&#8217;m going to put out the thought. So, with a little bit of work, I created the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/de2420ea82e140adbbfdc57ce6415721">#ShotOniPhone</a> shortcut.<br />
<span id="more-1557"></span></p>
<p>When you install it, you&#8217;ll be prompted to input your first and last names: these items are required for the file name if you are going to email in the submission. Once you&#8217;ve entered that information, you can either run this as a stand alone shortcut or as an extension from the Photos app.</p>
<p>The first part of the action checks to see if any images were input, and if not, prompts you to select an image; I&#8217;ve used this little block countless times in other shortcuts, and copied the same method here. Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted for an image caption to go with the perfect #ShotOniPhone image. Then, the image will be given a new file name – which Apple requires for the email submission portion – using the dictionary items you were prompted for when first installing the shortcut and pulling the device type from the image metadata itself.<sup id="fnref-1557-suggested"><a href="#fn-1557-suggested" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, there are a few options for submission: Twitter, Instagram, or email.<sup id="fnref-1557-weibo"><a href="#fn-1557-weibo" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> You&#8217;ll select which one you would like to choose, and follow the steps from there. (For the Instagram step, it is important to note that the caption is copied to the clipboard and you will have to manually paste it in caption area of the app.) Each method passes the image in its full resolution to the application of choice; I&#8217;d recommend email as the first submission, as Twitter and Instagram will likely compress the image.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it! This shortcut may seem complex, but it&#8217;s really simple to run once you get it installed. Not only does it rename the photo for you, it also helps you submit your photo to the challenge. Now anyone can shoot and submit to this #ShotOniPhone Challenge, all from their iPhone. Turns Out<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, you don&#8217;t need a Mac to do it after all…</p>

This was suggested by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/tverschoren">Thomas Verschoren</a>, and I&#8217;ve updated the shortcut to reflect this. Thanks for the suggestion!&#160;<a href="#fnref-1557-suggested">&#8617;</a>

Weibo is also a part of this, but I don&#8217;t have the ability to add the action. So… maybe someone else can add it.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1557-weibo">&#8617;</a>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the small, but powerful for which I use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1236254471?at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> is sending multiple events to my calendars. And for a long time, I&#8217;ve used the power of Drafts&#8217; automation to send those events to my calendar via <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id718043190?at=1001l4VZ">Fantastical</a>.</p>
<p>That is until <a href="https://twitter.com/pdavisonreiber">Peter Davison-Reiber</a> created something amazing.<br />
<span id="more-1393"></span></p>
<p>The great thing about using Fantastical for this purpose is the natural language parsing capabilities: I can simply type out a calendar event the way I need to type it, and it will populate it for me. But thanks to the incredible <a href="http://reference.getdrafts.com/">scripting capabilities in Drafts 5</a>, it is possible to create the date and time parsing aspects – the part where Fantastical excels – and put that right into an action in Drafts.</p>
<p>The end result is as advertised – <a href="https://polymaths.blog/2018/06/fantastically-good-event-parser-for-drafts-5">fantastically good</a>. Not only does it replicate the way I input events into my calendar, but it does it even faster now that it&#8217;s all native in Drafts. There is no longer a back-and-forth dance with the action to create multiple events. It runs quickly, and I can move along with what I was working on when it is completed. I can also include locations and durations as well. I can even use the calendar shortcut syntax (example: <code>/w</code> for my work calendar) with the action. It is a really robust solution.<sup id="fnref-1393-1"><a href="#fn-1393-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, Peter requested the changed in <a href="http://getdrafts.com/changelog">Drafts 5.3</a> which provide the same parsing for <a href="https://polymaths.blog/2018/07/fantastically-good-reminder-parser-for-drafts-5">reminders</a> as well, which replaces the other aspect of Fantastical for me. You can include the level of priority denoted by exclamation marks <code>!</code> and use the reminder list denoted by the same shortcut syntax as the calendar (<code>/inbox</code>).</p>
<p>These two actions are what I had envisioned in the <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/4/#gtd">GTD module of my review</a>. This is a case where I knew that they were going to be possible, but I do not have the technical knowledge to create. Initially, I wanted to create one based on some unique syntax, similar to the <a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Cc">Send to Things</a> action. But what Peter has done here exceeded my expectations and is fantastically awesome.</p>
<p><em>Cheers Peter!</em></p>

There is a limitation of creating recurring events via the API. This may come in the future.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1393-1">&#8617;</a>
