										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last year, I had transitioned away from GoodTask to Things, then Todoist, then back to Things. I might have even missed a quick affair with OmniFocus as well. But I digress.</p>
<p>GoodTask has been my long-time favorite Reminders client. From the <a href="https://nahumck.me/goodtask-3-an-unexpected-surprise/">surprise</a> the first time I started really using it to now, it has made improvement after improvement in both functionality and appearance settings (love me those themes) on all platforms – iOS, macOS, and the Apple Watch. I was inclined to go back to GoodTask when the Apple Watch app was updated, so I moved everything over there in the beta. I had mentioned to the developer that there were a couple features which I was missing from Things, but I was very happy with the improvements to the apps. Those suggestions plus others were carefully considered, because they are now in the version 4.5 update of the app.<br />
<span id="more-1579"></span></p>
<h1>Tag Sorting</h1>
<p>GoodTask 4.5 brings with it the ability to sort a List or Smart List based on tags. Tags are a clever implementation in GoodTask, which puts a <code>#tag</code> into the note of a reminder. GoodTask can parse this as a tag, and allow you to use that information within the note as a tag, much like the other information the developer uses to implement sub tasks. You can use all of your tags or specific tags per list, which is great for customizing how you view your different lists.</p>
<p>With the new tag options, I&#8217;m able to now recreate some of the features that Things provided which gives me a better view of my tasks in different views. It all stems from the ability to sort lists and smart lists using Tags first, then due dates, etc.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the headings feature of Things. When I have a specific project, having the breakout of different subsections is better for my brain. And with the tag sorting, I can re-create this now in GoodTask. For example, I can take all of the tasks in my Nerd Life<sup id="fnref-1579-affectionate"><a href="#fn-1579-affectionate" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>, apply the tags, and have the list sorted on them. While it may not be quite as pretty as the Things implementation, the capability in GoodTask allows me to break it down to key areas just the same.</p>

<p>Another key feature of Things that I adore is the Today view. Having your tasks along with the calendar is a fantastic singular view of what is ahead of me. Having a separate &#8216;today&#8217; and &#8216;evening&#8217; section has been critical for me to quickly view and clarify what needs to be done. Now with the tag sorting, I can recreate this view in GoodTask. I created a Smart List which includes my calendar, tasks scheduled for today, and any overdue tasks. This list is sorted by Tag then Due Date, and I also have my calendar events sorted on top, listed under the order section. I created a quick action to apply a <code>#Today</code> and <code>#Evening</code> tag as a toggle, so that I can quickly tag tasks which show up in the view. Again, this might not be as visually appealing as the Things view, but it provides me what I need while keeping the native Reminders service integration.</p>

<h3>Completing Tasks</h3>
<p>For a while now, I&#8217;ve been wanting to see more <a href="https://nahumck.me/rethinking-reminders/">improvements to Reminders</a>, but lately I&#8217;ve been wanting improved support within Shortcuts. When I think of what I want Shortcuts to ultimately be, I can&#8217;t help but want certain features added: for Reminders, having the ability to check off a task would be beneficial for certain shortcuts. So while we wait Shortcuts.app to catch up, GoodTask has added a Siri Shortcut to complete a task (and do so in the background). You&#8217;ll need to go to Settings → Siri Shortcuts → Add Complete Task to get the Siri Shortcut and/or add it to Shortcuts.app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting old, so I take vitamins. I use a reminder to trigger this, so I don&#8217;t forget. I took this one step further and created a shortcut to run on my iPhone which logs the vitamin intake – including all the breakdown of the various types of vitamins – into the Health app, as well as mark it in Streaks as complete to help me keep track of when I&#8217;ve taken it. I always thought it would be nice to complete the reminder as well, but I the lack of the feature has prevented it. But now, I can copy the exact title of the task (and it must be exact) for my vitamins, add a text block and some clipboard actions to save and retrieve,<sup id="fnref-1579-implementation"><a href="#fn-1579-implementation" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> then add the GoodTask Complete Task action block; I also turned off the &#8220;Show When Run&#8221; option so that it runs seamlessly in the background.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="1584" data-permalink="https://nahumck.me/goodtask-4-5-checking-all-the-boxes/vitamins_gt_complete/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=1325%2C2616&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1325,2616" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Vitamins_GT_Complete" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=228%2C450&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=519%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=228%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="228" height="450" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1584" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=228%2C450&amp;ssl=1 228w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=768%2C1516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=519%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 519w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=1200%2C2369&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?w=1325&amp;ssl=1 1325w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I use the native Reminders notifications due to the fact that they remain on the lock screen, but actions like the one outlined above have me rethinking that approach. GoodTask allows users to run a URL from the notification, which means I could run the shortcut straight from the notification and complete it all in one go. I&#8217;ll likely look to play around with this as time goes on.<sup id="fnref-1579-breath"><a href="#fn-1579-breath" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The full list of improvements can be <a href="https://forum.goodtaskapp.com/t/goodtask-4-5-update/157/3">found on the forums</a>. Having been away for a while, I can see that there is a lot more to offer now with GoodTask than ever before. The developer is listening to suggestions, is adding features at a manageable pace, and I can really appreciate the level of continued development for the app.</p>

Perhaps with iOS 13 around the corner Reminders will be improved, or third-party app notifications will be given the ability to perform in the same manner as Reminders. But I won&#8217;t hold my breath for either one.&#160;<a href="#fnref-1579-breath">&#8617;</a>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been an update released today for my task management app of choice, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1068039220?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">GoodTask</a>. There is a lot to unpack with this update; you can read more in the <a href="https://medium.com/p/goodtask-for-ios-3-6-update-7afa59f59709">full details</a> for the update.</p>
<p>There are some great things that I want to quickly highlight:</p>
<ul style="padding:50px">
<li><strong>Full Drag/Drop support</strong>: There is a comprehensive list found in the full details. A couple of really nice touches include the ability to drag one or more tasks onto another task to create subtasks. You can also drag subtasks out to be full tasks. </li>
<li><strong>Smart Button</strong>: Navigating your lists is now easier than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Tasks page</strong>: if you swipe from left to right on a task, it now puts you into the Quick Actions screen of your task. From there, you can use swipe to go to the other screens or the buttons at the top to change from screen to screen.</li>
<li><strong>Subtasks</strong>: Subtasks have been improved by including them inline as part of the task. This allows you to see what is left of a small project and move forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing some items, but it&#8217;s the things that are making me stick with this. I&#8217;m absolutely loving my time with GoodTask.</p>
<p><small>GoodTask is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1068039220?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme">available on the App Store for Free</a> with an optional (but <em>highly</em> recommended) IAP of $5.</small></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s fall &#8211; damn near winter &#8211; and that can only mean one thing: time to make my task management more complicated. I often use the summer to make my life <a href="https://nahumck.me/basic/">simple</a>, and then spend some time making things <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">overly</span> complicated. I&#8217;m always looking for a better way to handle my tasks. I&#8217;ve tried many task managers, and had gone through all of them. Or so I thought. I&#8217;ve had a few people suggest some apps to me, and I often think: <em>do I really need another app</em>? Apparently, the answer is yes. But this time <em>feels</em> different.</p>
<p>Enter <a title="GoodTask" href="http://goodtaskapp.com/index.html">GoodTask</a>.<br />
<span id="more-1216"></span><br />
There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here. I know I won’t cover everything possible, but I&#8217;ll do my best to tell you why it’s important to me now. First and foremost, GoodTask &#8211; available for both <a title="GoodTask 3 for iOS" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1068039220?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">iOS</a> and <a title="GoodTask 3 for macOS" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1143437985?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">macOS</a> &#8211; is build upon Reminders. It uses the Reminders integration and provides very fast sync across devices and with the integrations themselves; in fact, I usually see a task show up in a second or less when I use <em>Hey, Siri</em>. The benefit here is that my tasks don&#8217;t need to have a separate, proprietary sync engine: it can use native sync with all the benefits therein.</p>
<p>The iOS app is free, with a $5 in-app purchase to unlock the power features. While you can try the app, you don’t really get to experience the full app without buying the IAP.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> I’m using the best parts of GoodTask: <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help13.html">the URL scheme</a>, themes (dark mode!), <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help7.html">text snippets</a>, and <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help10.html">quick actions</a>. I&#8217;m not using the notifications, however; I&#8217;m still using Reminders for that aspect because notifications persist. Additionally, because I’m a big fan of the <a title="Keep It Simple" href="https://nahumck.me/keep-it-simple/">Siri Watch Face</a>, my tasks are surfaced there without having to use a different app on the watch. The GoodTask watch app isn’t as good as something like <a title="Things 3 for iPhone and Apple Watch" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Things</a>, but it does allow you to see your tasks and add a new one from your wrist. In general, I’m adding tasks in other ways; if I have to add a task from my watch, I find it much easier to use Siri to do so. And that&#8217;s a benefit of using tight integration with Reminders: I get all the benefits of a highly-functional app while using all the benefits of a native solution. There really is no down side here.</p>
<p>There are some additional benefits that GoodTask provides over Reminders. Search in Reminders is great, but GoodTask goes the extra step to have Smart Lists to create saved searches. This goes back to an aspect of what I <a href="https://nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do/">loved about 2Do</a>, and is something that I&#8217;ve missed while trying other apps as well. I can search text, tags, etc. to compile what I need to view across my tasks. The repeat options are the the same as Reminders, with one notable exception: repeat after completion. I really like using this option for tasks like specific cleaning, furnace filters, and other things that need to be completed with a frequency but have the flexibility of when I do them.</p>
<p>There are two unique ways that you can speed up task entry. First, you can setup customizable quick actions. These quick actions can be dates, times, time intervals, tags, etc.; there are even quick actions to set up repetitive tasks. I have a few set up for dropping off or picking up prescriptions, dry cleaning, and some other work-related tasks that aren’t regularly repeating, but occur frequently enough to have a quick entry option. The second quick-entry feature is user-defined text snippets. While it isn’t full natural language parsing, it greatly speeds up entry. You can add “Wednesday 7p” and it will set the date and time without having to select each one in the regular fields of the task. You can customize the snippets to work for you, using common words or other shorthand to enter your tasks quickly.</p>

<p>The developers at have come up with a way of storing extra information to provide greater functionality than the built in Reminders.app: by using the notes field of the task, they can add details about the reminder that GT parses. Because of this clever use of the field, the app can provide tags and subtasks: <code>#tags</code> have a simple syntax, where subtasks follow a more complex format of</p>
<p><code>..gt3[{"Subtasks":["0SubTask1","0SubTask2",...,"0SubTaskN"]}]gt3</code>.</p>
<p>With that syntax in the notes field, GoodTask will read that information and treat it like a checklist.</p>
<p>Knowing the syntax of the subtasks and realizing that it can be read by adding text to the note field, I can start opening up some automation possibilities. When I started looking into moving some things over, I quickly realized that I can simply use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quick-capture/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> for <a href="https://nahumck.me/trusted-capture-with-drafts/">trusted capture</a>, just as I always have.</p>
<p>I set up an action with Drafts that sends over a task via the Smart Add functionality of <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help13.html">the URL scheme</a>. When using Smart Add, the text snippets you type automatically expand and populate items. So when I look at <a title="Carrot Weather" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">the weather</a> and see that it will rain in the morning, I can quickly open up Drafts, type &#8220;Take Umbrella tomorrow morning alert&#8221;, and send a reminder into GoodTask; it will receive the text, parse the text snippets, and create a &#8220;Take Umbrella&#8221; reminder with due time of 7:00am that will trigger an alert.</p>
<p>That action is great for moving a single task or a selection over, but what about a list? This is where knowing the syntax really helps. I wanted to move my house list over to GT. It&#8217;s a list of a plethora of items <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that I don&#8217;t have time to complete</span>. For a while, I&#8217;ve been using Drafts to store all of those types of lists. I&#8217;ve split it up now, with longer-term projects (like remodeling) residing in Notes and the remainder in a regular list.</p>
<p>Some of the tasks I have around the house are actually small projects, or a task with a few subtasks. Now that I know how the syntax works, I made a <a title="GT3 Subtasks" href="https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/k/2Ht">subtask creation key</a> that takes a group of lines and turns it into the proper syntax for GT to accept.<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Then, I simply put each main task in the format <code>task|note</code> so that I could use <a href="http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1C6">this action</a> that moved it over into Reminders. Here&#8217;s a small example:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1215" data-permalink="https://nahumck.me/goodtask-3-an-unexpected-surprise/image-11-12-17-9-51-am-png/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2048,1536" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" class="size-full wp-image-1215 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Again, the benefit here is using the backbone of the Reminders integrations. The input of the tasks from Drafts to Reminders is simple; the syntax that GoodTask uses to parse subtasks and tags allows for even better integration when using GoodTask as the manager. There are also numerous other possibilities for task entry. Users of <a title="Fantastical for iPad" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-ipad/id830708155?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Fantastical</a> are able to use NLP to send tasks into Reminders, which in turn would show up in GoodTask. I can use Siri to add a simple task. I could use <a title="Workflow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Workflow</a> to create a task from the widget or the watch. I can use the Share Sheet to select Reminders, and input a task in that way. There are a ton of ways to enter my tasks.</p>
<p>There are some weaknesses, but they are small: I can’t use drag/drop to add a message in the same way I can in the Reminders app; I also can’t view a note when I use the “remind me of this later” feature of Siri.<sup><a id="ffn3" class="footnote" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> I’d really like to see 3D Touch and drag/drop improvements for the iOS app, automatic theme options for day/night based on location, and better visual indications for tags. I’d also like to have my view state saved by list, so that I can better view my tasks in each list; my all tasks list would likely be a week view, while my individual lists would be a list view so that I can see all of them. The basis for all of these things are there, and it will just take a bit of effort to incorporate them. Judging from the emails I’ve sent in and the quick responses from the developer, I’m guessing these things are coming soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking to the future of this app, and I feel like I have found a solution where I can get all of the benefits of a power-user app while keeping the native aspects I wanted. GoodTask is the perfect blend of what I need: it&#8217;s a powerhouse tool when it needs to be while giving me all the benefits of the Reminders integrations that proliferate throughout iOS for easy task entry. Until Apple does an <a href="https://nahumck.me/rethinking-reminders/">overhaul of Reminders</a>, this will serve as a phenomenal surrogate.</p>
<ol id="footnotes">
<li id="fn1">My hope is that in the future, the developer will allow a 2-week trial similar to other productivity apps so that you can really understand the full potential of the app. <a href="#ffn1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn2">I’m not a programmer, so the key isn’t perfect. It will take separate lines and group them in the syntax. If you don’t highlight the lines, it will input some text. If I was better at this stuff, it would be improved. But, it’s what I know how to do. <a href="#ffn2"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn3">Which works about 10% of the time and is frustrating as all hell. <a href="#ffn3"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
