We dive in on some of the new stuff from <a href=\"https://nahumck.me/drafts-26-the-customization-update/\">version 26</a> which introduced custom themes and syntaxes. We also touch on a few other <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/misc/changelog-ios.html\">updates</a> from the first version to now as well. I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>There were a couple of things in the episode that I wanted to follow-up on here, including the homework assignment David gave me. I&#8217;m thrilled that the time spent with David and Rosemary gave me the idea, which made me reconsider some things with my personal journaling and changed how I&#8217;m doing it going forward.<br />\n<span id=\"more-2049\"></span></p>\n<h3>Theme Switching with Workspaces</h3>\n<p>Ever since I&#8217;ve used workspaces + action groups to create what I called modules, I&#8217;ve used a script actions to switch between them. Originally, I set each workspace, action group, and keyboard row individually; once the action and keyboard group options were added to the workspace manager, I simplified the actions. I keep the single action in every one of my action groups which I use in the keyboard row to use on the iPhone for quick access to switch. Where I use this switching method a lot is on my iPad, using a hardware keyboard. All of my modules are brought up with keyboard shortcuts, assigned to <code>\u23182 - 9</code>; both <code>\u23181</code> and <code>\u23189</code> are reserved by Drafts for the draft and action list show/hide, respectively.</p>\n<p>With the addition of themes, I&#8217;ve now modified the modules I have to include themes that I want to use in those different contexts. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll update this more over time. I primarily use dark mode, so that&#8217;s what I currently have in there. But you could also modify the scripts to include light themes as well. Here&#8217;s my <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1Jn\">Modules action group</a> as it stands today for you to play with and make your own. You&#8217;ll need to change the theme names in each of the module actions, else you might get an error.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t quite yet cracked the switching of syntaxes based on themes. I have, however, leveraged Matt Gemmell&#8217;s previous Switch Syntax action and <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1jz\">created my own</a> which provides a list of all the installed syntaxes. It&#8217;s not automated, but it does the job when I need it. I&#8217;m sure Rosemary is working on something even more clever\u2026</p>\n<h3>Automated Journaling</h3>\n<p>On the show, we talked about some of the automations I&#8217;ve used (in most cases, continued to use) frequently. One of my journal shortcuts saves the text of the journal as a PDF for future reading. That&#8217;s when David brought up a great suggestion: using a Shortcuts automation at a specific time to automatically save the journal at night so I don&#8217;t have to do it manually.</p>\n<p>It took a few modifications to my original shortcut, but I have the automatic saving of journal entries figured out. The <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4d686cd67ae440448d3e0469080db9d9\">Journal \u2022\u00a0Save</a> shortcut searches my Journal workspace for today&#8217;s journal entry, gets the content of the draft, creates an entry title (formatted <code>Journal Entry yyyy-MM-dd</code>), creates a nicely-formatted PDF, and saves the PDF version to <code>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/Journal/</code>.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-bug\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-bug\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> I manually move these once a week during my weekly review for now, until the Shortcuts team actually gives me that built in feature.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-tried\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-tried\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> This action can be used with Shortcuts automation; if you choose to run the automation without asking, it will run automatically in the background. I have mine set to run at 11:00 pm every day, and in my testing since we recorded, it&#8217;s been working fantastically.</p>\n<p>This then lead me to <strong><em>change</em></strong> the way I&#8217;ve been journaling, so that I can just automate the creation of the journal entry and never miss a day. The old way of starting my journal is answering a couple of questions: did I wear my watch to sleep to get data out of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">AutoSleep</a> \u2013\u00a0a feature that is broken due to an iOS 14.5 bug \u00a0\u2013 and how did I feel when I woke up. Here&#8217;s a secret: I&#8217;m not sure I sleep all that well generally, I never use the quantifiable data in any meaningful way, and I don&#8217;t know that I need a reminder of how shitty all that can be and make me feel. If I want a pretty chart or other meaningful insights, I&#8217;d be better off going into AutoSleep or the Health app to get it. Weighing the importance of sleep tracking vs daily journaling, having a journal entry for every day that is just automatically there just makes more sense.

However, my first thought went to Shortcuts when I saw it (hence my tweet). Renaming of files on iOS is a perfect use case of Shortcuts. But rather than stop at just simply renaming a file, it&#8217;s possible to submit the entry all with a couple of taps on iOS. And now that I&#8217;ve said that you can do it with Shortcuts, I figured I should make one if I&#8217;m going to put out the thought. So, with a little bit of work, I created the <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/de2420ea82e140adbbfdc57ce6415721\">#ShotOniPhone</a> shortcut.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1557\"></span></p>\n<p>When you install it, you&#8217;ll be prompted to input your first and last names: these items are required for the file name if you are going to email in the submission. Once you&#8217;ve entered that information, you can either run this as a stand alone shortcut or as an extension from the Photos app.</p>\n<p>The first part of the action checks to see if any images were input, and if not, prompts you to select an image; I&#8217;ve used this little block countless times in other shortcuts, and copied the same method here. Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted for an image caption to go with the perfect #ShotOniPhone image. Then, the image will be given a new file name \u2013\u00a0which Apple requires for the email submission portion \u2013\u00a0using the dictionary items you were prompted for when first installing the shortcut and pulling the device type from the image metadata itself.<sup id=\"fnref-1557-suggested\"><a href=\"#fn-1557-suggested\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Finally, there are a few options for submission: Twitter, Instagram, or email.<sup id=\"fnref-1557-weibo\"><a href=\"#fn-1557-weibo\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> You&#8217;ll select which one you would like to choose, and follow the steps from there. (For the Instagram step, it is important to note that the caption is copied to the clipboard and you will have to manually paste it in caption area of the app.) Each method passes the image in its full resolution to the application of choice; I&#8217;d recommend email as the first submission, as Twitter and Instagram will likely compress the image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1559\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/shotoniphone-shortcut/shotoniphone-shortcut-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?fit=1122%2C10439&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1122,10439\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ShotOniPhone Shortcut\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?fit=48%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?fit=110%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1559\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=110%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"110\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=110%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 110w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=768%2C7145&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?resize=1075%2C9999&amp;ssl=1 1075w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ShotOniPhone-Shortcut.png?w=1122&amp;ssl=1 1122w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 110px) 100vw, 110px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s it!

            "content_text": "Today, Greg Pierce posted a tweet about the new #ShotOniPhone Challenge:\n\nMy favorite part of this #ShotOniPhone contest announcement is the specification of a file naming convention.\nI bet less than 0.1% of iPhone owners know how to save a photo as a file, rename it, and attach the renamed version to an email.https://t.co/1DOwvaOjvh pic.twitter.com/7C0Yh5xxlz\n\u2014 Greg Pierce (@agiletortoise) January 24, 2019\n\n\nRene Ritchie followed up with this tweet:\n\n#ShotOniPhone #RenamedOnMac\n\u2014 Rene Ritchie (@reneritchie) January 24, 2019\n\n\nAnd my reply:\n\n#ShotOniPhone #RenamedViaShortcuts\n\u2014 Tim Nahumck (@nahumck) January 24, 2019\n\nWhen I first saw Rene&#8217;s tweet, I knew he was being snarky. However, my first thought went to Shortcuts when I saw it (hence my tweet). Renaming of files on iOS is a perfect use case of Shortcuts. But rather than stop at just simply renaming a file, it&#8217;s possible to submit the entry all with a couple of taps on iOS. And now that I&#8217;ve said that you can do it with Shortcuts, I figured I should make one if I&#8217;m going to put out the thought. So, with a little bit of work, I created the #ShotOniPhone shortcut.\n\nWhen you install it, you&#8217;ll be prompted to input your first and last names: these items are required for the file name if you are going to email in the submission. Once you&#8217;ve entered that information, you can either run this as a stand alone shortcut or as an extension from the Photos app.\nThe first part of the action checks to see if any images were input, and if not, prompts you to select an image; I&#8217;ve used this little block countless times in other shortcuts, and copied the same method here. Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted for an image caption to go with the perfect #ShotOniPhone image. Then, the image will be given a new file name \u2013\u00a0which Apple requires for the email submission portion \u2013\u00a0using the dictionary items you were prompted for when first installing the shortcut and pulling the device type from the image metadata itself.1\nFinally, there are a few options for submission: Twitter, Instagram, or email.2 You&#8217;ll select which one you would like to choose, and follow the steps from there. (For the Instagram step, it is important to note that the caption is copied to the clipboard and you will have to manually paste it in caption area of the app.) Each method passes the image in its full resolution to the application of choice; I&#8217;d recommend email as the first submission, as Twitter and Instagram will likely compress the image.\n\nAnd that&#8217;s it! This shortcut may seem complex, but it&#8217;s really simple to run once you get it installed. Not only does it rename the photo for you, it also helps you submit your photo to the challenge. Now anyone can shoot and submit to this #ShotOniPhone Challenge, all from their iPhone. Turns Out, you don&#8217;t need a Mac to do it after all\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThis was suggested by Thomas Verschoren, and I&#8217;ve updated the shortcut to reflect this. Thanks for the suggestion!&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nWeibo is also a part of this, but I don&#8217;t have the ability to add the action. So\u2026 maybe someone else can add it.&#160;&#8617;",

This past time, I decided to do something a bit different, and write more about <a title=\"Gaining Experience\" href=\"https://nahumck.me/gaining-experience/\">how I felt</a> rather than explain it. But, I also realize that this new-to-me idea might need a bit of help and guidance for those that aren&#8217;t well versed in the subject, like me. So I&#8217;ll do my best here to explain.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1000\"></span></p>\n<p>Full disclosure: I&#8217;m not a programmer, I&#8217;m not a developer, I&#8217;m not an expert. So don&#8217;t rely on this post for complex methods.</p>\n<h3>Dictionaries</h3>\n<p>In simple terms, dictionaries are a place to store information in a tabular-like format, similar to a database or an array.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> The difference with dictionaries is that they use key/value pairs: using &#8220;keys&#8221;, you can call specific &#8220;values&#8221; for each item. An example of something you might want to put into a plain-text dictionary would be a rating system:</p>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 300px;\">\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\" />\n<col style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\" /> </colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">Rating</th>\n<th style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">Number</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">Poor</td>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">Marginal</td>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">Acceptable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">Good</td>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">Best</td>\n<td style=\"width: 100px; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you are given a descriptor of &#8220;Acceptable&#8221;, you can understand this numerically on a 1-5 scale. Using a table is great for viewing. But if you want to actually <em>use</em> that data, then changing the table to a plain-text dictionary will allow you to pull information out of it based on a search string.</p>\n<h3>Entering Dictionaries</h3>\n<p>Plain-text dictionaries follow the following format:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin: 50px; width: 200; padding: 25px;\">{\"key 1\":\"value 1\",\n\"key 2\":\"value 2\",\n.\n.\n.\n\"key n\":\"value n\"}\n</pre>\n<p>For every line, you&#8217;ll need to follow the quotes, colons, and commas exactly as above for it to work.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> So for the example Markdown table above, I can write that in plain text like so:</p>\n<pre style=\"margin: 50px; width: 175; padding: 25px;\">{\"Poor\":\"1\",\n\"Marginal\":\"2\",\n\"Acceptable\":\"3\",\n\"Good\":\"4\",\n\"Best\":\"5\"}\n</pre>\n<p>Once you have everything in that format, you can place this simple dictionary either as a text block or a <code>.txt</code> file that you can call out of iCloud Drive or Dropbox in Workflow.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Workflow on the App Store\" href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter\">Workflow</a> also has the capability of entering in a dictionary. Workflow asks for different types of values; it can get complex, and I&#8217;m not going to cover that here. But to enter this simple dictionary, we can use the <code>Dictionary</code> step as follows:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Workflow-Dictionary-Input.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Once completed for any of the methods \u2014 <code>Text</code> <code>Get File</code> or <code>Dictionary</code> action blocks \u2014 be sure to include a <code>Set Variable</code> step so that you can call it later.</p>\n<p>Personally, while Workflow is very powerful for this type of thing, I would prefer to enter my dictionaries in plain-text form. This allows me to duplicate workflows more easily while calling a different directory. It also means that I can edit them quickly in a text editor like <a title=\"Drafts on the App Store\" href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter\">Drafts</a> and save them. What I do for files in Drafts is use the <code>[[title]]</code> for the name of the file and <code>[[body]]</code> for the dictionary, like so:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Workflow-Drafts-Array-Entry.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Pulling Out Information</h3>\n<p>Now that the dictionary is set, we can pull out specific information. For example, you can call out a list of the keys you have stored in the dictionary. Once the dictionary is called using the <code>Get Dictionary From Input</code> step, place a <code>Get Dictionary Value</code> block with <code>All Keys</code> selected. What this will do is provide a list of the keys, which you can call using a <code>Choose From List</code> block. One thing that calling dictionaries doesn&#8217;t do well is give you the values the way you have them stored. For example, the stored rating list is presented like so:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rating-System-List.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The list is out of order. Unfortunately this is an inherent thing with dictionaries, and slightly aggravating to someone like myself who likes things orderly. However, there is a small thing that can be done: using a <code>Filter Files</code> block after the <code>Get Dictionary Values</code>, you can sort by <code>Name</code> and select <code>A \u2192 Z</code>; this sorts the list alphabetically, which is more helpful to find what you&#8217;re looking for instead of a random list.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Filter-Files-Block-Sort.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Then, set that chosen value as a variable. This will become the variable that you look up in the dictionary. Use the <code>Get Variable</code> and <code>Get Dictionary From Input</code> blocks to call it again, along with a <code>Get Dictionary Value</code>. This time, however, use <code>Value</code> and put in your search variable in the <code>Key</code> field. This will search the dictionary for the given key, and give you the value associated with it. What you do with that value is up to you.</p>\n<p>Here is the <a title=\"Rating System Workflow\" href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/6b946072d5244ec7b985bc7aa93034b3\">rating system workflow</a> in its entirety:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rating-System-Workflow.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Say I switch companies and start using a different rating scale that goes from 1 &#8211; 10, along with a change in descriptors.

            "content_text": "Normally when I have an idea, I&#8217;ll write about it. This past time, I decided to do something a bit different, and write more about how I felt rather than explain it. But, I also realize that this new-to-me idea might need a bit of help and guidance for those that aren&#8217;t well versed in the subject, like me. So I&#8217;ll do my best here to explain.\n\nFull disclosure: I&#8217;m not a programmer, I&#8217;m not a developer, I&#8217;m not an expert. So don&#8217;t rely on this post for complex methods.\nDictionaries\nIn simple terms, dictionaries are a place to store information in a tabular-like format, similar to a database or an array.1 The difference with dictionaries is that they use key/value pairs: using &#8220;keys&#8221;, you can call specific &#8220;values&#8221; for each item. An example of something you might want to put into a plain-text dictionary would be a rating system:\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRating\nNumber\n\n\n\n\nPoor\n1\n\n\nMarginal\n2\n\n\nAcceptable\n3\n\n\nGood\n4\n\n\nBest\n5\n\n\n\nIf you are given a descriptor of &#8220;Acceptable&#8221;, you can understand this numerically on a 1-5 scale. Using a table is great for viewing. But if you want to actually use that data, then changing the table to a plain-text dictionary will allow you to pull information out of it based on a search string.\nEntering Dictionaries\nPlain-text dictionaries follow the following format:\n{\"key 1\":\"value 1\",\n\"key 2\":\"value 2\",\n.\n.\n.\n\"key n\":\"value n\"}\n\nFor every line, you&#8217;ll need to follow the quotes, colons, and commas exactly as above for it to work.2 So for the example Markdown table above, I can write that in plain text like so:\n{\"Poor\":\"1\",\n\"Marginal\":\"2\",\n\"Acceptable\":\"3\",\n\"Good\":\"4\",\n\"Best\":\"5\"}\n\nOnce you have everything in that format, you can place this simple dictionary either as a text block or a .txt file that you can call out of iCloud Drive or Dropbox in Workflow.\nWorkflow also has the capability of entering in a dictionary. Workflow asks for different types of values; it can get complex, and I&#8217;m not going to cover that here. But to enter this simple dictionary, we can use the Dictionary step as follows:\n\nOnce completed for any of the methods \u2014 Text Get File or Dictionary action blocks \u2014 be sure to include a Set Variable step so that you can call it later.\nPersonally, while Workflow is very powerful for this type of thing, I would prefer to enter my dictionaries in plain-text form. This allows me to duplicate workflows more easily while calling a different directory. It also means that I can edit them quickly in a text editor like Drafts and save them. What I do for files in Drafts is use the [[title]] for the name of the file and [[body]] for the dictionary, like so:\n\nPulling Out Information\nNow that the dictionary is set, we can pull out specific information. For example, you can call out a list of the keys you have stored in the dictionary. Once the dictionary is called using the Get Dictionary From Input step, place a Get Dictionary Value block with All Keys selected. What this will do is provide a list of the keys, which you can call using a Choose From List block. One thing that calling dictionaries doesn&#8217;t do well is give you the values the way you have them stored. For example, the stored rating list is presented like so:\n\nThe list is out of order. Unfortunately this is an inherent thing with dictionaries, and slightly aggravating to someone like myself who likes things orderly. However, there is a small thing that can be done: using a Filter Files block after the Get Dictionary Values, you can sort by Name and select A \u2192 Z; this sorts the list alphabetically, which is more helpful to find what you&#8217;re looking for instead of a random list.\n\nThen, set that chosen value as a variable. This will become the variable that you look up in the dictionary. Use the Get Variable and Get Dictionary From Input blocks to call it again, along with a Get Dictionary Value. This time, however, use Value and put in your search variable in the Key field. This will search the dictionary for the given key, and give you the value associated with it. What you do with that value is up to you.\nHere is the rating system workflow in its entirety:\n\nSay I switch companies and start using a different rating scale that goes from 1 &#8211; 10, along with a change in descriptors. I can simply go to my draft, edit the plain text, save the file, and I&#8217;m all set; there&#8217;s nothing to change in the workflow.\nReminders Example\nI&#8217;ve been using Reminders a lot more lately for tasks. The Siri input is really great from the iPhone and the Watch. But there are times that I need to be silent, and can&#8217;t say &#8220;Siri, remind me to [do something] when I get [home/work/etc].&#8221; I&#8217;ve been using this workflow for a while to do just that.\nHowever, I can have one master contact file for frequent addresses I might need, and use it for two purposes:\n\nA Route to Address workflow that allows me to select a location, and route directly there.\nUse that same location file to select a location for use in a modification of the Reminders workflow above.\n\nWhile these workflows are different in what they produce, at the core, they call the same information to be used in different ways.\n\nAdvantages\nThrough the Reminders example, you can start to realize the big benefit of using the plain-text dictionaries stored in your file system: using one file in multiple workflows.3 I can change the text file one time, and my workflows will pull in the updated information when it runs.
