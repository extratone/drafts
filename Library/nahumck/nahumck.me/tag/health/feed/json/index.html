This is due to bad habits that I&#8217;ve maintained over a number of years: stress eating, bored eating, poor portion control, poor diet, not enough exercise etc. The long story short is that I don&#8217;t do enough to monitor myself and don&#8217;t exercise nearly enough; I&#8217;m not doing a good enough job at taking care of me.</p>\n<p>In admitting to myself that I have a problem, I talked about this with Seth on our podcast where I told him that <a title=\"Fundamentally Broken Episode 008 - I Eat My Feelings\" href=\"http://podcast.fundamentallybroken.men/8\">I eat my feelings</a>. And while I understand that a lot of people do this, it&#8217;s not a sustainable thing for me to do.
