										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s fall &#8211; damn near winter &#8211; and that can only mean one thing: time to make my task management more complicated. I often use the summer to make my life <a href="https://nahumck.me/basic/">simple</a>, and then spend some time making things <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">overly</span> complicated. I&#8217;m always looking for a better way to handle my tasks. I&#8217;ve tried many task managers, and had gone through all of them. Or so I thought. I&#8217;ve had a few people suggest some apps to me, and I often think: <em>do I really need another app</em>? Apparently, the answer is yes. But this time <em>feels</em> different.</p>
<p>Enter <a title="GoodTask" href="http://goodtaskapp.com/index.html">GoodTask</a>.<br />
<span id="more-1216"></span><br />
There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here. I know I won’t cover everything possible, but I&#8217;ll do my best to tell you why it’s important to me now. First and foremost, GoodTask &#8211; available for both <a title="GoodTask 3 for iOS" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1068039220?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">iOS</a> and <a title="GoodTask 3 for macOS" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-3/id1143437985?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">macOS</a> &#8211; is build upon Reminders. It uses the Reminders integration and provides very fast sync across devices and with the integrations themselves; in fact, I usually see a task show up in a second or less when I use <em>Hey, Siri</em>. The benefit here is that my tasks don&#8217;t need to have a separate, proprietary sync engine: it can use native sync with all the benefits therein.</p>
<p>The iOS app is free, with a $5 in-app purchase to unlock the power features. While you can try the app, you don’t really get to experience the full app without buying the IAP.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> I’m using the best parts of GoodTask: <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help13.html">the URL scheme</a>, themes (dark mode!), <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help7.html">text snippets</a>, and <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help10.html">quick actions</a>. I&#8217;m not using the notifications, however; I&#8217;m still using Reminders for that aspect because notifications persist. Additionally, because I’m a big fan of the <a title="Keep It Simple" href="https://nahumck.me/keep-it-simple/">Siri Watch Face</a>, my tasks are surfaced there without having to use a different app on the watch. The GoodTask watch app isn’t as good as something like <a title="Things 3 for iPhone and Apple Watch" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Things</a>, but it does allow you to see your tasks and add a new one from your wrist. In general, I’m adding tasks in other ways; if I have to add a task from my watch, I find it much easier to use Siri to do so. And that&#8217;s a benefit of using tight integration with Reminders: I get all the benefits of a highly-functional app while using all the benefits of a native solution. There really is no down side here.</p>
<p>There are some additional benefits that GoodTask provides over Reminders. Search in Reminders is great, but GoodTask goes the extra step to have Smart Lists to create saved searches. This goes back to an aspect of what I <a href="https://nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do/">loved about 2Do</a>, and is something that I&#8217;ve missed while trying other apps as well. I can search text, tags, etc. to compile what I need to view across my tasks. The repeat options are the the same as Reminders, with one notable exception: repeat after completion. I really like using this option for tasks like specific cleaning, furnace filters, and other things that need to be completed with a frequency but have the flexibility of when I do them.</p>
<p>There are two unique ways that you can speed up task entry. First, you can setup customizable quick actions. These quick actions can be dates, times, time intervals, tags, etc.; there are even quick actions to set up repetitive tasks. I have a few set up for dropping off or picking up prescriptions, dry cleaning, and some other work-related tasks that aren’t regularly repeating, but occur frequently enough to have a quick entry option. The second quick-entry feature is user-defined text snippets. While it isn’t full natural language parsing, it greatly speeds up entry. You can add “Wednesday 7p” and it will set the date and time without having to select each one in the regular fields of the task. You can customize the snippets to work for you, using common words or other shorthand to enter your tasks quickly.</p>

<p>The developers at have come up with a way of storing extra information to provide greater functionality than the built in Reminders.app: by using the notes field of the task, they can add details about the reminder that GT parses. Because of this clever use of the field, the app can provide tags and subtasks: <code>#tags</code> have a simple syntax, where subtasks follow a more complex format of</p>
<p><code>..gt3[{"Subtasks":["0SubTask1","0SubTask2",...,"0SubTaskN"]}]gt3</code>.</p>
<p>With that syntax in the notes field, GoodTask will read that information and treat it like a checklist.</p>
<p>Knowing the syntax of the subtasks and realizing that it can be read by adding text to the note field, I can start opening up some automation possibilities. When I started looking into moving some things over, I quickly realized that I can simply use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quick-capture/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> for <a href="https://nahumck.me/trusted-capture-with-drafts/">trusted capture</a>, just as I always have.</p>
<p>I set up an action with Drafts that sends over a task via the Smart Add functionality of <a href="http://goodtaskapp.com/help13.html">the URL scheme</a>. When using Smart Add, the text snippets you type automatically expand and populate items. So when I look at <a title="Carrot Weather" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">the weather</a> and see that it will rain in the morning, I can quickly open up Drafts, type &#8220;Take Umbrella tomorrow morning alert&#8221;, and send a reminder into GoodTask; it will receive the text, parse the text snippets, and create a &#8220;Take Umbrella&#8221; reminder with due time of 7:00am that will trigger an alert.</p>
<p>That action is great for moving a single task or a selection over, but what about a list? This is where knowing the syntax really helps. I wanted to move my house list over to GT. It&#8217;s a list of a plethora of items <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that I don&#8217;t have time to complete</span>. For a while, I&#8217;ve been using Drafts to store all of those types of lists. I&#8217;ve split it up now, with longer-term projects (like remodeling) residing in Notes and the remainder in a regular list.</p>
<p>Some of the tasks I have around the house are actually small projects, or a task with a few subtasks. Now that I know how the syntax works, I made a <a title="GT3 Subtasks" href="https://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/k/2Ht">subtask creation key</a> that takes a group of lines and turns it into the proper syntax for GT to accept.<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Then, I simply put each main task in the format <code>task|note</code> so that I could use <a href="http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1C6">this action</a> that moved it over into Reminders. Here&#8217;s a small example:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1215" data-permalink="https://nahumck.me/goodtask-3-an-unexpected-surprise/image-11-12-17-9-51-am-png/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2048,1536" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1" class="size-full wp-image-1215 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Image-11-12-17-9-51-AM.png?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Again, the benefit here is using the backbone of the Reminders integrations. The input of the tasks from Drafts to Reminders is simple; the syntax that GoodTask uses to parse subtasks and tags allows for even better integration when using GoodTask as the manager. There are also numerous other possibilities for task entry. Users of <a title="Fantastical for iPad" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-ipad/id830708155?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Fantastical</a> are able to use NLP to send tasks into Reminders, which in turn would show up in GoodTask. I can use Siri to add a simple task. I could use <a title="Workflow" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Workflow</a> to create a task from the widget or the watch. I can use the Share Sheet to select Reminders, and input a task in that way. There are a ton of ways to enter my tasks.</p>
<p>There are some weaknesses, but they are small: I can’t use drag/drop to add a message in the same way I can in the Reminders app; I also can’t view a note when I use the “remind me of this later” feature of Siri.<sup><a id="ffn3" class="footnote" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> I’d really like to see 3D Touch and drag/drop improvements for the iOS app, automatic theme options for day/night based on location, and better visual indications for tags. I’d also like to have my view state saved by list, so that I can better view my tasks in each list; my all tasks list would likely be a week view, while my individual lists would be a list view so that I can see all of them. The basis for all of these things are there, and it will just take a bit of effort to incorporate them. Judging from the emails I’ve sent in and the quick responses from the developer, I’m guessing these things are coming soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking to the future of this app, and I feel like I have found a solution where I can get all of the benefits of a power-user app while keeping the native aspects I wanted. GoodTask is the perfect blend of what I need: it&#8217;s a powerhouse tool when it needs to be while giving me all the benefits of the Reminders integrations that proliferate throughout iOS for easy task entry. Until Apple does an <a href="https://nahumck.me/rethinking-reminders/">overhaul of Reminders</a>, this will serve as a phenomenal surrogate.</p>
<ol id="footnotes">
<li id="fn1">My hope is that in the future, the developer will allow a 2-week trial similar to other productivity apps so that you can really understand the full potential of the app. <a href="#ffn1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn2">I’m not a programmer, so the key isn’t perfect. It will take separate lines and group them in the syntax. If you don’t highlight the lines, it will input some text. If I was better at this stuff, it would be improved. But, it’s what I know how to do. <a href="#ffn2"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn3">Which works about 10% of the time and is frustrating as all hell. <a href="#ffn3"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of Apple’s fundamental strengths is creating software for the masses. You may scoff at this remark, but it’s true. Look at the ubiquity of Messages, Mail, and Notes: there are other apps out there for power users, apps that offer greater functionality, and apps that have better design elements in place.</p>
<p>And while there could be improvements to a lot of what Apple creates in their software, they have been getting better at creating apps that most users will want to use. If we take the example of Notes, we can see the potential Apple has for creating great software for most users. With the added features in iOS <a title="iOS 10: The MacStories Review - Notes" href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-10-the-macstories-review/20/#notes">10</a> and <a title="iOS 11: The MacStories Review - Notes" href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/8/#notes">11</a>, Notes has become a powerhouse app while maintaining the usability for everyone. Over time, Music and Podcasts have gotten better.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Mail isn’t great, but that might be more a function of email and email providers rather than Mail itself. But one of the most useful apps on iOS is in dire need of a refresh, a reimagining, and a glorious rebirth.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reminders.</em></strong><br />
<span id="more-1197"></span></p>
<h3>Task Management for All</h3>
<p>It’s no secret that I love task management and task management software. And given that I’ve tried a bunch of software, I’d like to think that I have some perspective on the subject. I think a lot of people’s lives can be improved by task management. For years, I’ve tried to get family and friends to see the benefits; sometimes they do, most times they don’t. But that doesn’t stop me from trying.</p>
<p>What I have often found is that the idea of downloading a separate app bothers people. Sure, they’ll have a few dozen free apps &#8211; camera and photo editing apps, several social media apps, a bunch of couponing apps &#8211; but heaven forbid they get a paid productivity app involved in the mix. The mental friction of having a separate app to manage their lives can be difficult to get over. This is usually the point where I suggest simply using Reminders: it’s basic enough to get the job done, it’s a part of the OS, and they don’t have to pay to try it out. But the app isn’t where it needs to be.</p>
<p>Apple could take Reminders forward as a key app in the ecosystem if they wanted to do it. And it’s not too far off now that iOS 11 has been released. Reminders can improve in a lot of ways to support further use of the app without taking away from its simplicity. It can be made into more of a task management system with some small changes to the layout and features, all while keeping it simple and easy to use. Sure, there might be some better options out there like <a title="OmniFocus for iOS " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">OmniFocus</a>, Things for <a title="Things for iPhone and Apple Watch " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">iPhone</a>/<a title="Things for iPad " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">iPad</a>, <a title="2Do for iOS " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">2Do</a>, or <a title="Todoist for iOS " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todoist-organize-your-life/id572688855?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Todoist</a>; but each of those options are for different levels and styles of task management, and can be difficult to onboard with someone who has never used a complex app before.</p>
<p>What I can envision for Reminders is a blending of the some commonly used features for these apps, and doing what they do best — create a version that, while not first, is nearly equal to alternatives and is natively a part of the OS. And it can do all this while maintaining one of its own strengths: being native. There are some simple features that could be added without much of a problem, while others might take some re-thinking and redesign in the future.</p>
<h3>New Layout and Aesthetic</h3>
<p>There are many changes I would like to visually see, as well as adding some new features. Doing so would not only help this app excel, but also by extension help the user better understand his/her tasks and aid in a true task management system. First things first: take the linen paper background and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">burn</span> recycle all of it.<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> In the UI refresh of iOS 11 and the move to the Editorial-style layouts, I am surprised to see Reminders be left behind. It’s dated, serves no purpose, and really limits the possibilities of the interface going forward. If we look at something more modern, say Files or Mail, there are many positive things that Reminders could borrow from its native counterparts: the dedicated side bar and its behavior, sort states that could be modified to fit the task management paradigm, and there is enough space to have clarity and utilize the space to push an updated UI that works for lists and tasks.</p>

<p>Now that we have a better canvas to work with, the view into your task management can be changed. For the most part, keeping lists separate can still work; in fact, for non-power users, this is likely a preferred method of seeing tasks; in a compact view or slide over, it would present in the same way. For power users like myself, I often want to see all of my tasks at once. Sure, you can keep a separate list of your tasks in another app like <a title="Drafts 4 for iOS " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quick-capture/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> or Notes and move them over when you need them; but using a system like this (as I’m <a title="Keep It Simple - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/keep-it-simple/">currently doing</a>) is a bandaid. It would be nice to keep all of this information in one place.</p>

<p>I think Apple can accomplish this by utilizing system lists, like that of the Scheduled list. It could be in its own section of the app, similar to how Favorites is contained in Files. By adding an All Tasks list, the user can see all of their tasks presented to them. There would be headings for each list, denoted by their color, which separate the tasks; additionally, these can be foldable headings to minimize what is in view. This would also enable drag/drop within the full task view between lists without having to leave the current view. In the future, allowing for the addition of user-generated Smart Lists would be a huge benefit to those with many tasks. There could also be a completed and recently deleted task item for the times you make a mistake so you can recover your work, or if you really want to see what you have completed along the way.</p>

<p>By providing a more modern design, Reminders can have the simplicity it has today while expanding its capability. The utilization of space and information density can be increased with the new UI, while still maintaining the most basic task management. Some of the existing interface for lists can be carried over, namely the color and sharing interface. The task editing can remain the same, but can be presented in an iOS 11 style. It no longer would make Reminders the bastard child on iOS, but would make it part of the new iOS family.</p>
<p>By giving the user an opportunity to view their entire task management structure, it will allow a more-than-casual task management aficionado to really power through a review of what is going on with their entire life, all while using a native solution on iOS that integrates with the entire system.</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>Another power-user feature that could be added in an elegant way would be the use of tags. This is already present in Files, and I think presenting consistency across apps would be a huge win for everyone. The tags would be listed off to the side with their color/name; in a single view, these could be shown like a traditional list.</p>
<p>The advantage of having these items laid out in this way is that it also gives a view (or a perspective) based on a tag when selected. If you could have a person or a place as a tag, this could be useful for when you see someone or near a place; it could further be expanded by allowing a tag to have a contact or address applied, ideally using drag and drop. Having the ability to filter your tasks on a tag brings a power-like feature to casual users. Additionally, searching in spotlight for a specific tag would also present items in Files, Reminders, and — if it were added — Notes. The user would only have to remember the name of the tag to find what he/she needed across the system.</p>
<p>When in a view with a sidebar, a user could drag a task over to a tag and apply it, just as in Files. The frameworks for creating these options are already there: they just need to be applied to Reminders.</p>
<h3>Drag and Drop</h3>
<p>Speaking of drag and drop, I would love to be able to drag anything over to be reminded of it. Think of the “Hey Siri, remind me of this” feature, but without using the voice. I can do this already with a link from Safari or an email. But what about a specific Note? Dragging over a specific note currently copies the entire text contents of the note, rather than a link back to the note itself; I can, however, ask Siri to remind me of this note later, and a link to the specific note is inserted. The difference in behaviors is maddening. Unifying them, or at the very least presenting a user with the option to import a link to the note or the text using a contextual menu, is better for the user in every way.</p>

<p>Additionally, drag and drop could bring some other features into Reminders. The ability to add documents, images, etc. to any task is now possible thanks to drag and drop. Having the option to add additional contextual information to a task would be immensely helpful. Need to get a grocery store item, but want to make sure you get the right thing? Now you can take a picture, and drag it right onto the task; the image would be added into the notes section of the task. Want to be reminded to take action on a specific file? Simply drag it from Files, and a rich link to the file would be created. You can tie the important information into a task from multiple sources across the system.</p>

<h3>Other Features</h3>
<p>Sorting is badly needed in Reminders. The UI elements are there today in Files, and they could be presented in Reminders in the same fashion. Having the ability to sort lists based on due dates, priority, tags, and name are basic functions that any good task manager should provide. If they are provided in other Apple apps, why not this one?</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1194" data-permalink="https://nahumck.me/rethinking-reminders/image-4-gif/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-4.gif?fit=500%2C79&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="500,79" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-4.gif?fit=300%2C47&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-4.gif?fit=500%2C79&amp;ssl=1" class="size-full wp-image-1194 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Image-4.gif?w=375&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The repeat features of Reminders have been greatly improved over the years, but there’s room for improvement. Most 3rd-party applications have options for repeat after completion, weekday/weekends, and other custom repeats. Going forward, having a pause option for repeating tasks<sup><a id="ffn3" class="footnote" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> would be a fantastic feature to implement; it is a great feature for the user going on vacation.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the biggest benefits to making these changes in Reminders is the additional benefits of a native solution. This will play well with Siri, the Siri watch face, and all of Apple’s 1st-party apps. I don’t have to figure out how to mispronounce the name of the app I’m using, I can just speak what I need to do. It can utilize all of the newest frameworks and APIs that Apple releases. It also means that some of the existing features, like list sharing, and can be applied to tasks as well. How great would it be to have native, 1st-party collaboration for task management right out of the box in iOS?</p>
<p>I could go deeper into this, but I’m leaving a lot open for Apple to figure out. The mockups that I have created — all using <a title="Pixelmator" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id924695435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Pixelmator</a> on iOS — are just a start of what could be; I would love to see some small UI differentiation while still maintaining the overall aesthetic that is found throughout iOS. Maybe they have a better solution in mind, but I hope that they take some key elements from amazing tasks management apps out there, while simultaneously combining it into their own solution that works across the operating system. It needs a functional and visual overhaul, and with the new Editorial UI that has been put into the system, now is the time to make that change.</p>
<p>Presenting new users with a deep-linking paradigm in a non-complex manner will help them better understand what is possible with their operating system and allow them to explore new options. Giving users the options to view their tasks in multiple ways by making things extensible using existing system-level interactions is the best way forward for Reminders. If it is built into the system from the start, there’s a better chance that users will utilize its functionality to enhance their lives, which is something that Apple as a whole strives to do with their products.</p>
<p>It’s time to rethink Reminders and give it the update it so desperately needs and deserves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After my big work trip, I immediately loaded the betas of iOS 11 and watchOS 4. I spent the whole summer showing restraint, and I just couldn’t wait any longer. So I backed everything up fully — once to iCloud and once to iTunes — and loaded them on.</p>
<p>What I’ve noticed in two weeks is that there are some small, subtle changes in a few key areas that have a very large and profound impact on how I use my devices. And some of them are really, really great. It’s brought me back to a place I’ve flirted with before, but now I can see my tasks with a new perspective and with a renewed focus. And it started with trying out iOS 11…<br />

<p>Fairly recently, I <a href="https://nahumck.me/perfectly-mobile/">got an iPad Pro</a>. It changed a lot about how I use my devices, my workflows, and elevated my productivity. I was able to get a lot of things done before; now, with iOS 11, I’ve never been more productive. Having iOS 11 on my iPad is like having an Aston Martin DB11 and adding all of the James Bond gadgets you can handle; it becomes a much more capable machine without changing its form.</p>
<p>The multitasking has taken some getting used to, but I’m constantly flying between spaces and slide over. I’m using different apps in slide over depending on the mode or context I’m in (think social, productivity, finance, etc.), but it feels very freeing now that I have somewhat of a handle on it. As time goes on, I’m sure that feeling will increase even more.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more with iOS 11 &#8211; like the new on-screen keyboard that has the flick gesture that I want on the iPhone too &#8211; but I’m going to let that be done by the <a title="iOS 11 - The MacStories Review" href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-11-the-macstories-review/">professionals</a>.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> The good news of loading on the beta is that I no longer have a desire to figure out how to sell the 9.7” iPad Pro to get the improved 10.5” model. This thing handles everything that I throw at it, and I don’t have to jump through hoops to get there, which makes me happy.</p>
<p>Management of my tasks is now primarily done on the iPad; there are so many times that split screen has been a godsend for my productivity, and that is the most true when it comes to my daily task management. Having a good watch face to help me through my day had been pretty great before. I often used the Modular face with my task manager’s useful complication and watch app. But with iOS 11 comes watchOS 4, and now there’s a better way…</p>
<h2>Siri Apple Watch Face</h2>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1177" data-permalink="https://nahumck.me/keep-it-simple/image-9-16-17-8-48-am-png/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?fit=484%2C872&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="484,872" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?fit=167%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?fit=484%2C872&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="484" height="872" class="size-full wp-image-1177 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?resize=484%2C872&#038;ssl=1" style="max-width:200px;" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?w=484&amp;ssl=1 484w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?resize=167%2C300&amp;ssl=1 167w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I’ll admit, when I first saw the watchOS 4 portion of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665?mt=2">Apple Keynote</a>, I wasn’t really blown away by everything. As I started working out, there are were some small improvements to how the workout app behaves on the watch. And when I loaded the beta on my Watch, I discovered that I was enamored with the Siri watch face.</p>
<p>A while ago, I created a <a href="https://nahumck.me/second-screen/">Today workflow</a>: this workflow would pull all of the information from my calendars, tasks, etc. and put it into my focus for the day. The problem with that was always this: I had to go seek the information, i.e. run the workflow. What I had always wanted was that information to automatically surface when I needed it. What I really needed was an assistant to get me my information and send it to me. I tried using Slack and IFTTT to help me with that, but it never seemed to work out the way I thought it should.</p>
<p>Now I have the Siri Watch Face. It brings up my calendar, the weather, the sunrise/sunset all in the order it’s happening. It still doesn’t bring up my tasks, at least not where I had them.<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> I would love to see 3rd-party integrations for task managers or other calendars, weather apps like <a title="Carrot Weather for iOS " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Carrot Weather</a> or <a title="Weather Atlas for iOS " href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-atlas-weather-radar-map-10-day-forecast/id1196015787?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Weather Atlas</a>, and even an Activity card to keep track of my progress throughout the day. Opening this up to the 3rd-party ecosystem will bring powerful new tools to the user, and allow the user to use their default applications in a new way to benefit their daily lives.</p>
<p>Overall, the Siri Watch Face is really fantastic, but there’s one thing that would make it even better: <em>surfacing</em> my tasks for me. And to do this, I need one more thing…</p>
<h2>Reminders + Drafts</h2>
<p>I’ve been down a road like this <a href="https://nahumck.me/basic/">before</a>. And there were some things about it previously that didn’t work for me. But there are a lot of things that have improved with the new operating system updates.</p>
<p>What I realized was that although having a dedicated task management app like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do-reminders-personal-planner/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">2Do</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">OmniFocus</a>, or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Things</a> to house everything can be helpful, I really don’t need to have a complex system. What I needed was a place to house a large list, and then a way to move some of those things that are ready into my focus and apply some triggers (reminders) to execute my next actions. I don’t need a complex set of nested folders and lists; after all, I used to use a piece of paper and a pen for all of this stuff. After I sat down to figure this all out, I ended up just needing a more simple list structure: my master lists in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes-share-anywhere/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Drafts</a> which provide my areas of focus, my Inbox in Reminders for focus on next actions, and my recurring list in Reminders for when I need nudges for medicine, trash, and the like. And this setup works extremely well for me on the iPad Pro in split screen.</p>

<p>There are some challenges to using it in this way: how can I see everything that relates to my Home list now that it’s split between Reminders and Drafts? Tagging. While I wish that Reminders would get the ability for tags as has been done in Files, I’ll have to run with my own solution for now. It’s something that I’ve seen before,<sup><a id="ffn3" class="footnote" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> and it should help me with a lot of what I’m doing. For each list, I’ll tag it with a <code>x[tag]</code> format: for home, it will be <code>xhome</code>; for podcast stuff, it will be <code>xpodcast</code>. I’ll apply this to the items in my master lists and also the reminders that I pull into my inbox. I can then use Spotlight search to view everything related to that; within the apps, I can search for them. In Drafts, I have a filter created to search for <code>xtasks</code>, which I have put in each focus list I have. It’s a bit more work to type those tags in, but it’s going to be extremely useful going forward when I need to find something quickly.</p>
<p>Previously, I tried using Drafts + Reminders.app. I would send tasks over via actions and then apply the date/time to get them done. And while that could have worked then, for one reason or another it didn’t. But now that I’m a little older and little wiser, my mind has been opened slightly and I’m learning about how I operate; what I’ve come to realize is that I need simplicity. So with that in mind, now I can highlight my next actions/tasks in Drafts and drag/drop them into Reminders. From there, I can set all the things I need to do.</p>
<p>Now, I know what you’re thinking: <em>why not use Notes for your lists? That has a lot to offer: search, formatting, rich links, images, etc. That seems like a better solution.</em> And you’re right. Well, for now you’re right. Part of why I want to keep Drafts as my repository for the lists is because I want to future-proof my plan. And I’m hopeful that syntax highlighting comes to Drafts sooner rather than later. On the image below, I have the same list in Drafts and <a title="Ulysses for iOS" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ">Ulysses</a>, just to show the difference it can make. The visual difference between the two is important. Now I can navigate through my lists with ease. So in the short term, I’ll live with the syntax the way it looks in hopes that the next version of Drafts supports this so that it makes my life easier. If for whatever reason it doesn’t, the good news is that Drafts is extensible enough and I can share this into Notes without a problem.</p>

<p>If in the future I need to expand my lists, I just simply need to create a new area of focus, tag the list appropriately, and add tasks to my Inbox in Reminders. From there, I just have to utilize my watch to help me get things accomplished. The system is good for small amounts, and I’m sure it can handle even my complex projects with ease.<sup><a id="ffn4" class="footnote" href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>What it comes back down to is using Drafts as a central place of capture, something I have <a title="Trusted Capture with Drafts" href="https://nahumck.me/trusted-capture-with-drafts/">utilized before</a>. My system has changed once again, but here it is that Drafts is at its core. This small little thing has reduced the mental friction of “where does this go”. I know where it goes. It goes in the place where all of my thoughts start. I might need to send it to another place — via an action, with drag/drop, or simple copy/paste — and then attach a reminder, but that’s ok. I can do that sort of thing on the fly without having to worry about where to start it. And for someone that can often get overwhelmed with how much there is to do with all that life throws at me, knowing that I can start in Drafts is a huge key to any success I have with my <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tasks</span> life. Using Drafts in conjunction with native apps has led to bigger and better things that I originally had planned.</p>
<p>I’m also reminded of something that <a title="Merlin Mann on Twitter" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/hotdogsladies">Merlin Mann</a> often says on his multitude of podcasts (paraphrasing):</p>
<blockquote><p>Try just talking to your dingus. Use Siri. Use the new features. Use the apps that you haven’t tried in a long time. A lot of this technology has improved with time.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right. Things have improved with the help of integrations over the years. And while I would absolutely <em>love</em> to see Reminders get the same awesome treatment that Notes has received, it’s still not going to have a ton of nit-picky settings that other task managers do.<sup><a id="ffn5" class="footnote" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> So I should try to use it the way things are intended so that I can see what I can get out of it. Does it mean that I’m going to be able to manage some complex stuff? No. But it can be awesome when you start working within the ecosystem to make it work for you. You might not have a flesh-and-blood assistant, but you can have a better digital one than you’ve had in the past. The more you use it, the more you figure out how to work with it, the more you are going to get out of having this virtual assistant on your wrist.</p>
<p>With all of these changes, I can now manage all my tasks using my iPad Pro or iPhone running iOS 11 &#8211; my master list in Drafts, my focus list and recurring tasks in Reminders &#8211; and have it all surface for me on my Apple Watch on the Siri watch face. It puts it all there for me to look at in one scrollable view so that I can make sure I’m focused on the right things. The information I’ve stored is being surfaced to me. I’m letting go of the preconceived notions I had about what I should be using, and thinking about the way I want to work. I’m pleasantly surprised by how well this is working, and it’s only been a couple of weeks. How long will this last? Who knows. But I really like where this all is headed. I think I’ll set a reminder for next September: “Hey Siri, remind me in September to keep it simple.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer opened my eyes to trying new things with task management. I had a great, wonderful system, <a title="Bifurcation - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/bifurcation">and then split it in two</a>. Then I <a title="Basic - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/basic">tried Reminders instead</a>, and loved it even more when I got my Apple Watch. And life as I knew it was going along just fine. Until something just felt off.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it. I was accomplishing what I needed, and there wasn&#8217;t really a hole in my system. Life had just gone from chaotic to simplistic. And maybe that&#8217;s why things felt wrong. I can&#8217;t explain why, but it just didn&#8217;t feel right anymore. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a bit of a sickness, but I have come to realize I need to have some complexity in my life.</p>
<p>So I started thinking of what to do next. Did I need to try a new system? I&#8217;ve tried <a title="OmniFocus for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">OmniFocus</a>, <a title="Things for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/things/id284971781?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Things</a>, <a title="Due for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/due-reminders-countdown-timers/id390017969?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Due</a>, etc. and nothing really stuck, despite those apps being great in their own ways. I thought about what made the Reminders experiment so great: the simplicity. But yet, when I needed to look at everything going on, it was cumbersome at best. I tried to make something work, but it just felt wrong to me. So maybe it wasn&#8217;t a problem of the tools I have and what I&#8217;m using, but rather <em>how</em> I&#8217;m using them (or not).</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s led me to a strange, crazy place.<br />
<span id="more-945"></span></p>
<h2>The New System</h2>
<p>So, this system I&#8217;ve developed uses four — yes, you read that right, four — different applications: Drafts, Reminders, Fantastical, and 2Do. I know, I know: this is <em><strong>NUTS</strong></em>. Why on earth would anyone want to use FOUR apps when you can use ONE task management system? I&#8217;m clearly off my rocker here. But here&#8217;s the thing: it&#8217;s really using one task management system — Reminders — all while giving me the flexibility I want while keeping the simplicity. So let me break it down.</p>
<h3>Drafts</h3>
<p><a title="Drafts on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Drafts</a> is the place where a majority of my tasks start anyway. It may be something I&#8217;m quickly thinking of, it might be grocery items, it might be a one-off thing that my boss said I need to get done. But it still goes to Drafts first.</p>
<p>The beauty here is that it&#8217;s one main point for entry, with the exception of capturing anything with Siri. Now that I have my Apple Watch, I find myself using Siri to do just that, and I&#8217;ve realized I need to have some sort of Reminders integration into my system. And because Drafts can also hook into Reminders, it&#8217;s an integral part of the system, even beyond <a title="Articles about Drafts - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/tag/drafts/">everything else</a> that I use it for already.</p>
<h3>Fantastical</h3>
<p>One area where Reminders.app falls short is input. I have, for a long time, loved the natural language parsing (NLP) capability of <a title="Fantastical for iPhone on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Fantastical</a>. And I use that a lot for calendar entries for both work and home.</p>
<p>But one place I wasn&#8217;t using it before was for reminders. When I was using a dedicated app for task management before, I was using Dropbox to sync it all. I had a vastly different need then. I was using it for work and home, and Dropbox was the only way to have everything that I needed fully backed up if something bad were to happen to my device. But since I have made that split, my home task list became much easier to manage, and I don&#8217;t really need it.</p>
<p>Using NLP, I can send text from Drafts in a specific format to create a reminder at a specific time, set a repeat, set a list using the <code>/</code> followed by the list name, or even a priority by adding up to three <code>!</code> marks after it. The best part of this is that I can quickly take a list that I&#8217;ve entered into Drafts, add some key information about due dates/times, priority, or whatever &#8211; and send it along to get into my system. The parsing is flexible enough to handle the simple stuff all the way up to the more complex task entry.</p>
<h3>Reminders</h3>
<p>Reminders.app by itself is an OK app. There are a lot of improvements that could be made to make it better for most people &#8211; just like Apple did with Notes. But it does a <em>lot</em> of things really well. Notifications are really great with it because they stay persistent on the lock screen, even if I am turning on/off my screen; think of it like nagging alerts, but without the repeating sounds or occasional bugs of it not working. Reminders can really be what I need: simply a collection of lists, each with tasks that may or may not have a due date.</p>
<p>But the biggest power of using Reminders lies in the backbone that is the CalDav sync. And because Apple has made this something that developers can tap into, it allows you to use the simplicity of Reminders, while adding some layers of complexity if another app provides it. It allows me to enter in tasks from various sources, and have it show up in one place. And this is primarily how I was enjoying life since summer.</p>
<p>I still use the watch app to quickly check off a task, as the native watch app is really great. This may change in the future if a certain app gets a certain update that I want to see, but for now this is good enough for my wrist.</p>
<p>But the Reminders.app on the phone viewing wasn&#8217;t doing it for me. I needed to see everything in my system at once, and you simply can&#8217;t do that in Reminders. But, I know a few places that can. And that&#8217;s where an old friend comes in…</p>
<h3>2Do</h3>
<p>I have <a title="Move Your Thoughts to 2Do - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do">long loved</a> <a title="2Do for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do-reminders-personal-planner/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">2Do</a>, as you all well <a title="Articles on 2Do - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/tag/2do/">know</a>. And somewhere beginning in the fall, I decided to start trying other things. I wanted to try them to gain perspective, and because I truly want the app to be better; trying out other apps allows me to gain insight on how it improve something and make it even more vital to my system. And as Fahad can attest to by my numerous messages and lengthy notes on what I would love to see going forward in the app, my passion for it has not dwindled at all. In fact, some of the experimentation of other apps has actually made me appreciate it more. Recently with my uneasy feeling, I&#8217;ve been pulled back to 2Do more and more.</p>
<p>And so I was torn: I like a lot that Reminders has to offer, but I like a little more complexity like 2Do can provide. I like Reminders, I like Fantastical, I love 2Do. I like Drafts + Reminders, I love Drafts + Fantastical, I love Drafts + 2Do.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Drafts + Reminders.</li>
<li>Drafts + Fantastical.</li>
<li>Drafts + 2Do.</li>
<li>Drafts + Fantastical + Reminders + 2Do.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was the answer I was looking for, and I had it in my grasp at any point in time. 2Do has Reminders Sync capability. I previously was using Dropbox to get all of the benefits of 2Do, but now that my needs are simplified, it&#8217;s possible for me to use 2Do with Reminders Sync to bring the system together, without having to worry about <a title="Which Sync Method Should I Use? - 2doapp.com" href="http://www.2doapp.com/kb/article/which-sync-method-should-i-use.html">the caveats</a>. I get the benefits of Siri, Drafts, Fantastical, and 2Do, all in one system.</p>

<p>I think a big part of why this make so much sense to me is the GTD mentality of &#8220;review&#8221;. Using 2Do as the window into my tasks, and having the ability to tap an icon to view all of my lists at once, it&#8217;s basically the Review feature I was missing from my system. I tried to simulate this by keeping a big list in Drafts, but there are times that I need to have everything in one place, and using two different apps wasn&#8217;t working. I struggled to get my arms around it all, noticing that things would slip through here and there. I can also create <a title="Embracing Smart Lists - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do/#embracing-smart-lists">smart lists</a>, which can really bring it all together.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="943" data-permalink="https://nahumck.me/the-sum-of-the-parts/image-12-20-16-4-31-pm-1-jpeg/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?fit=1136%2C1006&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1136,1006" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="New System &#8211; Sorting A List" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C266&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?fit=1024%2C907&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-943 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=1100%2C974&#038;ssl=1" width="1100" height="974" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?w=1136&amp;ssl=1 1136w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C266&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C680&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C907&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I can also sort the tasks in my lists in 2Do, which is something greatly lacking in Reminders. I can look at the Scheduled view in Reminders.app, sorted by due date, but it&#8217;s not what I need from my other lists. There are times I want to see everything by priority or by a location or by due date. There are other times I want to take my entire list and focus on what&#8217;s really important. And using 2Do features on top of Reminders allows me that window into my life.</p>
<h2>A New Way Forward</h2>
<p>So, I now have Drafts as my entry point. Fantastical, Siri, and 2Do can handle the processing of tasks that I throw their way. Reminders will give me the notifications I need, except the badge count. And 2Do will give me the viewpoint into what the overall landscape of my personal task life will be, including the badge count, so I know if I haven&#8217;t gotten something done. And even though it sounds crazy to say that using four apps is better than using two, it&#8217;s 100% true for me. I&#8217;m entering tasks in a few different ways, being notified by persistent reminders, but my viewport into all of it is in one spot. And it&#8217;s a place I feel extremely comfortable in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using this system for only a short time. I&#8217;m sure that things will change. But I haven&#8217;t been this excited about my tasks in a while. Reminders is great, but it needed a little bit of help, and it came from an amazing, familiar place that I love. And even though I&#8217;m only a short time in — I can already tell that this is going to be something that I am extremely happy with for a while.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The sum of the parts really makes this system feel whole. It&#8217;s making me feel better about the things I&#8217;m doing. It&#8217;s helping me see what might have slipped my mind, or what glaring items I have that need to get done. It&#8217;s taken some time to get to this point, and I cannot believe that I wasn&#8217;t using this sooner. I guess all good things come to those who wait, right? I&#8217;m glad I took the time to wait for this to happen. And now starts the count of how long it will be until I change my mind again…</p>
<ol id="footnotes">
<li id="fn1">Until 2Do 4.0 happens. But, maybe even then, it won&#8217;t change my system much. Who knows. <a href="#ffn1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
