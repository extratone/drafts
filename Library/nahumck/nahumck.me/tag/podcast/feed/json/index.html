            "content_html": "<p>In my second appearance on <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/automators/73\">Automators</a> (part of the <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/\">Relay FM</a> network),<sup id=\"fnref-2049-first\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-first\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> I&#8217;m back to talk with David Sparks and Rosemary Orchard once again about <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts</a>. We dive in on some of the new stuff from <a href=\"https://nahumck.me/drafts-26-the-customization-update/\">version 26</a> which introduced custom themes and syntaxes. We also touch on a few other <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/misc/changelog-ios.html\">updates</a> from the first version to now as well. I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>There were a couple of things in the episode that I wanted to follow-up on here, including the homework assignment David gave me. I&#8217;m thrilled that the time spent with David and Rosemary gave me the idea, which made me reconsider some things with my personal journaling and changed how I&#8217;m doing it going forward.<br />\n<span id=\"more-2049\"></span></p>\n<h3>Theme Switching with Workspaces</h3>\n<p>Ever since I&#8217;ve used workspaces + action groups to create what I called modules, I&#8217;ve used a script actions to switch between them. Originally, I set each workspace, action group, and keyboard row individually; once the action and keyboard group options were added to the workspace manager, I simplified the actions. I keep the single action in every one of my action groups which I use in the keyboard row to use on the iPhone for quick access to switch. Where I use this switching method a lot is on my iPad, using a hardware keyboard. All of my modules are brought up with keyboard shortcuts, assigned to <code>\u23182 - 9</code>; both <code>\u23181</code> and <code>\u23189</code> are reserved by Drafts for the draft and action list show/hide, respectively.</p>\n<p>With the addition of themes, I&#8217;ve now modified the modules I have to include themes that I want to use in those different contexts. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll update this more over time. I primarily use dark mode, so that&#8217;s what I currently have in there. But you could also modify the scripts to include light themes as well. Here&#8217;s my <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1Jn\">Modules action group</a> as it stands today for you to play with and make your own. You&#8217;ll need to change the theme names in each of the module actions, else you might get an error.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t quite yet cracked the switching of syntaxes based on themes. I have, however, leveraged Matt Gemmell&#8217;s previous Switch Syntax action and <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1jz\">created my own</a> which provides a list of all the installed syntaxes. It&#8217;s not automated, but it does the job when I need it. I&#8217;m sure Rosemary is working on something even more clever\u2026</p>\n<h3>Automated Journaling</h3>\n<p>On the show, we talked about some of the automations I&#8217;ve used (in most cases, continued to use) frequently. One of my journal shortcuts saves the text of the journal as a PDF for future reading. That&#8217;s when David brought up a great suggestion: using a Shortcuts automation at a specific time to automatically save the journal at night so I don&#8217;t have to do it manually.</p>\n<p>It took a few modifications to my original shortcut, but I have the automatic saving of journal entries figured out. The <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4d686cd67ae440448d3e0469080db9d9\">Journal \u2022\u00a0Save</a> shortcut searches my Journal workspace for today&#8217;s journal entry, gets the content of the draft, creates an entry title (formatted <code>Journal Entry yyyy-MM-dd</code>), creates a nicely-formatted PDF, and saves the PDF version to <code>/iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/Journal/</code>.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-bug\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-bug\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> I manually move these once a week during my weekly review for now, until the Shortcuts team actually gives me that built in feature.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-tried\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-tried\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> This action can be used with Shortcuts automation; if you choose to run the automation without asking, it will run automatically in the background. I have mine set to run at 11:00 pm every day, and in my testing since we recorded, it&#8217;s been working fantastically.</p>\n<p>This then lead me to <strong><em>change</em></strong> the way I&#8217;ve been journaling, so that I can just automate the creation of the journal entry and never miss a day. The old way of starting my journal is answering a couple of questions: did I wear my watch to sleep to get data out of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">AutoSleep</a> \u2013\u00a0a feature that is broken due to an iOS 14.5 bug \u00a0\u2013 and how did I feel when I woke up. Here&#8217;s a secret: I&#8217;m not sure I sleep all that well generally, I never use the quantifiable data in any meaningful way, and I don&#8217;t know that I need a reminder of how shitty all that can be and make me feel. If I want a pretty chart or other meaningful insights, I&#8217;d be better off going into AutoSleep or the Health app to get it. Weighing the importance of sleep tracking vs daily journaling, having a journal entry for every day that is just automatically there just makes more sense. Using the <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0e033f7bbf0f465da352e8b0268c17a4\">Journal \u2022\u00a0Start</a> shortcut in conjunction with another Shortcuts automation which runs at 6:00am, and automatically starts a journal entry for me without any interaction on my part.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-forecast\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-forecast\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been running this for the week, and it&#8217;s been really great so far. Removing the friction of interacting every time I want to start and save a journal entry has made me want to journal more. Sometimes, it&#8217;s those little things that get you change your mind. I&#8217;m calling this a win.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thanks again David and Rosemary for having me on, and for the idea to be a better Automator!</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-2049-first\">\nYou can find my first appearance <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/automators/23\">here</a>.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-2049-first\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2049-bug\">\nI am having a shortcuts bug where the file from Shortcuts gets created with a <code>-2</code> suffix, which is hyper annoying.

I&#8217;ve been listening for years, but I never started my own. But by the time that <a href=\"https://nahumck.me/fundamentally-broken/\">Seth and I did</a>, there was an emerging idea started by Jason Snell: <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/12/recording-a-podcast-locally-on-ios-without-a-mac/\">recording</a> and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/\">editing</a> podcasts iOS-only. As someone who rarely ever touches a Mac for their day-to-day work, this idea has continued to gnaw at my brain. I tried my hand a couple of times at doing something differently with it, but it never panned out the way I wanted.</p>\n<p>In an effort to head down this road, I ended up switching microphones last year: I had the clutch <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N1YPXW2/?tag=nahumck-20\">Blue Yeti</a> microphone, but decided on the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/?tag=nahumck-20\">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a> instead. Not only was it better for the environment in which I record, but it also afforded me the possibility to record using both the USB and XLR connections, pushing me closer to the goal of iOS-only.</p>\n<p>A month or so ago, I was recording the show via the late-2012 Mac mini I have. I ended up having an issue while recording, and I lost my audio in several spots. Given that this is one of two jobs that I ever ask it to do, I was understandably upset and put off by recording in the same way going forward. The idea of going iOS-only came back to the forefront of my mind. I again turned to <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/\">Jason&#8217;s setup</a>, only to realize that this was going to cost me several hundred dollars to create. I don&#8217;t have that lying around, and I wanted to find something that would work for me.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1590\"></span></p>\n<p>I can already record iOS-only: I can use my iPhone with AirPods to make the call and use my iPad Pro to record the local audio. This is how I recorded my end when I guested on <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/automators/23\">Episode 23 of the Automators podcast</a>. I enjoyed doing this, but I also don&#8217;t have a great way of having the good audio from my mic broadcast to the other hosts. I like the idea of using the iOS devices I have to record: I&#8217;m always going to have them with me, so it just makes more sense to use them for the complete audio setup. I can use either device to record or make the call, I just need a way to get the sound of the mic to both of them. So that&#8217;s where my search started. I had most of what I needed, I just needed an XLR interface of some type. Rather than search &#8216;USB XLR interface&#8217; like I had done multiple times before, I ended up just searching for &#8216;XLR interface&#8217;.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I ended up finding something new and unique: the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LS9JI22/?tag=nahumck-20\">R\u00f8de i-XLR</a>. This device was made for reporters, plugging into an XLR microphone and allowing mobile recording of interviews; when I saw it, I thought it might work perfectly for podcasting as well. Rather than take my XLR connection through an <a href=\"https://www.sounddevices.com/product/usbpre-2/\">expensive USB interface</a> into an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DPOXS8I/?tag=nahumck-20\">XLR recorder</a> of some type or another adaptor to my iPhone, this allows me to use my XLR connection and plug it directly into the iPhone without all the extra cables and steps. There&#8217;s even an app \u2013\u00a0the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/r%C3%B8de-reporter/id1066635435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">R\u00f8de Recorder</a> \u2013 which was specifically made for this microphone. The idea was intriguing, so I decided to purchase it and test it out.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1598\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1598\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1598\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/the-ios-only-podcasting-kit/ios-only-podcasting-schematic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?fit=2388%2C1668&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2388,1668\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iOS-Only Podcasting Schematic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The schematic.

Don\u2019t judge my drawing skills.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how my setup is all connected, using my iPad Pro 2018 and my iPhone Xs.<sup id=\"fnref-1590-links\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-links\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> First, I start with the power: I recommend using this Anker <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0721DV7YX/?tag=nahumck-20\">wall-charger</a>, which provides a Power Delivery USB-C port along with a USB-A quick charge. I use it all the time for travel, and it&#8217;s perfect for what I need. I use a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LNA0XCU/?tag=nahumck-20\">USB-C to USB-C</a> to power the iPad. Next, I connect the USB microphone cable to the iPad Pro using the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K6YFW7X/?tag=nahumck-20\">Satechi hub</a>;<sup id=\"fnref-1590-hub\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-hub\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> this also allows me to use the HDMI for an external monitor and the USB-C port to power everything. Then, I connect the R\u00f8de iXLR to the end of the cable which comes with the microphone, and plug that into my iPhone directly. Finally, I connect the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LPTAYI/?tag=nahumck-20\">over-the-ear headphones</a> to the the R\u00f8de iXLR and do a test recording to dial in the sound level for the environment. When I have that part set and I&#8217;m happy with the audio, I&#8217;ll connect the monitors directly to the back of the microphone so I can use them for the audio call; I can monitor the sound visually using R\u00f8de Reporter or <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Ferrite</a>. I prefer using Ferrite due to the smaller file sizes and better recording controls for volume as well as the ability to bookmark the audio when topic change and/or I cough; it helps me in the edit later. However, I have noticed that using the configuration menu in R\u00f8de Reporter allows me to use a -20 dB pad for the mic, resulting in quieter background noise and an overall better sound.</p>\n<p>I did run into one small technical issue when getting this all set up: when the i-XLR is connected to the iPhone, the cellular radio creates an interference with the audio. To avoid this in the audio track, I have to turn on airplane mode,<sup id=\"fnref-1590-Seth\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-Seth\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> then turn on the WiFi and then record. It&#8217;s a simple issue, and one that I&#8217;m not too concerned about: I can still get calls or messages if something is urgent. I also don&#8217;t want to be disturbed when I&#8217;m recording so that I can give the other person (or people) my fullest attention possible, so it&#8217;s a non-issue for me.<sup id=\"fnref-1590-device\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-device\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1586\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1586\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1586\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/the-ios-only-podcasting-kit/processed-with-darkroom-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?fit=3989%2C2656&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3989,2656\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone XS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Processed With Darkroom&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1559245336&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.25&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Processed With Darkroom&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iOS-Only Studio Setup\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;The iOS-only setup in my home studio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?fit=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1586\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=450%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?resize=1200%2C799&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/iOS-Only-Podcast-Studio.jpeg?w=3300&amp;ssl=1 3300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1586\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The iOS-only setup in my home studio.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For home use, I have my microphone on a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DY1F2CS/?tag=nahumck-20\">Neewer boom arm</a>,<sup id=\"fnref-1590-package\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-package\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">5</a></sup> which allows me to keep it at the appropriate level when I&#8217;m standing.

            "content_text": "I got into podcasting late. I&#8217;ve been listening for years, but I never started my own. But by the time that Seth and I did, there was an emerging idea started by Jason Snell: recording and editing podcasts iOS-only. As someone who rarely ever touches a Mac for their day-to-day work, this idea has continued to gnaw at my brain. I tried my hand a couple of times at doing something differently with it, but it never panned out the way I wanted.\nIn an effort to head down this road, I ended up switching microphones last year: I had the clutch Blue Yeti microphone, but decided on the Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB instead. Not only was it better for the environment in which I record, but it also afforded me the possibility to record using both the USB and XLR connections, pushing me closer to the goal of iOS-only.\nA month or so ago, I was recording the show via the late-2012 Mac mini I have. I ended up having an issue while recording, and I lost my audio in several spots. Given that this is one of two jobs that I ever ask it to do, I was understandably upset and put off by recording in the same way going forward. The idea of going iOS-only came back to the forefront of my mind. I again turned to Jason&#8217;s setup, only to realize that this was going to cost me several hundred dollars to create. I don&#8217;t have that lying around, and I wanted to find something that would work for me.\n\nI can already record iOS-only: I can use my iPhone with AirPods to make the call and use my iPad Pro to record the local audio. This is how I recorded my end when I guested on Episode 23 of the Automators podcast. I enjoyed doing this, but I also don&#8217;t have a great way of having the good audio from my mic broadcast to the other hosts. I like the idea of using the iOS devices I have to record: I&#8217;m always going to have them with me, so it just makes more sense to use them for the complete audio setup. I can use either device to record or make the call, I just need a way to get the sound of the mic to both of them. So that&#8217;s where my search started. I had most of what I needed, I just needed an XLR interface of some type. Rather than search &#8216;USB XLR interface&#8217; like I had done multiple times before, I ended up just searching for &#8216;XLR interface&#8217;.\nThat&#8217;s when I ended up finding something new and unique: the R\u00f8de i-XLR. This device was made for reporters, plugging into an XLR microphone and allowing mobile recording of interviews; when I saw it, I thought it might work perfectly for podcasting as well. Rather than take my XLR connection through an expensive USB interface into an XLR recorder of some type or another adaptor to my iPhone, this allows me to use my XLR connection and plug it directly into the iPhone without all the extra cables and steps. There&#8217;s even an app \u2013\u00a0the R\u00f8de Recorder \u2013 which was specifically made for this microphone. The idea was intriguing, so I decided to purchase it and test it out.\nThe schematic. Don\u2019t judge my drawing skills.\nHere&#8217;s how my setup is all connected, using my iPad Pro 2018 and my iPhone Xs.1 First, I start with the power: I recommend using this Anker wall-charger, which provides a Power Delivery USB-C port along with a USB-A quick charge. I use it all the time for travel, and it&#8217;s perfect for what I need. I use a USB-C to USB-C to power the iPad. Next, I connect the USB microphone cable to the iPad Pro using the Satechi hub;2 this also allows me to use the HDMI for an external monitor and the USB-C port to power everything. Then, I connect the R\u00f8de iXLR to the end of the cable which comes with the microphone, and plug that into my iPhone directly. Finally, I connect the over-the-ear headphones to the the R\u00f8de iXLR and do a test recording to dial in the sound level for the environment. When I have that part set and I&#8217;m happy with the audio, I&#8217;ll connect the monitors directly to the back of the microphone so I can use them for the audio call; I can monitor the sound visually using R\u00f8de Reporter or Ferrite. I prefer using Ferrite due to the smaller file sizes and better recording controls for volume as well as the ability to bookmark the audio when topic change and/or I cough; it helps me in the edit later. However, I have noticed that using the configuration menu in R\u00f8de Reporter allows me to use a -20 dB pad for the mic, resulting in quieter background noise and an overall better sound.\nI did run into one small technical issue when getting this all set up: when the i-XLR is connected to the iPhone, the cellular radio creates an interference with the audio. To avoid this in the audio track, I have to turn on airplane mode,3 then turn on the WiFi and then record. It&#8217;s a simple issue, and one that I&#8217;m not too concerned about: I can still get calls or messages if something is urgent. I also don&#8217;t want to be disturbed when I&#8217;m recording so that I can give the other person (or people) my fullest attention possible, so it&#8217;s a non-issue for me.4\nThe iOS-only setup in my home studio.\nFor home use, I have my microphone on a Neewer boom arm,5 which allows me to keep it at the appropriate level when I&#8217;m standing. I also have the iPad Pro in a stand and use the Magic Keyboard to type because I had it at home; you could use any wireless keyboard for this, and in the future, I might just pull the trigger on a Brydge Keyboard for my 11&#8243; iPad Pro, but I&#8217;m waiting for more reviews to come in to make the call. I may also look to improve my home setup with a mute switch, but I&#8217;m going to hold off for now.6\nThis iOS-only setup is completely portable for recording anywhere.\nWith a few more additions, not only can I have an iOS-setup at home, I can also have a completely mobile setup as well. I can start recording more often, no matter where I am: whether it&#8217;s traveling for work, going to my parents house on a short weekend trip, or taking a long-overdue vacation, I can record from wherever I am. I bought some inexpensive in-ear monitors and some duplicate cables, which complete the mobile setup. It all fits into a hard-side case made for my specific microphone, and the entire case fits in the bottom of my travel backpack, meaning I can go anywhere and record.\nEverything fits into one case for easy carrying.\n\nFrom here on out, I&#8217;m going to be recording iOS-only using this setup: my iPhone will record my local audio, and my iPad Pro will handle the call. The only bit that I don&#8217;t have is the recording of the call itself, which isn&#8217;t a big deal to me as long as the people I&#8217;m recording with know what they are doing. This setup allows me to use my iOS devices which have shown to be more dependable than my Mac mini. I find my new setup option to be better for the actual running of the show: I can have my iPad Pro in split screen to handle show notes in Drafts, Safari to do any real-time look-up, and the call in slide over on Skype; if I&#8217;m using FaceTime, I can simply just jump back to the call if I want by tapping the green indicator in the upper left of the screen.\nThis setup works surprisingly well. The audio quality is completely fine for anyone who&#8217;s not a die-hard purist with bottomless pockets. I&#8217;ve been testing a lot with it and can&#8217;t notice a difference in what I&#8217;ve been producing in the past. I&#8217;m trying to do this for as little as possible.

I&#8217;ve made some good purchases on a few times, and wanted to share them.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1450\"></span></p>\n<h3>iPad Case with Pencil</h3>\n<p>For a long time, I used the Logitech Create. Then I switched to the Smart Keyboard, as it made more sense to me. I purchased a back cover that I thought was ok, and then a magnetic pen holder. But\u2026 I really missed how the Create was able to hold my pencil for the few times I use it. Based on my Amazon search history, I ended up finding a new <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LLk3y5\">iPad Case w/ integrated Pencil holder</a>. And it&#8217;s really what I wanted in the first place.</p>\n<p>The case provides a rubberized surround, which integrates the Pencil holder. There are two small cut-outs on the back side of the Pencil, so that I can remove it quickly. Once I&#8217;m done, the Pencil is secured, nearly encapsulated by the rubber.

I did encounter a bug where iOS is not letting me use the mic for FaceTime or Skype calling. This was possible before, and is a bug that has been introduced in iOS 12.

            "content_text": "It&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve done one of these, but I wanted to share some of the things that have been piquing my interest as of late. I&#8217;ve made some good purchases on a few times, and wanted to share them.\n\niPad Case with Pencil\nFor a long time, I used the Logitech Create. Then I switched to the Smart Keyboard, as it made more sense to me. I purchased a back cover that I thought was ok, and then a magnetic pen holder. But\u2026 I really missed how the Create was able to hold my pencil for the few times I use it. Based on my Amazon search history, I ended up finding a new iPad Case w/ integrated Pencil holder. And it&#8217;s really what I wanted in the first place.\nThe case provides a rubberized surround, which integrates the Pencil holder. There are two small cut-outs on the back side of the Pencil, so that I can remove it quickly. Once I&#8217;m done, the Pencil is secured, nearly encapsulated by the rubber. It also has a cutout for the Smart Keyboard attachment, and doesn&#8217;t interfere with anything. This is by far the best combination I&#8217;ve used for portability and mode switching.
