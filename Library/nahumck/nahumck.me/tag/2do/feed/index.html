										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer opened my eyes to trying new things with task management. I had a great, wonderful system, <a title="Bifurcation - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/bifurcation">and then split it in two</a>. Then I <a title="Basic - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/basic">tried Reminders instead</a>, and loved it even more when I got my Apple Watch. And life as I knew it was going along just fine. Until something just felt off.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it. I was accomplishing what I needed, and there wasn&#8217;t really a hole in my system. Life had just gone from chaotic to simplistic. And maybe that&#8217;s why things felt wrong. I can&#8217;t explain why, but it just didn&#8217;t feel right anymore. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a bit of a sickness, but I have come to realize I need to have some complexity in my life.</p>
<p>So I started thinking of what to do next. Did I need to try a new system? I&#8217;ve tried <a title="OmniFocus for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">OmniFocus</a>, <a title="Things for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/things/id284971781?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Things</a>, <a title="Due for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/due-reminders-countdown-timers/id390017969?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Due</a>, etc. and nothing really stuck, despite those apps being great in their own ways. I thought about what made the Reminders experiment so great: the simplicity. But yet, when I needed to look at everything going on, it was cumbersome at best. I tried to make something work, but it just felt wrong to me. So maybe it wasn&#8217;t a problem of the tools I have and what I&#8217;m using, but rather <em>how</em> I&#8217;m using them (or not).</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s led me to a strange, crazy place.<br />
<span id="more-945"></span></p>
<h2>The New System</h2>
<p>So, this system I&#8217;ve developed uses four — yes, you read that right, four — different applications: Drafts, Reminders, Fantastical, and 2Do. I know, I know: this is <em><strong>NUTS</strong></em>. Why on earth would anyone want to use FOUR apps when you can use ONE task management system? I&#8217;m clearly off my rocker here. But here&#8217;s the thing: it&#8217;s really using one task management system — Reminders — all while giving me the flexibility I want while keeping the simplicity. So let me break it down.</p>
<h3>Drafts</h3>
<p><a title="Drafts on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Drafts</a> is the place where a majority of my tasks start anyway. It may be something I&#8217;m quickly thinking of, it might be grocery items, it might be a one-off thing that my boss said I need to get done. But it still goes to Drafts first.</p>
<p>The beauty here is that it&#8217;s one main point for entry, with the exception of capturing anything with Siri. Now that I have my Apple Watch, I find myself using Siri to do just that, and I&#8217;ve realized I need to have some sort of Reminders integration into my system. And because Drafts can also hook into Reminders, it&#8217;s an integral part of the system, even beyond <a title="Articles about Drafts - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/tag/drafts/">everything else</a> that I use it for already.</p>
<h3>Fantastical</h3>
<p>One area where Reminders.app falls short is input. I have, for a long time, loved the natural language parsing (NLP) capability of <a title="Fantastical for iPhone on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar/id718043190?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">Fantastical</a>. And I use that a lot for calendar entries for both work and home.</p>
<p>But one place I wasn&#8217;t using it before was for reminders. When I was using a dedicated app for task management before, I was using Dropbox to sync it all. I had a vastly different need then. I was using it for work and home, and Dropbox was the only way to have everything that I needed fully backed up if something bad were to happen to my device. But since I have made that split, my home task list became much easier to manage, and I don&#8217;t really need it.</p>
<p>Using NLP, I can send text from Drafts in a specific format to create a reminder at a specific time, set a repeat, set a list using the <code>/</code> followed by the list name, or even a priority by adding up to three <code>!</code> marks after it. The best part of this is that I can quickly take a list that I&#8217;ve entered into Drafts, add some key information about due dates/times, priority, or whatever &#8211; and send it along to get into my system. The parsing is flexible enough to handle the simple stuff all the way up to the more complex task entry.</p>
<h3>Reminders</h3>
<p>Reminders.app by itself is an OK app. There are a lot of improvements that could be made to make it better for most people &#8211; just like Apple did with Notes. But it does a <em>lot</em> of things really well. Notifications are really great with it because they stay persistent on the lock screen, even if I am turning on/off my screen; think of it like nagging alerts, but without the repeating sounds or occasional bugs of it not working. Reminders can really be what I need: simply a collection of lists, each with tasks that may or may not have a due date.</p>
<p>But the biggest power of using Reminders lies in the backbone that is the CalDav sync. And because Apple has made this something that developers can tap into, it allows you to use the simplicity of Reminders, while adding some layers of complexity if another app provides it. It allows me to enter in tasks from various sources, and have it show up in one place. And this is primarily how I was enjoying life since summer.</p>
<p>I still use the watch app to quickly check off a task, as the native watch app is really great. This may change in the future if a certain app gets a certain update that I want to see, but for now this is good enough for my wrist.</p>
<p>But the Reminders.app on the phone viewing wasn&#8217;t doing it for me. I needed to see everything in my system at once, and you simply can&#8217;t do that in Reminders. But, I know a few places that can. And that&#8217;s where an old friend comes in…</p>
<h3>2Do</h3>
<p>I have <a title="Move Your Thoughts to 2Do - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do">long loved</a> <a title="2Do for iOS on the App Store" href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do-reminders-personal-planner/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">2Do</a>, as you all well <a title="Articles on 2Do - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/tag/2do/">know</a>. And somewhere beginning in the fall, I decided to start trying other things. I wanted to try them to gain perspective, and because I truly want the app to be better; trying out other apps allows me to gain insight on how it improve something and make it even more vital to my system. And as Fahad can attest to by my numerous messages and lengthy notes on what I would love to see going forward in the app, my passion for it has not dwindled at all. In fact, some of the experimentation of other apps has actually made me appreciate it more. Recently with my uneasy feeling, I&#8217;ve been pulled back to 2Do more and more.</p>
<p>And so I was torn: I like a lot that Reminders has to offer, but I like a little more complexity like 2Do can provide. I like Reminders, I like Fantastical, I love 2Do. I like Drafts + Reminders, I love Drafts + Fantastical, I love Drafts + 2Do.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Drafts + Reminders.</li>
<li>Drafts + Fantastical.</li>
<li>Drafts + 2Do.</li>
<li>Drafts + Fantastical + Reminders + 2Do.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was the answer I was looking for, and I had it in my grasp at any point in time. 2Do has Reminders Sync capability. I previously was using Dropbox to get all of the benefits of 2Do, but now that my needs are simplified, it&#8217;s possible for me to use 2Do with Reminders Sync to bring the system together, without having to worry about <a title="Which Sync Method Should I Use? - 2doapp.com" href="http://www.2doapp.com/kb/article/which-sync-method-should-i-use.html">the caveats</a>. I get the benefits of Siri, Drafts, Fantastical, and 2Do, all in one system.</p>

<p>I think a big part of why this make so much sense to me is the GTD mentality of &#8220;review&#8221;. Using 2Do as the window into my tasks, and having the ability to tap an icon to view all of my lists at once, it&#8217;s basically the Review feature I was missing from my system. I tried to simulate this by keeping a big list in Drafts, but there are times that I need to have everything in one place, and using two different apps wasn&#8217;t working. I struggled to get my arms around it all, noticing that things would slip through here and there. I can also create <a title="Embracing Smart Lists - nahumck.me" href="https://nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do/#embracing-smart-lists">smart lists</a>, which can really bring it all together.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="943" data-permalink="https://nahumck.me/the-sum-of-the-parts/image-12-20-16-4-31-pm-1-jpeg/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?fit=1136%2C1006&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1136,1006" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="New System &#8211; Sorting A List" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C266&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?fit=1024%2C907&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-943 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=1100%2C974&#038;ssl=1" width="1100" height="974" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?w=1136&amp;ssl=1 1136w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C266&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C680&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Image-12-20-16-4-31-PM-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C907&amp;ssl=1 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I can also sort the tasks in my lists in 2Do, which is something greatly lacking in Reminders. I can look at the Scheduled view in Reminders.app, sorted by due date, but it&#8217;s not what I need from my other lists. There are times I want to see everything by priority or by a location or by due date. There are other times I want to take my entire list and focus on what&#8217;s really important. And using 2Do features on top of Reminders allows me that window into my life.</p>
<h2>A New Way Forward</h2>
<p>So, I now have Drafts as my entry point. Fantastical, Siri, and 2Do can handle the processing of tasks that I throw their way. Reminders will give me the notifications I need, except the badge count. And 2Do will give me the viewpoint into what the overall landscape of my personal task life will be, including the badge count, so I know if I haven&#8217;t gotten something done. And even though it sounds crazy to say that using four apps is better than using two, it&#8217;s 100% true for me. I&#8217;m entering tasks in a few different ways, being notified by persistent reminders, but my viewport into all of it is in one spot. And it&#8217;s a place I feel extremely comfortable in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using this system for only a short time. I&#8217;m sure that things will change. But I haven&#8217;t been this excited about my tasks in a while. Reminders is great, but it needed a little bit of help, and it came from an amazing, familiar place that I love. And even though I&#8217;m only a short time in — I can already tell that this is going to be something that I am extremely happy with for a while.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The sum of the parts really makes this system feel whole. It&#8217;s making me feel better about the things I&#8217;m doing. It&#8217;s helping me see what might have slipped my mind, or what glaring items I have that need to get done. It&#8217;s taken some time to get to this point, and I cannot believe that I wasn&#8217;t using this sooner. I guess all good things come to those who wait, right? I&#8217;m glad I took the time to wait for this to happen. And now starts the count of how long it will be until I change my mind again…</p>
<ol id="footnotes">
<li id="fn1">Until 2Do 4.0 happens. But, maybe even then, it won&#8217;t change my system much. Who knows. <a href="#ffn1"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the latest update in the App Store, <a href="http://www.2doapp.com/unchartered-waters/">2Do has gone free</a> for 14 days, with an in-app purchase to keep pro features. But the big news here: if you&#8217;ve ever wanted to try the app out in its full capability can now do so to see if <a href="https://nahumck.me/move-your-thoughts-to-2do/">switching to 2Do</a> is right for them.</p>
<p>Although I am happy to support developers — as I&#8217;ve probably purchased hundreds of dollars of apps — I&#8217;m really happy to see this type of change for productivity apps. So many of these types of apps need to have sustainable business models to keep them around, and are worthy of a higher price. But many users are hesitant to buy before they try. I like that these apps are starting to explore the try-before-you-buy model, and I hope that it brings more revenue to the developers that deserve it.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve written <a href="https://nahumck.me/tag/2do/">many times before</a>, 2Do is the best task management system I have ever used on iOS, hands down. And I&#8217;m really excited about the potential of a big 4.0 release in the future, full of a long wishlist of new features.<sup id="fnref-915-features"><a href="#fn-915-features" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what it was like to move to a new system, to try the best, now is your chance. What&#8217;s holding you back? Nothing now &#8211; go get <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter">2Do on the App Store</a> for free (to try). And if you like it, get the IAP, and support its continued development.</p>

Not that I would ever send that to Fahad. Nope. Not me. I wouldn&#8217;t send him a super-long list of things I&#8217;d love to see in the app, causing him to work night and day. Because that would be cruel. (Sorry Fahad. So sorry)&#160;<a href="#fnref-915-features">&#8617;</a>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer has been a busy one. It seems like the time of year that things will always get busy for me. I&#39;m currently working on a global launch of a product in four countries, and with all the little differences and nuances in each place, it has been difficult to keep track of all my tasks.</p>
<p>Which is why I love <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme" title="2Do for iOS">2Do</a> so much.</p>
<p>But this summer has been really different for me. Instead of one thing to focus on, I have a bunch more. More than I&#39;ve ever had to keep straight. And it&#39;s made even further complicated by personal life stuff. So there&#39;s been a need to re-evaluate what I&#39;m doing, and how I&#39;m doing it. Luckily, I have some amazing friends, and one in particular that has had similar issues and feelings this summer.<br />
<span id="more-865"></span><br />
<a href="#">Seth</a> and I have had many conversations about this, and he&#39;s had a lot of sage-like insight on the topic. In fact, he&#39;s written a <a href="http://sethclifford.me/2016/08/summer-explorations-part-one-a-feeling-of-relative-control/" title="Summer explorations, part one: A feeling of relative control.">three-part</a> <a href="http://sethclifford.me/2016/09/summer-explorations-part-two-the-serpentine-path-of-satisfaction/" title="Summer explorations, part two: The serpentine path of satisfaction.">summer</a> <a href="http://sethclifford.me/2016/09/summer-explorations-part-three-resolution-and-refinement/" title="Summer explorations, part three: Resolution and refinement.">series</a> on it, and I highly recommend that you take the time to read it (if you&#39;re in to the nerdy stuff we&#39;re in to). It&#39;s some magnificent writing, and I couldn&#39;t have said it better if I had tried.</p>
<p>I can manage a lot with 2Do. In fact, I can typically manage everything with it. It&#39;s the central hub, the central nervous system to my task management. But this summer has shown me one thing: I often need to split stuff in my brain and do things differently. Sure, I can filter what I&#39;m looking at, but it was starting to not feel like enough. Earlier this year, I tried some new things as <a href="https://nahumck.me/trials-and-experiments/" title="nahumck.me - Trials and Experiments">experiments</a> to see what else was out there, and how it could better serve me. Ultimately, I came back to where I started, and things were working OK. Kinda.</p>
<p>What I was noticing for work is that I wouldn&#39;t always see everything that I needed to do. I was managing my work tasks on my personal phone so that I could keep track of them, and keep them close at hand. But then I would forget to add an email to follow up on, or not remember to enter something from the chat system we use at work. If I&#39;m missing tasks that others are depending on me to get done, then I need to fix something.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t use a Mac at work, but rather the eight pound monstrosity that is my laptop. So I needed something that talked between iOS and my PC, but only for work. For many reasons, I&#39;m not going to keep my personal life on my work computer, but I didn&#39;t mind the reverse.</p>
<p>So I once again tried <a href="#">Todoist</a>. But rather than moving over everything and having the app on my first home screen, I put only work tasks in it and moved it into a folder on my second screen; this allows me to be able to access it, but it&#39;s not in my face. As Seth said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Now I’ve realized with all the things I’m tracking, the best way to do that and accommodate my personal wishes to keep work and personal life connected but separate means I take that information and split it right down the middle.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I really didn&#39;t like this to start. Not at all. It broke my brain. <em>Give it more time: it will be OK,</em> I was told. So I did. And as I continued, I had the same feeling as he did:</p>
<blockquote><p>
For the next 36 hours or so, I had all of my life in those two apps. And then I just freaked out. No, seriously, I did. I had a baby anxiety attack, quickly righted the ship, realized I’m a total asshole, thanked the heavens that this was my biggest problem right now, and just said fuck it, it’s going to be [my app] again, and that’s that.
</p></blockquote>
<p>After about a week, I began to see how much I actually really love this. I&#39;ve been able to install the <a href="http://www.todoist.com/outlook" title="The best free Outlook to do task and task list app: Todoist">Outlook add-on for Todoist</a>, so that it&#39;s completely integral to my workflow. And that&#39;s been a game changer. In fact, it&#39;s been a huge boost in productivity for me. I was originally going to wait until I had my new job,<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> but the suggestion that I set this up now instead of when I&#39;m in my new role was a great idea.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s my current setup: I&#39;m still using 2Do for my personal tasks. But I&#39;m also using Todoist for work. And this bifurcation is working. I&#39;m still as just productive as using one app, if not even more so with two. I can use the right app, at the right time, in the right place.</p>
<p>The big thing with all of this: you shouldn&#39;t worry about what app(s) others are using, but rather you should focus on what makes sense to you and how it makes you feel. If your work and personal life need a specific solution, whether that is one or more apps, it just needs to help you stay focused, feel OK, and allow you to take care of your needs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m really glad I&#39;m not alone in this. Not by a long shot. I have made several friends specifically because of this <strike>condition</strike> line of thinking. We&#39;re not in the same physical space, but at least we have <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme" title="Slack for iOS">a way</a> to talk about it. As Seth put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you’ve made it this far, I truly am sorry. And thankful. We should hang out.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We should. And we will. But for now: we&#39;ll continue to talk frequently about things like this, commiserating, changing, learning, and sharing our experiences. And that&#39;s good enough&#8230; for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many times with many things where I can be afraid to try something new. Trying something not in my comfort zone can be downright frightening. Other times, I&#8217;m plagued by the friction that comes from doing the new thing. But for all of the reasons not to do it, I still want to try them: I&#8217;m curious about new things, new possibilities, and wonder if there are better tools out there for me to use. And I&#8217;m easily distracted by new, shiny things.</p>
<p>Recently, tried using new task management apps.<sup id="fnref-800-1"><a href="#fn-800-1">1</a></sup> There have been updates to several apps, most notably <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-task-manager/id572688855?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me">Todoist</a> and <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me">OmniFocus</a>. I wanted to see what benefits they could offer me over my current app, <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me">2Do</a>. There was a huge group of people that really started loving 2Do on iOS. Many users switched over. But for many [private] reasons, there had been a slowdown in development. And I&#8217;d be lying if I said it didn&#8217;t worry me a bit; after all, it&#8217;s <em>one</em> person doing the entire app.</p>
<p>So in this slowdown, I wanted to experiment to see what else was out there. The first point of friction was moving select things over; most apps don&#8217;t have easy ways of export/import.  The second was the nomenclature: can often get lost with naming conventions until I have an equivalency to something that I know, something that is familiar. With those things out of the way, I could try doing things in a new way.<br />
<span id="more-800"></span></p>
<p>There were things about Todoist that I really liked: clean UI, collaborative tools, and the ability to enter in tasks for work via the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/todoist-to-do-list-and-ta/jldhpllghnbhlbpcmnajkpdmadaolakh?hl=en">Chrome extension</a>. And while this felt OK and I spent a few days with it, it didn&#8217;t <em>feel</em> right. I don&#8217;t collaborate with many people on tasks, and when I do, it&#8217;s usually work and I need to go see them anyway.</p>
<p>So I once again tried OmniFocus to see if the new changes – especially to the input method via <a href="http://taskpaper.com">TaskPaper</a> format – would work for me. The taskpaper format is really interesting, when it works well; it was cumbersome to get right, however, which is probably due to my lack of knowledge of TaskPaper more than the feature itself. I also dove into the <a href="https://support.omnigroup.com/omnifocus-mail-drop/">MailDrop</a> feature, and it&#8217;s fantastic: the ability to set email addresses, even as a temporary one, is great. And I definitely missed the Forecast and Review features, both of which are top notch. But one of the big things that I had difficulty with was the lack of batch editing. It made it very difficult to move a huge Inbox full of tasks to one context or another, and is something I cannot fathom as to why it&#8217;s not implemented yet.<sup id="fnref-800-2"><a href="#fn-800-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>So after spending some time entering in all my tasks to other apps, I was met with a notification when I got home: <a href="http://www.2doapp.com/little-things/">2Do beta v3.8.3</a>. Couldn&#8217;t really have been timed better, huh? After a long period with no updates, I was happy to see the improvements, offer some suggestions, and talk to him about the ones to come. Most importantly, I needed to <a href="https://nahumck.me/making-2do-lists-better">implement them into my daily workflow</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, I was upset with myself for wasting time: why had I spent the effort to move things over to different systems, only to find that my current app was what I needed? I have things to do, and messing around with my task management system shouldn&#8217;t be one of them. I felt like I should have said &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;, like trying to convince an ex-girlfriend to get back together after taking a break to see what else is out there.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>It was actually the <em>best</em> thing I could have done. What this has shown me is invaluable: ways to use my current system that are even better for what I need. There were positive things of these other apps that I tried, and fortunately, I can bring a few of them over using the current feature set.</p>
<p>A prime example was something that I completely missed when <a href="http://www.2doapp.com/youve-got-task/">Email 2Do</a> was first launched: if someone sends me an email to a specific email address, they can <em>send me a task</em>. Even better, if my wife sends me an email with the subject &#8220;Groceries&#8221; and puts a numbered list in the body of it, now I can get the shopping checklist right there in 2Do without any input from me.<sup id="fnref-800-3"><a href="#fn-800-3">3</a></sup> I&#8217;m hopeful that with future updates, that there will be the ability to add more functionality to Email 2Do, so that there can be more detail added like due times, tags, locations, etc. I can see this being useful for when I get a grocery list and have to get something after I leave work.</p>
<p>Another thing I learned in this experiment was that I was over-tagging and over-searching. I had too many tags that I was using to identify tasks. If I have a task in the &#8220;Home&#8221; list, why do I need to tag it with &#8220;Home&#8221;? This is completely redundant. And I really only need a handful of Smart Lists, not the 10 that I previously had. I completely rebuilt my work tasks from the list I created when I moved things to Todoist and OmniFocus, and had a better understanding of what needed to be accomplished for each of my four programs. And I also am now sparingly using starred or priority tasks, reserving them for only the highest of importance. All of this has helped me clean up my task list and get more focused.</p>
<p>The biggest thing I&#8217;ve learned from this: fundamentally, at my core, I&#8217;m a broken person. I do a lot of this to myself. But I accept it’s in my nature to always wonder if the grass is greener, and spend my time playing with new things when my existing thing works perfectly well. Having gone through this, I can see where I can make changes, and build my tools in such a way to make them work better with my current thing than I did before. And even though it may take some time and effort to do these things only to find them futile, I learn a lot new methods, better ways to use my current system, and clear out the stuff that isn&#8217;t really important.</p>
<p>Conducting a trial of apps was a great exercise, and I&#8217;m glad I did it. It was painful, but rewarding. I learned a lot, rebuilt my paradigms, and I learned how to do things better with what I have. And that&#8217;s a great feeling.</p>
