Don&#8217;t get me wrong: it&#8217;s not because there isn&#8217;t anything, but rather that it&#8217;s become second nature to the way I&#8217;m working with my systems. This is probably why I don&#8217;t do massive reviews of iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, or macOS every year: having to keep all this straight in my brain \u2013\u00a0given everything else I have going on in my life \u2013\u00a0just isn&#8217;t going to happen. But every fall, I do enjoy writing about the latest version of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&#038;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts</a> and how it&#8217;s improving my daily life.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to notice something here: this isn&#8217;t going to be a big, extensive review: there&#8217;s no actions, no crazy automations. This isn&#8217;t for a lack of updates, but it&#8217;s rather a reflection of where my life is at the moment. I actually think that if I&#8217;m going to continue to share content \u2013 especially with Drafts, Shortcuts, productivity, journaling, etc. \u2013\u00a0I need to approach everything I do from this point on from a smaller perspective, rather than an all-encompassing viewpoint. I think that many of you would appreciate shorter, easier-to-digest posts that can give targeted use cases/actions/automations going forward. <em>This is the way</em>.</p>\n<p>Drafts, of course, provides the compatibility you&#8217;ve come to expect with the new iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS updates that occur every fall. This year is no different, but one important thing is that some of what Drafts now provides is further extension of already existing functionality. Some of the new features have existed on one part of the platform and not the other due to OS limitations, but now they are synchronized in iOS/iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey. It brings a sense of cohesiveness across your devices that previously wasn&#8217;t there, and I think will open the doors to a lot more possibilities for both iOS/iPadOS and macOS users alike.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the biggest parts of this year&#8217;s fall update is the all-new watchOS app, completely rewritten in Swift. This isn&#8217;t a small undertaking, but it takes the already fantastic watch app and adds additional functionality. It retains everything that it had before, but adds the ability for multiple compilation types. If you really want, you can now have an all-Drafts watch face. Another nice feature, and one I&#8217;ve wanted for a while, is the inbox count reflecting the default workspace options; this means I no longer need to see 60+ drafts in my inbox, but rather only a handful that I want to keep in an inbox.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2126\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2126\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2126\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/drafts-v28-watch-faces/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?fit=1665%2C890&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1665,890\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Drafts v28 Watch Faces\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Ok, an all-Drafts watch face might be a _bit_ too much, even for me, but it&#8217;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?fit=450%2C241&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?fit=1024%2C547&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?resize=1024%2C547&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"547\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2126\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?resize=1024%2C547&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?resize=450%2C241&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?resize=768%2C411&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?resize=1536%2C821&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?resize=1100%2C588&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?w=1665&amp;ssl=1 1665w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2126\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ok, an all-Drafts watch face might be a _bit_ too much, even for me, but it&#8217;s possible.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another huge update is the incorporation of Shortcuts for the Mac.

While this isn&#8217;t the Quick Note feature we&#8217;d all love,<sup id=\"fnref-2130-yes\"><a href=\"#fn-2130-yes\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> it is going to be helpful for when I&#8217;m writing/researching a topic I want to investigate and/or write about. Another fantastic usability improvement is the new tag selection interface, which lets you select from your current tags as you type so you don&#8217;t duplicate them in weird ways (think: post, posts). In the last few years, I&#8217;ve actually pared down my usage of tags because I didn&#8217;t want them to proliferate too much; now that this feature is there, I might tag my drafts with more than a singular tag. I like this interface so much that I&#8217;m hoping Drafts adds this same functionality for creating <code>[[wiki-style]]</code> links, as it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m using a lot more for my own personal uses. I know that this would be a massive undertaking like folding headers would be, but I can&#8217;t help but want both in the future.</p>\n<p>Speaking of wiki-style linking, there are a few new ways to interact with them. You can now right-click/long tap on them to give a quick look of the text as well  and commands for wiki links: open the draft in the current or new window, preview in a new window, or a series of copy commands for the content, title, link, or UUID. I really like the new expandable/collapsible menus in iOS/iPadOS 15, which Drafts takes advantage of here; it&#8217;s a great way for Drafts and other apps to add a lot of functionality at your fingertips.</p>\n<p>Folder bookmarks are a feature that have been included in apps like Scriptable for a long time. But they are now included in the File action and File Manager scripting. This will allow those that like to write in other apps \u2013\u00a0say Obsidian or iA Writer \u2013\u00a0to save to a specific location outside of the Drafts sandbox. You can also use the scripting to <em>read</em> as well as write to a location, making it possible to use Drafts with apps like Working Copy on iOS/iPadOS or Taskpaper on the Mac.<sup id=\"fnref-2130-Merlin\"><a href=\"#fn-2130-Merlin\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> I think this will open a door to those that love using Drafts on iOS/iPadOS and then might want other tools on the Mac. It&#8217;s not using the file manager to store the files, but it does give the option to use it through actions. I can see where someone might use this to run a single action on files with a specific tag, and have them saved to a specific location in Files; they might also run another action to import those files back into Drafts. It&#8217;s not something built in and requires manual syncing but it&#8217;s very possible to create now. I hope to see it taken that last step further to open up Drafts to more people who are searching for their <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/searching-for-the-perfect-ios-markdown-writing-tool/\">ideal solution</a>.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a new &#8220;What&#8217;s New&#8221; screen where you can find all of the high-level features as well as a link to the full change log to see the small improvements to things like interface updates, automations, bug fixes, share extensions, and more. You can find this in the Settings (gear) menu in the bottom right of the screen, just under where you can manage your subscription.<sup id=\"fnref-2130-recommend\"><a href=\"#fn-2130-recommend\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> You can interact with this new what&#8217;s new screen and even jump to the Drafts website to check out specific features or the full change log. And I almost forgot the best part of this update by far: the two new icon choices. I really adore the color palette of both of them and think they are fantastic additions.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing that strikes me with this release is the continued customization and usability enhancements update after update with Drafts. Going all the way back to the initial <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/\">Drafts 5 launch</a>, the customization was further refined from Drafts 4; workspaces created a customizable, modular interface to make that app yours. In <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-15-review-multiwindow-shortcuts-and-more/\">Drafts 15</a>, contextual menus and updated icons further extended the customization to pick just the right look for workspaces and actions; Multiwindow support brought more power to the user by navigating back and forth through their drafts. <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-22-review-widgets-scribble-and-more/\">Drafts 22</a> brought us widgets to customize our home screens and quickly jump into the app or use an action directly. In <a href=\"https://nahumck.me/drafts-26-the-customization-update/\">Drafts 26</a>, the ability to completely <a href=\"https://tools.getdrafts.com/themes/theme-builder\">customize the interface</a> and create your own <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/syntax_definitions\">syntaxes</a> was introduced, spawning completely unique apps from user to user. And now with Drafts 28, we get more integrations in actions to make Drafts yours and be more extensible. This is yet another solid release in a long string of updates since April 2018. I&#8217;m looking forward to what&#8217;s coming next.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-2130-yes\">\nYes, I&#8217;d like the option to use Drafts instead of notes, but I don&#8217;t think that will ever happen.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-2130-yes\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2130-Merlin\">\nLooking at you, Merlin.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-2130-Merlin\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2130-recommend\">\nWhich I highly recommend you pick up.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-2130-recommend\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

It&#8217;s not something built in and requires manual syncing but it&#8217;s very possible to create now. I hope to see it taken that last step further to open up Drafts to more people who are searching for their ideal solution.\nThere&#8217;s a new &#8220;What&#8217;s New&#8221; screen where you can find all of the high-level features as well as a link to the full change log to see the small improvements to things like interface updates, automations, bug fixes, share extensions, and more. You can find this in the Settings (gear) menu in the bottom right of the screen, just under where you can manage your subscription.3 You can interact with this new what&#8217;s new screen and even jump to the Drafts website to check out specific features or the full change log. And I almost forgot the best part of this update by far: the two new icon choices. I really adore the color palette of both of them and think they are fantastic additions.\nThe biggest thing that strikes me with this release is the continued customization and usability enhancements update after update with Drafts. Going all the way back to the initial Drafts 5 launch, the customization was further refined from Drafts 4; workspaces created a customizable, modular interface to make that app yours. In Drafts 15, contextual menus and updated icons further extended the customization to pick just the right look for workspaces and actions; Multiwindow support brought more power to the user by navigating back and forth through their drafts. Drafts 22 brought us widgets to customize our home screens and quickly jump into the app or use an action directly. In Drafts 26, the ability to completely customize the interface and create your own syntaxes was introduced, spawning completely unique apps from user to user. And now with Drafts 28, we get more integrations in actions to make Drafts yours and be more extensible. This is yet another solid release in a long string of updates since April 2018. I&#8217;m looking forward to what&#8217;s coming next.\n\n\n\n\nYes, I&#8217;d like the option to use Drafts instead of notes, but I don&#8217;t think that will ever happen.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nLooking at you, Merlin.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nWhich I highly recommend you pick up.&#160;&#8617;",

I needed something that wasn&#8217;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&#8217;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MTSF94C/?tag=nahumck-20\">11&#8243; Brydge Pro keyboard</a> review unit to try out.<br />\n<span id=\"more-1622\"></span></p>\n<p>The unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&#8217;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&#8217;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&#8217;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off. When you use it in tablet mode \u2013 the mode where you can write on it with the pencil \u2013 it does prevent it from folding fully flat; you&#8217;ll have to set it off to the side to use it in that way. There&#8217;s just no room for the back panel in that device sandwich. It just feels odd to throw that to the side when you want to use it in this way.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1628\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1628\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/brydge-pro-keyboard/47d65602-be6b-4dc9-9234-460e096678e8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?fit=4465%2C2512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4465,2512\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1547316865&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"brydge-pro-keyboard-11-tablet-mode\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;Brydge Pro in tablet mode&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?fit=450%2C253&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1628\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=450%2C253&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=450%2C253&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?w=3300&amp;ssl=1 3300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1628\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brydge Pro in tablet mode</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The keyboard itself is a Bluetooth keyboard, and utilizes a USB-C cable to charge. You can even charge the keyboard from your iPad Pro if you&#8217;re running out of power. Out of the box, the keyboard had about 78% power, which was great to get me started. It took about 5 days for the battery to run down to where I wanted to charge it again, likely due to the backlit keys. I have found that if you&#8217;re doing a lot of typing with the keyboard lit, you&#8217;re going to drain it a lot faster.</p>\n<p>Having the battery in the keyboard means it was going to be heavy compared to the SKF, which brings me to the first thing I immediately noticed about the Brydge Pro keyboard: this thing is <em>heavy</em>. Not just a little, but a lot. At 700 grams for the keyboard and the protective cover, it more than doubles the weight of the iPad Pro<sup id=\"fnref-1622-weight\"><a href=\"#fn-1622-weight\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> carry in my bag; compare that to the SKF, which clocks in at just 302 grams, and it&#8217;s clear to see that you need to be very comfortable with the extra weight if you&#8217;re going to carry this around. It may not seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s significant. The extra weight is great for when you&#8217;re using it in your lap, however, like when you&#8217;re on a couch or as I did in a car while on a road trip; the SKF tends to be more top-heavy,<sup id=\"fnref-1622-heavy\"><a href=\"#fn-1622-heavy\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> and doesn&#8217;t feel as stable in those instances whereas the Brydge felt solid.</p>\n<p>The next thing I noticed: the keyboard is a bit narrower than the SKF. Being that this is the 11&#8243; model, that width can take some getting used to. But I was able to adapt over the first several days. The placement of the Siri key is also a bit difficult with the layout, as my finger often presses is when I&#8217;m attempting to use the control key. Again, this layout just takes some getting use to and is not insurmountable; I&#8217;m even trying to utilize Siri more now with this key, using the Type to Siri accessibility feature, and the availability of such a key is welcome. Having the media keys above the row is great. I really wish that Apple would figure out how to make this happen. I&#8217;ve suggested a couple of different ways before, but I doubt they&#8217;d ever consider it.<sup id=\"fnref-1622-idea\"><a href=\"#fn-1622-idea\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>My review unit did have a couple of issues: I noticed that the lettering on the keys weren&#8217;t straight. I notice these sorts of things all the time as part of my day job, so it was immediately apparent to me. It&#8217;s not a deal breaker by any means, and my hope is that it is because this is an early review unit. The main issue that I did have with the keyboard has been the missed keystrokes. It&#8217;s not all the time, but when it does happen, it takes me out of my writing focus. I reached out to the team at Brydge to let them know, and not only did they quickly respond acknowledging my concern while assuring me that this is not normal and they wanted to inspect the unit to see what was going on, but they also shipped me a new one the day after. Issues can happen in products from time to time, and even though this appears to be an isolated incident, the quick customer service experience and the fact that Brydge stand by their products is fantastic. The second unit I used did not have this issue, and most of my missed keystrokes were due to the more narrow keyboard or my lack of force to activate the key travel.</p>\n<p>Overall, I really like the Brydge Pro keyboard. The keys feel very good, the infinite angles and better lap capability are very versatile, and it really does make this combination of Brydge keyboard and iPad Pro feel like a traditional laptop. But I also couldn&#8217;t help but notice that this might not be the best keyboard for me for the way I do work. In my day job, I&#8217;m often moving between typing and notetaking with the Apple Pencil, and the Brydge is more cumbersome for that particular way of working. I can lay it fully flat, but that doesn&#8217;t work as well sitting on my lap.</p>\n<p>At the end of my time with the review unit, I came away mixed: it&#8217;s not as flexible for my style of working, but it&#8217;s a really fantastic option for the iPad Pro. I&#8217;m likely keeping my iPad Pro for a few more years, so having this option in addition to the Smart Keyboard Folio and the Smart Folio (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H88J5GS/?tag=nahumck-20\">knockoff</a>) is the trifecta, and something I&#8217;m excited to add to my kit portfolio. I might, however, wait a bit before I buy this: with iPadOS 13 and the addition of an accessibility feature which provides cursor support, I can&#8217;t help but think that Brydge might be working on a trackpad edition, similar to the version they have for the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077GJ92LX/?tag=nahumck-20\">Surface Pro</a>. If this existed, I wouldn&#8217;t have to carry an extra piece of kit in my bag. If they added that feature, it would push me over the edge for sure. But if you&#8217;re in the market for a laptop-like keyboard, I cannot recommend this one enough.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-first\">\nI actually bought the Smart Folio (SF) before this, but immediately returned it after 30 min because I realized that my use cases needed the SKF.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1622-first\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-weight\">\nthe iPad Pro weighs 470g, for reference&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1622-weight\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-heavy\">\nThere&#8217;s that word again, heavy.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1622-heavy\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-idea\">\nMy idea: turn the &#8220;globe&#8221; key in the bottom left of the keyboard with a &#8220;FN&#8221; key. Add the media functions to the number keys in the same way. This would also allow for the addition of a hard-key Siri button if you press and held the combination for a home button.

            "content_text": "When I purchased iPad Pro 11&#8243;, I immediately bought the Smart Keyboard Folio (SKF, as I refer to it).1 At the time, this was the best \u2013\u00a0and only \u2013\u00a0keyboard option made specifically for the iPad Pro. I needed something that wasn&#8217;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&#8217;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an 11&#8243; Brydge Pro keyboard review unit to try out.\n\nThe unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&#8217;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&#8217;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&#8217;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off. When you use it in tablet mode \u2013 the mode where you can write on it with the pencil \u2013 it does prevent it from folding fully flat; you&#8217;ll have to set it off to the side to use it in that way. There&#8217;s just no room for the back panel in that device sandwich. It just feels odd to throw that to the side when you want to use it in this way.\nBrydge Pro in tablet mode\nThe keyboard itself is a Bluetooth keyboard, and utilizes a USB-C cable to charge. You can even charge the keyboard from your iPad Pro if you&#8217;re running out of power. Out of the box, the keyboard had about 78% power, which was great to get me started. It took about 5 days for the battery to run down to where I wanted to charge it again, likely due to the backlit keys. I have found that if you&#8217;re doing a lot of typing with the keyboard lit, you&#8217;re going to drain it a lot faster.\nHaving the battery in the keyboard means it was going to be heavy compared to the SKF, which brings me to the first thing I immediately noticed about the Brydge Pro keyboard: this thing is heavy. Not just a little, but a lot. At 700 grams for the keyboard and the protective cover, it more than doubles the weight of the iPad Pro2 carry in my bag; compare that to the SKF, which clocks in at just 302 grams, and it&#8217;s clear to see that you need to be very comfortable with the extra weight if you&#8217;re going to carry this around. It may not seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s significant. The extra weight is great for when you&#8217;re using it in your lap, however, like when you&#8217;re on a couch or as I did in a car while on a road trip; the SKF tends to be more top-heavy,3 and doesn&#8217;t feel as stable in those instances whereas the Brydge felt solid.\nThe next thing I noticed: the keyboard is a bit narrower than the SKF. Being that this is the 11&#8243; model, that width can take some getting used to. But I was able to adapt over the first several days. The placement of the Siri key is also a bit difficult with the layout, as my finger often presses is when I&#8217;m attempting to use the control key. Again, this layout just takes some getting use to and is not insurmountable; I&#8217;m even trying to utilize Siri more now with this key, using the Type to Siri accessibility feature, and the availability of such a key is welcome. Having the media keys above the row is great. I really wish that Apple would figure out how to make this happen. I&#8217;ve suggested a couple of different ways before, but I doubt they&#8217;d ever consider it.4\nMy review unit did have a couple of issues: I noticed that the lettering on the keys weren&#8217;t straight. I notice these sorts of things all the time as part of my day job, so it was immediately apparent to me. It&#8217;s not a deal breaker by any means, and my hope is that it is because this is an early review unit. The main issue that I did have with the keyboard has been the missed keystrokes. It&#8217;s not all the time, but when it does happen, it takes me out of my writing focus. I reached out to the team at Brydge to let them know, and not only did they quickly respond acknowledging my concern while assuring me that this is not normal and they wanted to inspect the unit to see what was going on, but they also shipped me a new one the day after. Issues can happen in products from time to time, and even though this appears to be an isolated incident, the quick customer service experience and the fact that Brydge stand by their products is fantastic. The second unit I used did not have this issue, and most of my missed keystrokes were due to the more narrow keyboard or my lack of force to activate the key travel.\nOverall, I really like the Brydge Pro keyboard. The keys feel very good, the infinite angles and better lap capability are very versatile, and it really does make this combination of Brydge keyboard and iPad Pro feel like a traditional laptop. But I also couldn&#8217;t help but notice that this might not be the best keyboard for me for the way I do work. In my day job, I&#8217;m often moving between typing and notetaking with the Apple Pencil, and the Brydge is more cumbersome for that particular way of working. I can lay it fully flat, but that doesn&#8217;t work as well sitting on my lap.\nAt the end of my time with the review unit, I came away mixed: it&#8217;s not as flexible for my style of working, but it&#8217;s a really fantastic option for the iPad Pro. I&#8217;m likely keeping my iPad Pro for a few more years, so having this option in addition to the Smart Keyboard Folio and the Smart Folio (knockoff) is the trifecta, and something I&#8217;m excited to add to my kit portfolio. I might, however, wait a bit before I buy this: with iPadOS 13 and the addition of an accessibility feature which provides cursor support, I can&#8217;t help but think that Brydge might be working on a trackpad edition, similar to the version they have for the Surface Pro. If this existed, I wouldn&#8217;t have to carry an extra piece of kit in my bag. If they added that feature, it would push me over the edge for sure. But if you&#8217;re in the market for a laptop-like keyboard, I cannot recommend this one enough.\n\n\n\n\nI actually bought the Smart Folio (SF) before this, but immediately returned it after 30 min because I realized that my use cases needed the SKF.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nthe iPad Pro weighs 470g, for reference&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nThere&#8217;s that word again, heavy.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nMy idea: turn the &#8220;globe&#8221; key in the bottom left of the keyboard with a &#8220;FN&#8221; key. Add the media functions to the number keys in the same way. This would also allow for the addition of a hard-key Siri button if you press and held the combination for a home button. Again, this is a way to solve it, and certainly not the way I envision Apple would do it. But I really wouldn&#8217;t mind it being there.&#160;&#8617;",

I created a quick action to apply a <code>#Today</code> and <code>#Evening</code> tag as a toggle, so that I can quickly tag tasks which show up in the view.

When I think of what I want Shortcuts to ultimately be, I can&#8217;t help but want certain features added: for Reminders, having the ability to check off a task would be beneficial for certain shortcuts. So while we wait Shortcuts.app to catch up, GoodTask has added a Siri Shortcut to complete a task (and do so in the background). You&#8217;ll need to go to Settings \u2192 Siri Shortcuts \u2192 Add Complete Task to get the Siri Shortcut and/or add it to Shortcuts.app.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m getting old, so I take vitamins. I use a reminder to trigger this, so I don&#8217;t forget. I took this one step further and created a shortcut to run on my iPhone which logs the vitamin intake \u2013\u00a0including all the breakdown of the various types of vitamins \u2013\u00a0into the Health app, as well as mark it in Streaks as complete to help me keep track of when I&#8217;ve taken it. I always thought it would be nice to complete the reminder as well, but I the lack of the feature has prevented it. But now, I can copy the exact title of the task (and it must be exact) for my vitamins, add a text block and some clipboard actions to save and retrieve,<sup id=\"fnref-1579-implementation\"><a href=\"#fn-1579-implementation\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> then add the GoodTask Complete Task action block; I also turned off the &#8220;Show When Run&#8221; option so that it runs seamlessly in the background.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1584\" data-permalink=\"https://nahumck.me/goodtask-4-5-checking-all-the-boxes/vitamins_gt_complete/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=1325%2C2616&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1325,2616\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Vitamins_GT_Complete\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=228%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=519%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=228%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1584\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=228%2C450&amp;ssl=1 228w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=768%2C1516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=519%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 519w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=1200%2C2369&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?w=1325&amp;ssl=1 1325w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>I use the native Reminders notifications due to the fact that they remain on the lock screen, but actions like the one outlined above have me rethinking that approach.

Again, this might not be as visually appealing as the Things view, but it provides me what I need while keeping the native Reminders service integration.\n\nCompleting Tasks\nFor a while now, I&#8217;ve been wanting to see more improvements to Reminders, but lately I&#8217;ve been wanting improved support within Shortcuts. When I think of what I want Shortcuts to ultimately be, I can&#8217;t help but want certain features added: for Reminders, having the ability to check off a task would be beneficial for certain shortcuts. So while we wait Shortcuts.app to catch up, GoodTask has added a Siri Shortcut to complete a task (and do so in the background). You&#8217;ll need to go to Settings \u2192 Siri Shortcuts \u2192 Add Complete Task to get the Siri Shortcut and/or add it to Shortcuts.app.\nI&#8217;m getting old, so I take vitamins. I use a reminder to trigger this, so I don&#8217;t forget. I took this one step further and created a shortcut to run on my iPhone which logs the vitamin intake \u2013\u00a0including all the breakdown of the various types of vitamins \u2013\u00a0into the Health app, as well as mark it in Streaks as complete to help me keep track of when I&#8217;ve taken it. I always thought it would be nice to complete the reminder as well, but I the lack of the feature has prevented it. But now, I can copy the exact title of the task (and it must be exact) for my vitamins, add a text block and some clipboard actions to save and retrieve,2 then add the GoodTask Complete Task action block; I also turned off the &#8220;Show When Run&#8221; option so that it runs seamlessly in the background.\n\nI use the native Reminders notifications due to the fact that they remain on the lock screen, but actions like the one outlined above have me rethinking that approach. GoodTask allows users to run a URL from the notification, which means I could run the shortcut straight from the notification and complete it all in one go. I&#8217;ll likely look to play around with this as time goes on.3\nThe full list of improvements can be found on the forums. Having been away for a while, I can see that there is a lot more to offer now with GoodTask than ever before. The developer is listening to suggestions, is adding features at a manageable pace, and I can really appreciate the level of continued development for the app.\n\n\n\n\nThis is my own affectionate name for these things.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nI wish they would fix this so that I can just use text and not have the extra blocks. Sigh.&#160;&#8617;\n\n\nPerhaps with iOS 13 around the corner Reminders will be improved, or third-party app notifications will be given the ability to perform in the same manner as Reminders. But I won&#8217;t hold my breath for either one.&#160;&#8617;",
