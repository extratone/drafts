I\u2019m trying to better myself as a human, and might write about that from time to time as well. It\u2019s all a process.<\/p>\n<p>I co-hosted the <a href=\"http:\/\/podcast.fundamentallybroken.men\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fundamentally Broken<\/a> podcast, a show about how Seth Clifford and I work through our ever-changing lives using evolving methodologies. It was cathartic. It was fulfilling. It was vulgar. It was our show. And now it&#8217;s in a <a href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/search.php?query=creator%3A%28Seth%20Clifford%20%26%20Tim%20Nahumck%29\">better place<\/a>\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been on other podcasts as a guest and written for other sites. You can view a full list <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/appearances\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I am a husband to the most <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/this-is-40\/\">wonderful wife<\/a>, and a proud father to 2 sons whom are 11 years apart. We had the <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/on-difficult-decisions\/\">most wonderful puppy<\/a> in the world, and sometime soon, will have another.
