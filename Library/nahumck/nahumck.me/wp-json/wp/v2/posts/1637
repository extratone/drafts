This will empower users to create new ways of working on their iPad, allowing users to integrate Drafts into more of their daily lives. I give a few examples here. For more on how Multiwindow works, I recommend reading <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review\/\">Federico&#8217;s review<\/a> and watching <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/x-vISTePKSk\">Chris Lawley&#8217;s video<\/a>, which provide the overview for all of iOS\/iPadOS 13.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Updated Interface<\/strong>: there are a multitude of improvements here, from iconography to re-written UI to contextual menus, new in iOS 13.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is a fantastic update, and has once again changed the way I use my devices with Drafts. In addition, it&#8217;s streamlined my workflows and opened up new possibilities for me. I hope that everyone finds more and more use cases for Drafts going forward.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drafts 15 has been released to support both iOS and the new iPadOS 13.
