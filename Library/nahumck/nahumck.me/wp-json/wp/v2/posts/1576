Last time there was a major release, I wrote the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/drafts-5-the-macstories-review\/\">Macstories Review<\/a>. But when it comes to a Mac and how best to integrate Drafts into the macOS ecosystem, I&apos;m simply not the right person to do the review justice. But thankfully, one of my favorite internet people reached out to me privately about writing the review for it, and I was thrilled to even be asked. To be clear: they didn&apos;t owe me that, but it is honestly a nice feeling to feel respected within this community. They also reached out to Federico about writing for MacStories, and he agreed.<\/p>\n<p>So, it&apos;s my pleasure to point you not here for a review, but over to MacStories where <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RosemaryOrchard\/\">Rosemary Orchard<\/a> has written a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/drafts-5-mac\/\">review of Drafts for Mac<\/a>. It&apos;s most of what I wanted to see when I wrote up my <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/drafts-5-0-a-wish-list\/\">Drafts 5.0 wishlist<\/a> months ago: a way to edit the notes on the Mac so that users didn&apos;t have to roll a different solution or pass notes back and forth in odd ways. What the new macOS app provides is exactly that, along with workspaces, themes, tagging, etc.<\/p>\n<p>What don&apos;t you get: the actions that Drafts is famous for on iOS.<\/p>\n<p>Remember: this is a v1.0 application, not the v5.7 application that we have on iOS. It&apos;s going to take time to get there. The platforms are different: this isn&apos;t a &quot;Marzipan&quot; app, this is a full-fledged macOS app written from the ground up. Things will take time to get there. The macOS app does have the advantage of already having a rich ecosystem of automation apps to pull from, like Automator and Keyboard Maestro, so there are already was to implement some automation.<\/p>\n<p>I&apos;m really happy with the macOS version. For me, it is exactly what I need: a way to view and edit my drafts on the Mac for the single purpose podcasting. Perhaps my needs will change in the future, just like Drafts&apos; place in the Apple ecosystem now that Drafts for Mac is finally here.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For many years, Drafts has been the place on iOS where text starts.
