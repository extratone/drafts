This is hands down the best keyboard for the iPad Pro, as many other people will tell you.<\/p>\n<p>What I love about this keyboard is that while it adds some heft to the device, it is still ultra-portable, and contains my entire work station in an all-in-one setup. In most cases, this is the only thing that I need to bring around with me. I can do some of my work, write to my heart&#8217;s content, and get anything and everything done with efficiency. The keys are backlit, which is a nice touch over the keyboard that I previously had. It&#8217;s the perfect compliment to the Apple Pencil, with the built in pen<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">cil<\/span> loop. And the best part of all: it&#8217;s attached to my iPad Pro. <em><strong><a title=\"Perfectly Mobile - nahumck.me\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/perfectly-mobile\/\">FINALLY<\/a><\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<h3>iMangoo Foldable Stand<\/h3>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1067\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/piques-of-the-week-volume-10\/image-3-31-17-2-11-pm-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-3-31-17-2-11-PM.png?fit=307%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"307,400\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iMangoo Foldable Stand\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-3-31-17-2-11-PM.png?fit=230%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-3-31-17-2-11-PM.png?fit=307%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1067 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-3-31-17-2-11-PM.png?w=200&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-3-31-17-2-11-PM.png?w=307&amp;ssl=1 307w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-3-31-17-2-11-PM.png?resize=230%2C300&amp;ssl=1 230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now that I have my iPad Pro with the Create keyboard, my old <a title=\"Logitech k480 Bluetooth Keyboard\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00MUTWLW4\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Logitech k480<\/a> has been given to my son for his use with his iPhone at school.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> Because I want his iPhone to last and it is permanently in a <a title=\"LifeProof Cases\" href=\"www.lifeproof.com\">LifeProof<\/a> Case, his phone doesn&#8217;t fit so well into the integrated stand on the keyboard. So I started looking at options for him to use for a stand.<\/p>\n<p>I originally was going to go after the <a title=\"Spinido Phone Stand Dock Holder\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00W6XFE3M\/?tag=nahumck-20\">current stand<\/a> I have, but it isn&#8217;t portable enough for what he would like. That&#8217;s when I ended up finding the <a title=\"iMangoo Foldable Stand - Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01959FPCY\/?tag=nahumck-20\">iMangoo Foldable Stand<\/a>. It is a very portable stand; in fact, it&#8217;s a little thicker than a credit card when fully collapsed. But it&#8217;s capable of holding your phone or tablet just fine. It&#8217;s not going to be the stand that looks pretty and is a perfect compliment to the Feng shui of your desk. It will, however, serve as a nice piece of kit in a carry bag that is a no-brainer. In fact, I ordered one for myself, and it&#8217;s been working out very nicely. The perfect complement to the mobile workstation.<\/p>\n<h3>SOMAN Solar Charger<\/h3>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1069\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/piques-of-the-week-volume-10\/image-4-8-17-3-45-pm-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-4-8-17-3-45-PM.png?fit=334%2C224&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"334,224\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"SOMAN Solar Charger\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-4-8-17-3-45-PM.png?fit=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-4-8-17-3-45-PM.png?fit=334%2C224&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1069 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-4-8-17-3-45-PM.png?w=200&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-4-8-17-3-45-PM.png?w=334&amp;ssl=1 334w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Image-4-8-17-3-45-PM.png?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This charger came my way at Christmas time as a gift.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> During that time, I was also reorganizing some things inside my house, and put it somewhere out of the way.
