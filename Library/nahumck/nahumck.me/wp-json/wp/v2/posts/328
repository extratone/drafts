One of the items listed in Gabe&#8217;s post is about not letting your actions pile up. <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n&#8220;Part of the problem I created for myself was an overwhelming number of conduits. My solution was to cut way back to only the actions I use regularly or that do things that the iOS 9 share sheet doesn&#8217;t do.&#8221;\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I must admit, I had that problem for a while too. And while I haven&#8217;t gone the same route to reduce the number of actions, I have found something that worked for me \u2014 using a method to shrink the Action Lists, while still having a large number of actions available.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Action Sets<\/h3>\n<p>Enter Action Sets.<a href=\"#fn-1\" id=\"fnref-1\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[1]<\/a> I define an action set as a single Drafts action that presents a menu of actions to choose from, then runs that selected action with your current Draft.<\/p>\n<p>The developer, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.agiletortoise.com\">AgileTortoise<\/a>, originally posted an action called &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/112\">Select Action<\/a>&#8221; where he demonstrates the concept with 2 built-in actions how this can be used. It is a simple 2-step action:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prompt:<br \/>\nThe spot where you list the actions you want to be grouped into a set.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>URL:<br \/>\n<code>drafts4:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?uuid=[[uuid]]&amp;action=[[prompt_button]]<\/code><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><figure>\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Select-Action-Set.png?w=768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Select Action Set\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><br \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>At the time, I didn&#8217;t think much of it. But when I started realizing the power this had to clear up my action lists, I immediately started grouping my actions together in this way. The first time this started was with <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/fantastical-2-calendar-reminders\/id718043190?at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">Fantastical<\/a>. I had 6 actions that I used with the app:<a href=\"#fn-2\" id=\"fnref-2\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1Om\">Event<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1Or\">Events<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1Os\">Quick Events<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1Pb\">Reminder<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1Xv\">Reminders<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1Xw\">Quick Reminders<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Event and Reminder are single items, and require the user to hit &#8220;Add&#8221; in the top right. Events and Reminders also require the user input, but the actions call each line of the Draft instead of a single line. Quick Events and Quick Reminders do not require user intervention, and call each line until there are none left; this is especially handy for when you need to input many dates, such as importing your company holiday schedule. These are all great actions, but it took up 6 lines of my Drafts space.<\/p>\n<p>I made one Action Set called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1eb\">Fantastical&#8230;<\/a>&#8221;. One line, but with 6 different inputs. Later, I modified it to only have the 3 events-based actions, because I do not use Reminders integration now for <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/2do\/id303656546?at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">2Do<\/a>, my task management app of choice. <\/p>\n<figure>\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Fantastical-Action-Set.png?w=768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fantastical Action Set\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><br \/>\n<\/figure>\n<h3>Action Set Keys<\/h3>\n<p>When you have finally created the Action Sets you want, and if you run them frequently, consider making an <a href=\"https:\/\/agiletortoise.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/202865034-Using-the-Enhanced-Keyboard\">Action Keys<\/a> for your Enhanced Keyboard row. If you assign an Action Set to a Key, you will be able to bring up the Action Set menu quickly for manipulation.<\/p>\n<figure>\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Clipboard-Action-Key.png?w=768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Clipboard Action Key\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><br \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>This is especially powerful for users that have an external keyboard that they use with their iOS device. I&#8217;ve been using <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/things-i-like-volume-1\/\">one<\/a> for a while, and I don&#8217;t think I could ever go back. For example, I use <code>\u2318+shift+C<\/code> for my &#8220;Clipboard&#8221; Action Set, which gives me a number of actions to use and manipulate text with the system clipboard. This gives me more power than the traditional <code>\u2318+C<\/code> for copy. They key is hidden from the Enhanced Keyboard, which de-clutters the row.<\/p>\n<p>I currently have 4 Action Lists in my current Drafts setup. I don&#8217;t have Action Keys set for most of them yet, but I&#8217;m working towards having them for all of my most-used Actions and Action Sets.<\/p>\n<figure>\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Drafts-Action-Lists.png?w=768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Action Lists\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><br \/>\n<\/figure>\n<p>If you need another reason to set up Action Lists &amp; Sets: look at <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Drafts-Mega-Action-List.png\">this picture<\/a> for the individual actions I have in Drafts in one long list.
