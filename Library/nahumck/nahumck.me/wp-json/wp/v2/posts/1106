I&#8217;ve been wanting to do one for a long time, and I&#8217;m thankful that I&#8217;m finally able to do that with my friend <a title=\"Seth Clifford\" href=\"http:\/\/sethclifford.me\">Seth<\/a>. Now that it&#8217;s been out for a bit, I thought I&#8217;d share a bit about my setup.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nI&#8217;m starting out in this space; I went with some equipment that, while not the top end, is widely recommended for a beginner: the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B002VA464S\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Blue Yeti microphone<\/a>. I ended up getting one on Amazon Prime Day, as well as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B008AOH1O6\/?tag=nahumck-20\">DragonPad pop filter<\/a>. My initial plan was to use 2 iOS devices: an iPhone 5c for the FaceTime call and my iPhone Plus for recording, utilizing the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01F7KJDIM\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Lightning to USB3 adapter<\/a> to record my end using <a title=\"Ferrite Recording Studio on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ferrite-recording-studio\/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter\">Ferrite<\/a>.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> However, I was gifted a 2009 Mac mini, which surprisingly still works well for recording. We use FaceTime Audio to make the call and <a title=\"Audio Hijack by Rogue Amoeba\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rogueamoeba.com\/audiohijack\/\">Audio Hijack<\/a> to record. So while I use iOS for everything in my personal life, this is the only thing for which I use a Mac.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>With my recording hardware set, I needed a good space to record. One particular area in our basement was pretty well isolated from the house, and would be a good place to start. First, I needed a decent desk. My parents brought me the unused drafting table from their house, and I was able to set it up at a good height for standing. I added some 2&#8243; scrap foam blocks and an unused piece of 3\/4&#8243; plywood to elevate the desktop to a comfortable height for me; I also added some other spare wood that I cut to length so that I could elevate the monitor a bit. I covered it with a blanket I wasn&#8217;t using to help attenuate the metallic noise from the desk itself. Though that portion of the basement is carpeted, I also bought an <a title=\"Anti-Fatigue Mat\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B017HIJ86O\/?tag=nahumck-20\">anti-fatigue mat<\/a> that helped with standing while recording.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the area was isolated from most of the noise in the house, there was still some ambient noises coming from the air conditioning ductwork above my head and the two vents into the basement on either side of me. So I got to work [over-]engineering a solution. During my research, I found a portable mic surround that would isolate the noise around the mic; rather than line the wall with foam, I thought this would be a good idea for the space. Later that day, my wife came home one day with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michaels.com\/artminds-wood-crate-carry-all\/10228808.html#start=1\">wooden crate at Michael&#8217;s<\/a>, presumably for my youngest&#8217;s toys. But the moment I saw it, I thought of creating a box to stick the Yeti into, surrounding the mic with foam in order to isolate the mic from the ambient sound.<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> After a few iterations and some on-hand materials, I had something I was happy with.<\/p>\n<p>Although the desk is a nice height for standing, the microphone wasn&#8217;t in the proper height for me to record, and I needed to elevate it. I looked around the house for unused items, rather than buying a stand or a boom arm. I ended up making a stand for it using the base for our TV that was going unused, as we had wall-mounted the TV. Using some spare plywood around the house, I was able to make up a shelf for the mic box to sit on. The mic can now be used sitting or standing, which gives me the option depending on how I&#8217;m feeling.<sup><a id=\"ffn4\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup> I&#8217;ve also added a couple of brackets to set <a title=\"Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones - Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B003LPTAYI\/?tag=nahumck-20\">my headphones<\/a> and <a title=\"Monoprice Hook and Loop Cable Ties, 60 pack - Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B008F28WB4\/?tag=nahumck-20\">cable ties<\/a> to clean up the cords a bit.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1104\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/my-podcast-setup\/image-2-4-17-5-02-pm-png-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-2-4-17-5-02-PM-1.png?fit=837%2C639&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"837,639\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Homemade Mic Box and Stand\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-2-4-17-5-02-PM-1.png?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-2-4-17-5-02-PM-1.png?fit=837%2C639&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1104 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-2-4-17-5-02-PM-1.png?resize=837%2C639&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"837\" height=\"639\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-2-4-17-5-02-PM-1.png?w=837&amp;ssl=1 837w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-2-4-17-5-02-PM-1.png?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-2-4-17-5-02-PM-1.png?resize=768%2C586&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a &#8220;pro-tip&#8221; for setting up your own space: before you go buying anything, use what you have around you.

Not only do I have a podcast space, but I also have a quieter space to write, be creative, and is a retreat that I didn&#8217;t have previously.

To minimize a lot of it (most of which was coming from the closet behind me), I had found some scrap foam and carpet remnant. I attached the carpet to the wall using a staple gun, and glued the foam to cardboard to hang behind me. Glueing the foam to cardboard didn&#8217;t turn out well, and I ended up getting some <a title=\"Elmer's 20x30x3\/16\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0006VRTZM\/?tag=nahumck-20\">foam-core poster boards<\/a>. I attached the foam using special <a title=\"NextTape Foam Adhesive Tabs, 24 pack - Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00WRQ5RVC\/?tag=nahumck-20\">foam adhesives<\/a> and are easy to apply (peel-and-stick). I affixed two <a title=\"3M Command\u00ae Hooks, 9 pack - Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B000OEJARG\/?tag=nahumck-20\">adhesive hooks<\/a> to hang each board by two small <a title=\"5\/16\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B005P1VRJM\/?tag=nahumck-20\">screw eyes<\/a> from the ceiling. I also created a board for the ceiling, using the same strategy and a small piece of chain that I had lying around. We had some standing dividers, which were useful to set to the side to help minimize noise on the sides. With all of this set up, I basically ended up making a small studio.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1105\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/my-podcast-setup\/image-5-1-17-11-59-am-png-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?fit=2688%2C4032&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2688,4032\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"The Final Setup\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?fit=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?fit=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1105 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?w=600&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?w=2688&amp;ssl=1 2688w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?resize=768%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?resize=683%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 683w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?resize=1200%2C1800&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Image-5-1-17-11-59-AM-1.png?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really happy with how all of this turned out.
