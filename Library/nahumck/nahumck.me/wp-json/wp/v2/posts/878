I do enjoy cooking because it&#8217;s therapeutic most of the time.

What used to take me 45+ minutes to do by hand now takes 10 minutes, including cleanup, with this tool. It&#8217;s an attachment for our KitchenAid mixer, which does all the hard work.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>This is easily my favorite thing I&#8217;ve had in the kitchen in a long time, and makes me want to create new things all the time.
