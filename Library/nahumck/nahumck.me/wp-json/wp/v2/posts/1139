It is very easy for me to build bad habits, and I struggle to build good habits. The positive\/negative effects of habits can be far reaching, depending on the scenario. One thing that I often struggle with is my weight. I&#8217;m not morbidly obese, but I am fat. This is due to bad habits that I&#8217;ve maintained over a number of years: stress eating, bored eating, poor portion control, poor diet, not enough exercise etc. The long story short is that I don&#8217;t do enough to monitor myself and don&#8217;t exercise nearly enough; I&#8217;m not doing a good enough job at taking care of me.<\/p>\n<p>In admitting to myself that I have a problem, I talked about this with Seth on our podcast where I told him that <a title=\"Fundamentally Broken Episode 008 - I Eat My Feelings\" href=\"http:\/\/podcast.fundamentallybroken.men\/8\">I eat my feelings<\/a>. And while I understand that a lot of people do this, it&#8217;s not a sustainable thing for me to do. There are a number of reasons why I personally wanted to devote an entire episode about it, but there were two big reasons: that 1) Seth had gone through something similar before, and has spent some time building good habits which he maintains today; 2) I needed to gain some accountability.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nIt kind of sounds stupid when I start thinking about it. Why do I need to be accountable to the listeners of a podcast that I do? Why do I now need to be accountable to the people that are reading this?<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> Why can&#8217;t I be accountable to myself and to my family? When it gets down to it, I really need to be accountable to my family the most: my wife and sons count on me, and I need to be around for a long time to help them through life. I also want to be a good role model. So this isn&#8217;t a question of something that I just want to do: I have to do it.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that I talked about on the show was time management. I needed to set aside some time to do this. And with as busy as my life can be at times, the morning is open. It just requires that I wake up earlier. And since I&#8217;m going to the gym, I can just get ready for work and leave from there. The only thing that I need to do is prepare my workout and work bags the night before, plan my meals\/snacks for the next day, and get to bed early. The more I think of this, it&#8217;s really coming down to time and task management: setting aside the time to do it, and completing all the steps.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1138\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/building-habits\/image-6-28-17-10-28-am-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?fit=1242%2C1319&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1242,1319\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?fit=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?fit=964%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1138 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?w=1242&amp;ssl=1 1242w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?resize=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1 282w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?resize=768%2C816&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?resize=964%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 964w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/Image-6-28-17-10-28-AM.png?resize=1200%2C1274&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Since we recorded that show, I&#8217;ve been to the gym at least 3 times a week; I&#8217;m now in the fourth week, and I feel like the habit is there. I&#8217;m getting things set up the night before with my bag and clothing, and getting to bed earlier. I&#8217;m not seeing significant weight loss yet, and I don&#8217;t expect to anytime soon.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> But what I am feeling is more energy throughout the day when I work out; the off days aren&#8217;t as energized, but I feel better than I did before. I&#8217;m generally feeling better with everything in life. I&#8217;m able to handle stress better. I just <em>feel<\/em> better.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to follow some of what Seth said, even though he isn&#8217;t a nutritionist or personal trainer. He&#8217;s more of a personal productivity advisor and life coach.<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> I&#8217;m not setting out to hit quantitative metrics: I don&#8217;t care about tracking my calories; I don&#8217;t care exactly how many minutes I&#8217;m working out; I&#8217;m not tracking my weight every day\/week\/month. I&#8217;m going go by qualitative goals rather than quantitative: Do I feel better? Do clothes fit better? Do I have more energy? Do I have less anxiety? Am I building stamina in my workouts, and improving my fitness overall? If I&#8217;m hitting all of those, I&#8217;m doing the right thing. Hopefully over time, I can build the healthy habit to get healthier and more active. And if I can accomplish this and stick with it, then that takes all of the things I once thought to be impossible in my life and makes them possible if I want them to be.
