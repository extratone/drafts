But this also means doing something that I&apos;m learning to live with: <strong><em>letting go<\/em><\/strong>. I&apos;m in a weird space with work: I&apos;m acting like a boss, but I&apos;m not quite official in the title.<sup id=\"fnref-1615-promotion\"><a href=\"#fn-1615-promotion\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> It&apos;s a trial run. And for the most part, I feel like I&apos;ve been doing a great job in handling it. When it comes to taking some time for me and letting that stuff be handled by others, I&apos;ve noticed that it&apos;s difficult for me.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&apos;t officially managed others before, but I&apos;m getting the opportunity to manage my peers and others through my role. It&apos;s been a unique experience to visibly see the transition from someone who &apos;does&apos; to someone who &apos;manages&apos;. And being honest: that transition is much harder than I thought it would be. It&apos;s a learning curve of ones self to let it go and get done, instead of doing.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, I&apos;ve set some lofty goals and personal standards for myself. These aren&apos;t always shared in the same way by the people I work with. There are some ways I conduct myself that others might not.<sup id=\"fnref-1615-better\"><a href=\"#fn-1615-better\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> And it&apos;s hard to sometimes rely on others to complete assignments to your own personal standards. Hopefully I&apos;ve laid out expectations and imparted what little wisdom I can to empower my supporting team to get everything completed while I&apos;m away.<\/p>\n<p>But there are times that you still have to be a &apos;doer&apos;. You <em>do<\/em> have to let go, and trust that it&apos;s going to get done. The work will still be there when I get back. The building will still be around. The job will still need to be done. But I&apos;m hoping that I can entrust some of my work to others and have them pick up the torch while I&apos;m taking some time for me. I&apos;m hopeful that come Monday, I&apos;ll be able to realize that this is ok and that I don&apos;t have as much to worry about as I think I do.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1615-promotion\">\nI really do hope that a promotion is coming.
