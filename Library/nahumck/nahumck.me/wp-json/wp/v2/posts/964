One of the important parts I came up with in the article he posted was the use of a dictionary\u00a0to produce a list, which is helpful in so many things and a &#8220;damned creative&#8221; way of doing it, as he put in. Using this same idea, I improved <a title=\"Call Workflow Example\" href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/2563ac9600dc4ba5b474f3e7f80f545a\">a workflow<\/a> that I had made for my frequent contacts, pulling from a plain-text dictionary\u00a0of names and numbers instead of listing out a menu and contacts, while also leaving the option to input a number to call. I made an additional one for the doctors and pharmacies we use. And I plan on creating more.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"963\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/gaining-experience\/image-1-7-17-10-03-am-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?fit=2808%2C1655&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2808,1655\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Call Workflow Example\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?fit=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?fit=1024%2C604&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-963 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?w=2808&amp;ssl=1 2808w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?resize=300%2C177&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?resize=768%2C453&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?resize=1024%2C604&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?resize=1200%2C707&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Image-1-7-17-10-03-AM.png?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I was really pleased with myself for coming up with this idea. But here&#8217;s the thing: I have done this kind of list lookup before, however, it was used for a completely different purpose. I had previously posted about a <a title=\"Second Screen - nahumck.me\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/second-screen\/\">Today workflow<\/a> that helps me see my daily agenda ok my Apple Watch. In that workflow, I had a part that used a dictionary which <a title=\"Time Format Example\" href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/985adf6fa08a484cb8dd0d83113c7ba2\">formatted the time<\/a> of events or reminders: it would change a give time of <code>12:00 AM<\/code> to <code>12\u2070\u2070a<\/code>. I did this because, well, that&#8217;s just how I like to see the times. As I was working the idea of these clipboard snippet workflows out in my head, it dawned on me to try the same method to replace text with a link. After trying some different things, I ended up creating something that was even better than I had hoped. I had taken something from before, changed it up, and made it work for me in a new way. Keeping text files that I can change and pull from in iCloud Drive isn&#8217;t a new concept, but using it in this way has elevated what I&#8217;m doing and made it more powerful for many other productivity workflows.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a kid, I thought my dad was the smartest technical person I knew. He had such a breadth of knowledge about a lot of things: cars, home repair, gardening, etc. And while I know my dad is incredibly smart, what I&#8217;ve come to learn as I&#8217;ve gotten older is that he has the intelligence as well as the <em>experience<\/em>. Having the experience from previous situations or obstacles and knowing how those were solved before can make all the difference in the world. He could look at anything like a puzzle, break it down to its parts, and then work to build it up and make it a functioning whole. And I feel like I have learned a lot from him in this regard, and still often learn now that I&#8217;m older.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I have a wonderful community of like-minded nerds who challenge me and help me to learn new things or new methods of working. And some of them have become great friends &#8211; even best friends \u2014 that foster the creativity within me to use the tools that I already have or learn new ones to apply in different ways, create new methods, and solve other problems. The reality of my circle of friends and the greater productivity world I poke around in: I&#8217;m not the smartest person when it comes to this stuff, nor will I ever claim to be. There are <a title=\"Federico Viticci\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\">other<\/a> <a title=\"Ari Weinstein\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/arix\">highly-capable<\/a>, <a title=\"Stephen Millard\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sylumer\">intelligent<\/a> <a title=\"Jordan Merrick\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jordanmerrick\">individuals<\/a> who have more experience than me at putting the pieces together to create amazing workflows. But I&#8217;m always gaining the experience necessary to improve, put things together into something new, and be able to create some useful workflows of my own. I started out not knowing what I could do with Drafts and Workflow to using it daily, unsure of how I&#8217;d live without them. They really have taken my personal productivity to another level.<\/p>\n<p>As Seth said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I realize it seems circuitous and somewhat silly, but the whole point of all of this is to <strong>play and learn.<\/strong> \u2026 these small excursions also allow me to think through problems and find new ways to solve them. \u2026 These are the little puzzles I like to solve.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Personal growth can come from a lot of different places. And in my life thus far, nothing has made me grow more as a person than gaining experience. It has allowed me to learn as I go and further my personal and professional lives in positive ways. It allows me to have new insight into different puzzles that need to be solved, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what my experience helps me do for the next one.<\/p>\n<ol id=\"footnotes\">\n<li id=\"fn1\">If not, seriously.
