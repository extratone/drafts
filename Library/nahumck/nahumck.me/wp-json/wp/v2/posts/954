There were several different fields that he wanted:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none; margin: 50px;\">\n<li>Beer Name<\/li>\n<li>Beer Style<\/li>\n<li>Brewery Name<\/li>\n<li>Grade<\/li>\n<li>ABV \/ IBU<\/li>\n<li>Notes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We went back and forth on a few different iterations. Then I had a follow-up request from another friend <a title=\"Nate Boateng on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nateboateng\">Nate<\/a>. He wondered if it was possible to get the text input or the button that is pressed in a prompt step within Drafts. It took me a little bit to figure out how, but by placing a script after the prompt step, I was able to extract either the button selected <em>or<\/em> the text passed from the prompt step. I could go on about how useful this is for other multi-step actions, but I&#8217;ll save that for a different day. You can view the example of just that part <a title=\"Prompt Input - Drafts Action Directory\" href=\"http:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1vd\">here<\/a> if you want experiment.<\/p>\n<p>What I ended up creating was an action containing multiple prompt steps that recreates some of the text fields of <a title=\"Drafts TapCellar\" href=\"https:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1vo\">TapCellar<\/a>, using Drafts and Dropbox.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> If you follow how I set up the action, you can easily add additional prompt steps to further add information you&#8217;d like to have. Additionally, I&#8217;ve formatted it the way I like it, and made it so that when the image links are appended, they are at the end of the draft; this can, however, be changed to suit your needs as well.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"952\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/drafts-tapcellar\/image-12-30-16-10-50-pm-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?fit=1136%2C978&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1136,978\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Drafts TapCellar Action Steps\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?fit=300%2C258&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?fit=1024%2C882&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-952 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?resize=1100%2C947&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1100\" height=\"947\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?w=1136&amp;ssl=1 1136w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?resize=300%2C258&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?resize=768%2C661&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/Image-12-30-16-10-50-PM.png?resize=1024%2C882&amp;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In addition to creating a draft with the information, I can use an <a title=\"Add Beer Photo(s) - Drafts Action Directory\" href=\"https:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1vm\">action<\/a> that I tweaked from my <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/rolling-your-own\">daily journaling<\/a> that utilizes <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/workflow-powerful-automation\/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter\">Workflow<\/a> to take an image, upload it to Dropbox, and save the link into Drafts. <a title=\"TapCellar \u2022 Photo(s)\" href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/093d7e3c77a64c82a00c35426a0065bc\">This workflow<\/a> allows me to add images and keep it all in the same space.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> I can <a title=\"Journal Preview - Drafts Action Directory\" href=\"https:\/\/drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com\/a\/1vk\">preview the entry<\/a> if I wish in HTML, which will give me the text along with an inline image.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_1244-e1483238765978.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"958\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/drafts-tapcellar\/img_1244\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_1244-e1483238765978.jpg?fit=768%2C1328&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"768,1328\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_1244\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_1244-e1483238765978.jpg?fit=173%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_1244-e1483238765978.jpg?fit=592%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-958\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_1244.jpg?resize=173%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"173\" height=\"300\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I did also work to create a workflow that will do all of this, however, the preview of it is not as good. As a person who uses Drafts every day, I&#8217;d prefer using the separate actions. Additionally, if you keep the entries in Drafts and apply a filter, you can search within Drafts for them, rather than having to view them in Dropbox, which won&#8217;t give you the preview. If you are interested in the workflow I created, you can find it <a title=\"TapCellar\" href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/3f7e93ef16904118b87425a95113496a\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sad to see TapCellar go. I&#8217;m not a beer guy in the slightest and the app wouldn&#8217;t have been useful to me, but I like it when people who make great software succeed.
