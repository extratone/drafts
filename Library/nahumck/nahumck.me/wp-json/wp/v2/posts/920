I tried <strike>too many<\/strike> task management apps to see how different things fared. I loved my solution, but I wanted to see what else was out there. Then I <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/bifurcation\">bifurcated<\/a> my tasks and used two apps. Splitting my brain in this way was tough, but has been extremely rewarding.<\/p>\n<p>A few months later, I found myself with an Apple Watch.<!--more--> Now that I have an extension of my phone always on me, I started realizing a few different things with my tasks. When I take work out of the equation and only focus on the things I have to do at home, I really don&#39;t have a lot of tasks to manage. In fact, it&#39;s almost scary the amount of tasks I don&#39;t need to constantly parse through when it&#39;s locked away in another app. I&#39;ve even started and am actively going through and refactoring my home tasks to ensure that I am not missing anything.<\/p>\n<p>I ended up also liking different experiences once I started using the Watch. Having things like a good watch app or a good complication can really make an impactful difference. I&#39;ve started using different weather apps, different navigation apps, different Twitter apps than I did before \u2014 and it&#39;s really had a profound impact on the way I think of all of this. In fact, I have a secret that will surprise many of you: I&#39;ve actually been using Reminders for all of my home tasks for the last few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty with Reminders is that the app is generally good anywhere in the Apple ecosystem, and it is really fantastic on the Watch. And because I&#39;m not managing so many tasks in my personal life, it&#39;s been working out really well. Need a grocery item? Add it via Siri. Need to remember a key task in a meeting? Send it from my meeting notes in <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts-quickly-capture-notes\/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter\" title=\"Drafts on the App Store\">Drafts<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/fantastical-2-for-iphone-calendar\/id718043190?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter\" title=\"Fantastical 2 (iPhone) on the App Store\">Fantastical<\/a>, use natural language parsing, and load that into Reminders. The fact that many apps can tie into Reminders is nice.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> I can envision improvements to Reminders, just like in Notes, that would make Reminders a more powerful application for many. There are small changes that could be made to improve it,<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> and I hope that some of them actually make it in to a future release.<\/p>\n<p>The other thing I&#39;ve noticed: in the complexity that is my life, having something simple and basic is refreshing, yet terrifying. I&#39;ve upended a lot of different apps that I use, and even though it&#39;s taken me down scary thought experiments and upended my daily device interactions \u2014 it&#39;s changed me for the better to do so. I&#39;m constantly tempted to switch everything back, but have resisted the urge in favor of the simplicity, at least for now.<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;ve still been keeping up on <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/2do\/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=ntwitter\" title=\"2Do on the App Store\">2Do<\/a>, used the betas for testing, and I have a long, long list for features and improvements I&#39;d like to see.  It&#39;s still my favorite task management app on iOS. And I&#39;m <strong>really<\/strong> excited to see what happens for the next big release. That will likely pull me back into that camp, and I&#39;ll be in love all over again. But for now, using a stock iOS app has helped me think of how I can manage my tasks a little more simply and gain better understanding for what I <em>need<\/em> to have in order to pacify my infantile, fickle mind.<\/p>\n<p>And the same can be said for Calendar and Mail. I&#39;ve used other apps for a long time. And little by little, the stock apps have become better, and are on the verge of being great. If Mail.app would just get a damn share sheet and Gmail push notifications, I&#39;d never think twice about using it. However, I&#39;ve noticed that by not having the notifications has made things better with respect to email. So, maybe it&#39;s actually a good thing. Ok, fine. I really just need a share sheet.<\/p>\n<p>But back to the point \u2014 I&#39;m really shocked at how well things have improved after months or years away from using the Apple apps, and it really has been a nice experience using the integrated solution in iOS and watchOS. I&#39;m changing the way I&#39;m doing things, and optimizing my life to do more, with less reliance on other services.<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup> I&#39;ve gone from using tons of 3rd-party apps to using Mail, Calendar, Reminders, Notes, Maps, etc. \u2014 and it&#39;a an oddly wonderful feeling. I don&#39;t recognize this person is that I&#39;m seeing in the mirror (or on my homescreen), but he seems ok for the most part. And it&#39;s a nice change for this five minutes. I think I&#39;ll keep him around a while, until something else changes.<\/p>\n<ol id=\"footnotes\">\n<li id=\"fn1\">One point of order here: I realize that I can use 2Do with Reminders sync. But the point of this is to use the stock app. I don&#39;t want to muddy the waters and lose the Dropbox sync. I&#39;ve even made a few different w-flows in Workflow to move things back at the press of a couple buttons to make sure that I can move back quickly. <a href=\"#ffn1\">&#8617;<\/a><\/li>\n<li id=\"fn2\">Yes, like a good iOS beta tester, I&#39;ve sent in suggestions using the Feedback app. <a href=\"#ffn2\">&#8617;<\/a><\/li>\n<li id=\"fn3\">Hell, I&#39;m even considering just using iCloud Drive and ditching Dropbox.  <a href=\"#ffn3\">&#8617;<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the summer, I experimented with a lot of different app configurations.
