We were seen almost right away, and everything started to be on track. The staff noticed a few decelerations in his heartbeat, but nothing abnormal. Then it went lower.

Unless you included all of the last 3 weeks of false labor contractions, this would be anything but long. As we waited to be fully admitted, his heart rate kept getting lower. Twenty minutes pass, and they come in to break her water so they can read his heart beat. Then it was time to go get him out<sup>2<\/sup>; it was too risky to do things the natural way, the way we had planned and practiced. We wanted to be calm, peaceful, and have him next to us from the start. But he, like his parents, was impatient had other plans.<\/p>\n<p>From the time they said they were going to admit us to the time that he was born was 32 minutes. They allowed me to see him 15 min later, after knowing that my wife was ok, and that we had a healthy baby boy.<\/p>\n<p>I cannot tell you the plethora of emotions that flowed through me those first moments of meeting him. He seemed so small (7lbs 1oz), so fragile, yet so full of potential. I knew what loving another person on this earth meant, but I had no idea how it was going to affect me.
