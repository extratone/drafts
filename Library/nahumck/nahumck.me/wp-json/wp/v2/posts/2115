One of them is <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1236254471?uo=4&#038;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts<\/a>, and how we are using it for small life improvements here and there. Journaling is one of them, and it has become a part of standard practice for me. I don&#8217;t always have to put something in that&#8217;s poignant, but I do document quite a bit from time to time. I&#8217;m not perfect at it, but I try to do the best that I can. After all, it&#8217;s for me \u2013\u00a0so if I don&#8217;t do well at it, I&#8217;m only disappointing myself\u2026<\/p>\n<p>I journal using Drafts because I trust the system. Using Shortcuts, I run an automation in the morning to create the entry at 4:00am so I never miss a day; this entry is created in a specific format with the <code>journal<\/code> tag, date heading in <code>yyyy-mm-dd<\/code> format, and some weather and date information. I have another automation that runs just before midnight to save it as a nice-looking PDF at night and archive the draft. I still keep all the journal entries in Drafts: they live in my Journal workspace in the archive folder at the top of the drafts list. I keep them just in case I need to search for something later, even though I hardly do it. But there are times where I might want to go back and review them just to see what happened in the past. One of Seth&#8217;s problems was that he wanted a way to review things that happened on that day throughout the life of his digital journal. We used to use Shortcuts to do this, but that&#8217;s cumbersome at best. Why use another app when Drafts is perfectly suited for this? Seth ended up finding <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.getdrafts.com\/t\/tip-use-temporary-workspaces-to-filter-the-draft-list\/3030\">this forum tip<\/a> on creating temporary workspaces, which admittedly was from a while ago (November <em>2018<\/em>). Even though a lot of you think I&#8217;m an expert, there&#8217;s quite a bit of this stuff that I don&#8217;t know or use.<\/p>\n<p>Using this example, I was able to create an action to show what happened <a href=\"https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1qP\">On This Date<\/a>. In simple terms, it searches for all drafts tagged <code>journal<\/code>, then searches for a string of the current date in <code>mm-dd<\/code> format; the action then has some code to let you filter the look of it, then load the workspace. I added a few things because I want to keep my Journal themes applied when creating this temporary workspace.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s walk through the code a bit. First, you&#8217;ll find some configurable variables for your searching. This sets the name of the temporary workspace, the tags you want to include (or omit using <code>!tag<\/code>), and some strings to search.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\/\/BEGIN config variables\n\/\/setup tags or searches you wish to load...\nlet name = \"On This Date\";\nlet tagFilter = \"journal\"\nconst now = new Date()\nconst date = now.toString(\"MM-dd\")\nlet queryString = date;\nlet group = ActionGroup.find(\"Journal\");\napp.loadActionGroup(group);\nlet lTheme = Theme.find(\"custom\", \"Journal Light\");\nlet dTheme = Theme.find(\"custom\", \"Journal Dark\");\n\/\/END config variables\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>I also added the action groups I use for journaling as well as my journaling themes as variables, since I want to make sure I use them later in the action. Now that all that is configured, we can set up the workspace:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\/\/create workspace\n\/\/for other options, see:\n\/\/https:\/\/reference.getdrafts.com\/objects\/Workspace.html\nlet ws = Workspace.create();\nws.name = name;\nws.tagFilter = tagFilter;\nws.queryString = queryString;\nws.setInboxSort(\"created\", true);\nws.loadFolder = \"all\";\nws.showPreview = false;\nws.showTags = false;\nws.showLastAction = false;\nws.showDate = false;\nws.loadActionBarGroup = group;\nws.loadActionListGroup = group;\n\/\/ws.lightTheme = lTheme;\n\/\/ws.darkTheme = dTheme;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>There&#8217;s a surprising amount of customization. I did find out that there was an undocumented <code>.showDate<\/code> customization that I could take advantage of. The only thing I would like to see added here is <code>.lightTheme<\/code> and <code>.darkTheme<\/code> so that I can set the themes directly with the temporary workspace which would eliminate the need for me to call them using the other methods; maybe those will get added in the future. The last part applies the workspace, shows the draft list, and applies my themes. I appreciated the callout in the original action, so I kept it in there: the workspace is temporary unless you use the <code>.update()<\/code> function, very much akin to a temporary draft to store information.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\/\/unless you call `ws.update()`, this ws is temporary\n\/\/load this workspace, and display draft list\napp.applyWorkspace(ws);\napp.showDraftList();\n\n\/\/set the Journal themes\napp.lightTheme = lTheme;\napp.darkTheme = dTheme;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Actions like this can seem like a lot at first, but they are fairly simple enough to manage. This action can bring a lot of awareness and possibly even some joy to your day, looking back on the things you&#8217;ve done in the past. I&#8217;ve also included this in my widgets: I&#8217;ve found that I use it more often this way, and it&#8217;s a great use of a widget action for Drafts.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>I have to admit, this is the first time in a while that I&#8217;ve done something like this to change some of my workflows. Not because I don&#8217;t adore Drafts, but because of how life has been going for me (all good things, thankfully). But it makes me wonder: <em>what else am I missing<\/em>? Seems like a great time to go exploring\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even though Seth and I no longer have a podcast, we still talk nearly daily about a lot of things.
