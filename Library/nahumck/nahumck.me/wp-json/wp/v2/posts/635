We want to protect it (some of us, anyway), but we want the value that sharing it can provide us. We want the future we were promised in our childhoods, but the changes we find occurring around us can be discomforting. This kind of change is everywhere, and it continues to move like perpetual motion, unstoppable. It\u2019s beautiful and frightening. But it is inevitable.\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree with him more. This change is coming whether we want it or not. Watching <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation<\/em> when I was a kid, I was fascinated with how the computer would pick up a command, even if Scotty&#8217;s accent was thick and it&#8217;s hard to understand.<a href=\"#fn-1\" id=\"fnref-1\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[1]<\/a> I wanted that in my life then, and it&#8217;s taken years to get there. And we&#8217;re really at the start of where this is headed.<\/p>\n<p>Having alternative methods of approach is a good thing, and is the way humans (and groups of humans) approach problem solving: you may have a solution in mind, while others might approach the problem in a completely different manner. You may use an app like <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes\/id905337691?at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">Drafts 4<\/a>, while others use <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/workflow-powerful-automation\/id915249334?at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">Workflow<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/pythonista\/id528579881?at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">Pythonista<\/a> to get the same thing done, and vice versa. The specific difficulty with machine learning is that people are complex, and can have entirely different ways of thinking.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not looking at who&#8217;s going to win or lose this perceived battle: I think there&#8217;s going to be multiple ways of solving multiple problems, and the users will just have to find what&#8217;s right for them, just like we do with iPhone vs Android.
