I&#8217;m not sure how long it will take to get there. There isn&#8217;t a set timeline for when I will fully be able to share, with any confidence, who I am and what I want to say. But that is ok.

Aaron Mahnke had some great words on Twitter this week in the wake of a successful book launch and his podcast (emphasis mine):<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\" width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I see one decision at the root of the incredible ride I\u2019ve had since April: I stopped trying to be like everyone else and embraced \u201c<em>me<\/em>\u201d. Scoff if you want. Make fun of the \u201cHallmark-ness\u201d of that revelation. That\u2019s cool. But maybe stop and ask yourself why you\u2019re scoffing. I thought I had to be an Apple-blogger-tech-opinionator-profound-thinker-productivity-guy. But that\u2019s not me.

It seems that anyone that I can look up to for inspiration, regardless of their craft, has done so by sharing their passion. Sure, there <em>could<\/em> be acclaim and financial success, but they find success by being themselves by sharing what they love with the world. You don&#8217;t have to be the next big thing. You don&#8217;t have to be like other people. You just need to be <em>you<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>I think for most, being yourself is one of the hardest things to do as a human. It takes a lot to get out of your own way, remove the internal barriers, and open up your world to others. We allow ourselves to be defined rather than define ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the toughest part for me: how do I define myself? I don&#8217;t yet know the answer. It won&#8217;t be quick, and it certainly won&#8217;t be easy \u2014 but I know that being myself and sharing it with others will be the biggest payoff in my success. <\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>You can find out how to order Aaron&#8217;s books on his <a href=\"http:\/\/aaronmahnke.com\/\">website<\/a>.<br \/>\nLore can be found in <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/lore\/id978052928?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">iTunes<\/a> or on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lorepodcast.com\/\">website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\nwith native ads, not the crazy insane banner adds that are everywhere <a href=\"#fnref-1\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I&#8217;m creating this new space, I often think of what I can do to make it better for everyone reading.
