I suppose that&#8217;s the nature of a parent. Or maybe I&#8217;m getting older and these are things that happen. Or maybe it&#8217;s a global pandemic and a global call to end systemic racism. Maybe it&#8217;s all of these things, and probably a whole lot more. But I find that in these times, I often end up finding my way.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Life, for the most part, has been really great for me. I know that with all that is going on in the world, this is a hard thing to say. But given where I&#8217;ve been over the past few years, I&#8217;m in a really good place. The past has given way to new opportunities and better choices for my life. I am in a new relationship that is healthy and fulfilling. I&#8217;ve received not one but two promotions in the last year, and I feel like I&#8217;m where I need to be with my job.<sup id=\"fnref-1813-up\"><a href=\"#fn-1813-up\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> I&#8217;m even down 20 lbs now, and working on the next 20. I&#8217;m starting to hit a stride for my life with which I&#8217;m comfortable.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, there were some things that were not happening. My personal projects \u2013 my writing and <a href=\"http:\/\/fundamentallybroken.men\">my podcast<\/a> \u2013\u00a0have been on hiatus for a while. I felt like my creative energy was zapped, that I didn&#8217;t have the desire to do these things anymore. I&#8217;m not sure if it was depression or a culmination of things, but I just didn&#8217;t <em>feel<\/em> creative anymore. I felt unmoored while trying to navigate my creative life.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s in these times that I turn my focus to my journal, so I can start to figure out what it really is that&#8217;s driving me. <em>Why am I writing? Why am I podcasting? Do people enjoy this? Does that matter? Who am I writing or speaking to when I share my thoughts?<\/em> At the end of it all, I have to ask: <em>What&#8217;s my why?<\/em> <sup id=\"fnref-1813-Sinek\"><a href=\"#fn-1813-Sinek\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>This question set me down multiple paths. I sat alone with my thoughts, figuring out what I wanted to do. My initial thought was to stop. Stop writing. Stop podcasting. Do things for me, and forget it all. I don&#8217;t owe it to anyone to continue these things. If I don&#8217;t want to do them, then I can just hang it up and walk away. These thoughts consumed me for weeks.<\/p>\n<p>But in my journaling and even in discussions with others, I found myself pulled another direction. I started thinking of the <em>why<\/em> for my writing. And really, it comes down to what it started to be: I write for me, and me alone. What I have learned over my time of writing is that people seem to enjoy what I write for myself. I&#8217;m honestly shocked most of the time that it even makes sense, people enjoy it, and \u2013\u00a0much to my shock \u2013\u00a0it even gets requested at times.<\/p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m going to be doing some things to return to form. I&#8217;m starting to write again, and it&#8217;s pouring out of me. I&#8217;m going back to the approach I took when I first started: write for myself, and then publish. Some of my stuff might be small, some of it larger. But it&#8217;s going to be on the subjects and topics that I want. Over the coming weeks, you&#8217;ll see some posts about my favorite app Drafts: the posts aren&#8217;t going to be a regurgitation of the release notes nor will I cover everything. But what I will do is cover particular things that speak to me in the various releases. And this is how I will generally approach most things going forward. If I&#8217;m being honest with myself, this is what I should have done all along.<\/p>\n<p>With this renewed focus, I decided to update the site a bit. I commissioned a new look and overhaul of the site from top to bottom, which was done by the amazing <a href=\"https:\/\/jandmlab.com\/\">Jeff Mueller<\/a>. I also got to collaborate with <a href=\"https:\/\/jeffperry.blog\">Jeff Perry<\/a> to create a logo for my site. These are two things that I have wanted to do, but did not have the time or the creative energy to develop properly. I&#8217;d rather have these things taken care of for me than do them myself, and that&#8217;s ok. This also helps me recommit to the future of my site, my writing, and my creative life in general.<sup id=\"fnref-1813-post\"><a href=\"#fn-1813-post\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>I hope that this is a new beginning. By reframing my mind, I&#8217;m freeing myself of guilt and returning to the positive mindset that allows me to be creative. I&#8217;ve gone through the questions and come out on the other side with the answers. As I wrote recently:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Sometimes we question what is important. I now realize how vital it is to question \u2013\u00a0but not doubt \u2013\u00a0your motives as to why you do something and why you might want to continue. I&#8217;m not afraid of this process, but rather I embrace it.
