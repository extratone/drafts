They were before, in smaller circles, but the broad success of podcasts like <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/serial\/id917918570?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Serial<\/a> have pushed the medium to new listeners, new listener numbers, and therefore new boundaries. High-profile individuals have started reaching out to appear on podcasts. Phil Schiller of Apple went on <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/ep.-123-live-from-wwdc-2015\/id528458508?i=344459403&amp;mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">The Talk Show with John Gruber<\/a> where he knew he could be asked some tough questions, but wanted to show that he was one of us. Even the POTUS (or his team) thinks that being on <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/episode-613-president-barack\/id329875043?i=345340403&amp;mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">a podcast<\/a> is worthwhile.<\/p>\n<p>When I first started getting into podcasts, I listened to topics I enjoyed; but the playlist was <strong><em>heavily<\/em><\/strong> dominated with tech podcasts. I had somewhere between 10-15 of them [footnote]I wish I was joking[\/footnote] a week that I would listen to. I would use  <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/overcast-podcast-player\/id888422857?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Overcast<\/a> and use its Smart Speed\u00ae functionality in addition to playing them at 1.5x-2x the normal speed to increase my intake [footnote]playing catch-up, really[\/footnote]; but after a while, they became dull and boring. They didn&#39;t move and excite my brain like they used to.<\/p>\n<p>I started discussing with several of my friends, and we all seem to agree: the tech podcast space has become repetitive, too filled with the same things being regurgitated across multiple places. What&#39;s being said on one podcast is being said on another; often times, there would be a discussion by the same person on different podcasts. This isn&#39;t to say that they aren&#39;t <em>good<\/em>: there are a lot of amazing technology focused podcasts out there. For myself and others, it was simply becoming overwhelming to keep up on a regular basis, and too repetitive show-to-show.<\/p>\n<p>Out of those discussions, I started to  develop some questions to gauge how I to listen to podcasts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Am I learning anything new?<\/li>\n<li>Do I always enjoy listening to the topics, hosts, and guests?<\/li>\n<li>Do I enjoy listening at 1x? Or, maybe better said: Do I feel like I need to speed up the podcast? <\/li>\n<li>How do I feel when I am done listening to the podcast? Happy? Sad? Meh?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If the podcast doesn&#39;t give me the positive answers to those questions, it gets deleted. This may seem harsh, but it really makes a difference in de-cluttering my headspace. If I feel &ldquo;meh&rdquo; after a podcast, it likely isn&#39;t worth listening to. I would be better off playing music or checking out something new.<\/p>\n<p>What I really want from podcasts &#8211; and tech podcasts in particular &#8211; is a fresh take on topics, saying things others aren&#39;t and looking for new angles; I also want interesting ideas and subjects to keep me engaged. I still listen to a few tech podcasts, but only subscribe to a couple; the rest are selected based on guests and\/or topics.<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of recommendations in the past few months that have been providing me with just the thing I want to hear, even if I didn&#39;t know I wanted to hear it. Here are some of the podcasts I&#39;ve been enjoying as of late:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/99-invisible\/id394775318?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">99% Invisible by Roman Mars<\/a> is a great show about the history of design, and all the little things you tend to miss or overlook. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>You cannot go wrong with the absolutely terrifying <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/lore\/id978052928?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Lore<\/a> by Aaron Mahnke. The episode entitled <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/episode-8-the-castle\/id978052928?i=344803013&amp;mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">&ldquo;The Castle&rdquo;<\/a> was horrifying, sick, and extremely twisted, but a great episode that was very well produced. [footnote]Lore is one of the few podcasts for which I have a notification set &#8211; it&#39;s great.[\/footnote]<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/front-to-back\/id945174610?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Front to Back<\/a> is about 3 dads raising their daughters, but having a daughter of your own is hardly a prerequisite. They have many great insights to parenting that I have found useful. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/criminal\/id809264944?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Criminal<\/a> contains fascinating stories of people that are or have been viewed as criminals; some of them have been unbelievable and heart-wrenching. The exit guide episode is a good place to start. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/mystery-show\/id952044185?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Mystery Show<\/a> is a wonderful podcast about mysteries that can&#39;t be solved by looking online. Beat reporter-style investigation and interviews tackling small mysteries. The <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/case-3-belt-buckle\/id952044185?i=344076066&amp;mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Belt Buckle<\/a> was quite possibly the single greatest podcast episode I&#39;ve ever heard. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/undisclosed-state-vs.-adnan\/id984987791?mt=2&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Undisclosed<\/a> is a follow-on to (but not associated with) Serial, which highlights more and more errors in the case. If you were a fan of Serial, this is a must-listen podcast.[footnote]Fair warning &#8211; I get upset every week at this case. It&#39;s a disaster that I cannot believe was this poorly handled \u2013 the prosecution handle this whole trial wrong, and the initial defense was ineffective. I&#39;m hoping there is a new trial opened.[\/footnote]<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I&#39;m always in search of other quality podcasts: if you have some other suggestions, <a href=\"twitter.com\/nahumck\">let me know what you think I should be listening to<\/a>. I will give them a chance, but I will be applying the rules to those as well \u2014 so make them good!<\/p>\n<p>Cleaning up and clearing out my podcast playlist has lead me to a more fulfilling experience; I highly suggest you take a look at doing the same. It&#39;s time to give your podcast listening a more personal human touch.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Podcasts are becoming increasingly validated as a medium.
