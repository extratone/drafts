That has served me very well, and something that I have <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/piques-of-the-week-volume-10\/\">really enjoyed<\/a>. But there are a lot of times when I&#8217;m just going around the house where the added heft of the functional case really didn&#8217;t work well. I started to remove the iPad from the case fairly often, but lost some functionality.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s when I thought to pick up the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01DOQR680\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Smart Cover for iPad Pro 9.7<\/a>. Not only does the Smart Cover allow for protection of the screen, but it also can prop up the device in two modes: the &#8220;viewing&#8221; mode and the &#8220;typing&#8221; mode.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> The viewing mode allows me to FaceTime with family, watch a show or two, or read the news if I feel like screaming into the void. The typing mode allows me to respond to people without having my device in a heavier case; this does require me using the on-screen keyboard, however. I can also pair the device with my magic keyboard for longer writing, which might come in handy for a large fall review that I&#8217;ll be working on.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1153\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/piques-of-the-week-volume-12\/image-8-12-17-11-53-am-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?fit=2000%2C937&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2000,937\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?fit=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?fit=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1153 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?w=768&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?w=2000&amp;ssl=1 2000w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-12-17-11-53-AM.png?resize=1200%2C562&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll even store my pencil up at the top, which is secured by the magnets. The pencil also fits in the groove on the front of the Smart Cover, but I&#8217;m nervous about it falling off and me losing it; it&#8217;s not something I often do while moving about, but while it&#8217;s on my desk or on my counter, I will keep it around.<\/p>\n<p>If I had the choice to do it over again, I might have picked up the <a href=\"#\">Smart Keyboard<\/a>, but I like having the options. Using the on-screen keyboard has showing me that the larger devices might be better suited for that use case; either way, if I upgraded to the larger size, I&#8217;d likely get the Smart Cover for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B071WLJW7Z\/?tag=nahumck-20\">10.5<\/a> \/ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B071JNCP9W\/?tag=nahumck-20\">12.9<\/a>. Highly recommended for sleek carry and around the house use.<\/p>\n<h2>Akwox Silicone Cover for Siri Remote<\/h2>\n<p>With multiple devices around the TV, there comes multiple remotes. And while I could get some sort of universal remote for everything, I much prefer using the remotes that come with the devices.<\/p>\n<p>We have a small remote caddy at home, but one remote we have the most problems with is the Apple TV Siri remote: it&#8217;s always getting misplaced, and because the face is black, there&#8217;s a risk of it being lost. So rather than continuing to look around, I thought I would get a smarter solution &#8211; to Amazon!<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1152\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/piques-of-the-week-volume-12\/image-8-8-17-11-11-am-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-8-17-11-11-AM.png?fit=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"500,500\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Silicone Case for Apple TV Siri remote\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-8-17-11-11-AM.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-8-17-11-11-AM.png?fit=500%2C500&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1152 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-8-17-11-11-AM.png?w=200&#038;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-8-17-11-11-AM.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-8-17-11-11-AM.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Image-8-8-17-11-11-AM.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I did a quick search for Apple TV remote silicone case, and arrived at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01NA9TATV\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Akwox Silicone Cover for Siri Remote<\/a>.
