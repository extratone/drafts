It changed a lot about how I use my devices, my workflows, and elevated my productivity. I was able to get a lot of things done before; now, with iOS 11, I\u2019ve never been more productive. Having iOS 11 on my iPad is like having an Aston Martin DB11 and adding all of the James Bond gadgets you can handle; it becomes a much more capable machine without changing its form.<\/p>\n<p>The multitasking has taken some getting used to, but I\u2019m constantly flying between spaces and slide over. I\u2019m using different apps in slide over depending on the mode or context I\u2019m in (think social, productivity, finance, etc.), but it feels very freeing now that I have somewhat of a handle on it. As time goes on, I\u2019m sure that feeling will increase even more.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot more with iOS 11 &#8211; like the new on-screen keyboard that has the flick gesture that I want on the iPhone too &#8211; but I\u2019m going to let that be done by the <a title=\"iOS 11 - The MacStories Review\" href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-11-the-macstories-review\/\">professionals<\/a>.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> The good news of loading on the beta is that I no longer have a desire to figure out how to sell the 9.7\u201d iPad Pro to get the improved 10.5\u201d model. This thing handles everything that I throw at it, and I don\u2019t have to jump through hoops to get there, which makes me happy.<\/p>\n<p>Management of my tasks is now primarily done on the iPad; there are so many times that split screen has been a godsend for my productivity, and that is the most true when it comes to my daily task management. Having a good watch face to help me through my day had been pretty great before. I often used the Modular face with my task manager\u2019s useful complication and watch app. But with iOS 11 comes watchOS 4, and now there\u2019s a better way\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Siri Apple Watch Face<\/h2>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1177\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/keep-it-simple\/image-9-16-17-8-48-am-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?fit=484%2C872&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"484,872\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?fit=167%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?fit=484%2C872&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"484\" height=\"872\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1177 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?resize=484%2C872&#038;ssl=1\" style=\"max-width:200px;\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?w=484&amp;ssl=1 484w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-16-17-8-48-AM.png?resize=167%2C300&amp;ssl=1 167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll admit, when I first saw the watchOS 4 portion of the <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/apple-keynotes\/id275834665?mt=2\">Apple Keynote<\/a>, I wasn\u2019t really blown away by everything. As I started working out, there are were some small improvements to how the workout app behaves on the watch. And when I loaded the beta on my Watch, I discovered that I was enamored with the Siri watch face.<\/p>\n<p>A while ago, I created a <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/second-screen\/\">Today workflow<\/a>: this workflow would pull all of the information from my calendars, tasks, etc. and put it into my focus for the day. The problem with that was always this: I had to go seek the information, i.e. run the workflow. What I had always wanted was that information to automatically surface when I needed it. What I really needed was an assistant to get me my information and send it to me. I tried using Slack and IFTTT to help me with that, but it never seemed to work out the way I thought it should.<\/p>\n<p>Now I have the Siri Watch Face. It brings up my calendar, the weather, the sunrise\/sunset all in the order it\u2019s happening. It still doesn\u2019t bring up my tasks, at least not where I had them.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> I would love to see 3rd-party integrations for task managers or other calendars, weather apps like <a title=\"Carrot Weather for iOS \" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/carrot-weather\/id961390574?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Carrot Weather<\/a> or <a title=\"Weather Atlas for iOS \" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/weather-atlas-weather-radar-map-10-day-forecast\/id1196015787?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Weather Atlas<\/a>, and even an Activity card to keep track of my progress throughout the day. Opening this up to the 3rd-party ecosystem will bring powerful new tools to the user, and allow the user to use their default applications in a new way to benefit their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the Siri Watch Face is really fantastic, but there\u2019s one thing that would make it even better: <em>surfacing<\/em> my tasks for me. And to do this, I need one more thing\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Reminders + Drafts<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve been down a road like this <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/basic\/\">before<\/a>. And there were some things about it previously that didn\u2019t work for me. But there are a lot of things that have improved with the new operating system updates.<\/p>\n<p>What I realized was that although having a dedicated task management app like <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/2do-reminders-personal-planner\/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">2Do<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/omnifocus-2\/id904071710?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">OmniFocus<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/things-3\/id904237743?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Things<\/a> to house everything can be helpful, I really don\u2019t need to have a complex system. What I needed was a place to house a large list, and then a way to move some of those things that are ready into my focus and apply some triggers (reminders) to execute my next actions. I don\u2019t need a complex set of nested folders and lists; after all, I used to use a piece of paper and a pen for all of this stuff. After I sat down to figure this all out, I ended up just needing a more simple list structure: my master lists in <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts-quickly-capture-notes-share-anywhere\/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts<\/a> which provide my areas of focus, my Inbox in Reminders for focus on next actions, and my recurring list in Reminders for when I need nudges for medicine, trash, and the like. And this setup works extremely well for me on the iPad Pro in split screen.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1176\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/keep-it-simple\/image-9-19-17-9-37-pm-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1176 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?resize=1100%2C825&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1100\" height=\"825\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-9-37-PM.png?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are some challenges to using it in this way: how can I see everything that relates to my Home list now that it\u2019s split between Reminders and Drafts? Tagging. While I wish that Reminders would get the ability for tags as has been done in Files, I\u2019ll have to run with my own solution for now. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve seen before,<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> and it should help me with a lot of what I\u2019m doing. For each list, I\u2019ll tag it with a <code>x[tag]<\/code> format: for home, it will be <code>xhome<\/code>; for podcast stuff, it will be <code>xpodcast<\/code>. I\u2019ll apply this to the items in my master lists and also the reminders that I pull into my inbox. I can then use Spotlight search to view everything related to that; within the apps, I can search for them. In Drafts, I have a filter created to search for <code>xtasks<\/code>, which I have put in each focus list I have. It\u2019s a bit more work to type those tags in, but it\u2019s going to be extremely useful going forward when I need to find something quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, I tried using Drafts + Reminders.app. I would send tasks over via actions and then apply the date\/time to get them done. And while that could have worked then, for one reason or another it didn\u2019t. But now that I\u2019m a little older and little wiser, my mind has been opened slightly and I\u2019m learning about how I operate; what I\u2019ve come to realize is that I need simplicity. So with that in mind, now I can highlight my next actions\/tasks in Drafts and drag\/drop them into Reminders. From there, I can set all the things I need to do.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking: <em>why not use Notes for your lists? That has a lot to offer: search, formatting, rich links, images, etc. That seems like a better solution.<\/em> And you\u2019re right. Well, for now you\u2019re right. Part of why I want to keep Drafts as my repository for the lists is because I want to future-proof my plan. And I\u2019m hopeful that syntax highlighting comes to Drafts sooner rather than later. On the image below, I have the same list in Drafts and <a title=\"Ulysses for iOS\" href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ulysses\/id1225571038?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Ulysses<\/a>, just to show the difference it can make. The visual difference between the two is important. Now I can navigate through my lists with ease. So in the short term, I\u2019ll live with the syntax the way it looks in hopes that the next version of Drafts supports this so that it makes my life easier. If for whatever reason it doesn\u2019t, the good news is that Drafts is extensible enough and I can share this into Notes without a problem.<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1178\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/keep-it-simple\/image-9-19-17-6-04-pm-png\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?fit=2048%2C1536&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1178 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?resize=1100%2C825&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1100\" height=\"825\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Image-9-19-17-6-04-PM.png?resize=1200%2C900&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If in the future I need to expand my lists, I just simply need to create a new area of focus, tag the list appropriately, and add tasks to my Inbox in Reminders. From there, I just have to utilize my watch to help me get things accomplished. The system is good for small amounts, and I\u2019m sure it can handle even my complex projects with ease.<sup><a id=\"ffn4\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>What it comes back down to is using Drafts as a central place of capture, something I have <a title=\"Trusted Capture with Drafts\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/trusted-capture-with-drafts\/\">utilized before<\/a>. My system has changed once again, but here it is that Drafts is at its core. This small little thing has reduced the mental friction of \u201cwhere does this go\u201d. I know where it goes. It goes in the place where all of my thoughts start. I might need to send it to another place \u2014 via an action, with drag\/drop, or simple copy\/paste \u2014 and then attach a reminder, but that\u2019s ok. I can do that sort of thing on the fly without having to worry about where to start it. And for someone that can often get overwhelmed with how much there is to do with all that life throws at me, knowing that I can start in Drafts is a huge key to any success I have with my <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">tasks<\/span> life. Using Drafts in conjunction with native apps has led to bigger and better things that I originally had planned.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m also reminded of something that <a title=\"Merlin Mann on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/hotdogsladies\">Merlin Mann<\/a> often says on his multitude of podcasts (paraphrasing):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Try just talking to your dingus. Use Siri. Use the new features. Use the apps that you haven\u2019t tried in a long time. A lot of this technology has improved with time.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>He\u2019s right. Things have improved with the help of integrations over the years. And while I would absolutely <em>love<\/em> to see Reminders get the same awesome treatment that Notes has received, it\u2019s still not going to have a ton of nit-picky settings that other task managers do.<sup><a id=\"ffn5\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup> So I should try to use it the way things are intended so that I can see what I can get out of it. Does it mean that I\u2019m going to be able to manage some complex stuff? No. But it can be awesome when you start working within the ecosystem to make it work for you. You might not have a flesh-and-blood assistant, but you can have a better digital one than you\u2019ve had in the past. The more you use it, the more you figure out how to work with it, the more you are going to get out of having this virtual assistant on your wrist.<\/p>\n<p>With all of these changes, I can now manage all my tasks using my iPad Pro or iPhone running iOS 11 &#8211; my master list in Drafts, my focus list and recurring tasks in Reminders &#8211; and have it all surface for me on my Apple Watch on the Siri watch face. It puts it all there for me to look at in one scrollable view so that I can make sure I\u2019m focused on the right things. The information I\u2019ve stored is being surfaced to me. I\u2019m letting go of the preconceived notions I had about what I should be using, and thinking about the way I want to work. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by how well this is working, and it\u2019s only been a couple of weeks. How long will this last? Who knows. But I really like where this all is headed. I think I\u2019ll set a reminder for next September: \u201cHey Siri, remind me in September to keep it simple.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><small><em>This post was originally a \u201cPiques of the Week\u201d post.
