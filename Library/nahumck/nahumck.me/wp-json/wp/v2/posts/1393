Not only does it replicate the way I input events into my calendar, but it does it even faster now that it&#8217;s all native in Drafts. There is no longer a back-and-forth dance with the action to create multiple events. It runs quickly, and I can move along with what I was working on when it is completed. I can also include locations and durations as well. I can even use the calendar shortcut syntax (example: <code>\/w<\/code> for my work calendar) with the action. It is a really robust solution.<sup id=\"fnref-1393-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1393-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, Peter requested the changed in <a href=\"http:\/\/getdrafts.com\/changelog\">Drafts 5.3<\/a> which provide the same parsing for <a href=\"https:\/\/polymaths.blog\/2018\/07\/fantastically-good-reminder-parser-for-drafts-5\">reminders<\/a> as well, which replaces the other aspect of Fantastical for me. You can include the level of priority denoted by exclamation marks <code>!<\/code> and use the reminder list denoted by the same shortcut syntax as the calendar (<code>\/inbox<\/code>).<\/p>\n<p>These two actions are what I had envisioned in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/drafts-5-the-macstories-review\/4\/#gtd\">GTD module of my review<\/a>. This is a case where I knew that they were going to be possible, but I do not have the technical knowledge to create. Initially, I wanted to create one based on some unique syntax, similar to the <a href=\"http:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1Cc\">Send to Things<\/a> action.
