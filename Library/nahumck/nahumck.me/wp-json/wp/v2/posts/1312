The entire Team at MacStories has been delightful to work with, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier than I am now with everything that has transpired over the past few months. It has been an honor to work with that team!<\/p>\n<p>Writing while <a href=\"https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/agiletortoise\">Greg<\/a> was developing Drafts 5 through the beta process was a valuable insight into app development. It is rare to directly see the careful consideration an app developer makes when rolling out new features. Using the Slack channel as a sounding board, he would often listen to the suggestions being made; if he ever thought it was the wrong thing to do, he would state why instead of just &#8220;no&#8221;. I know he has more planned for the future, and I&#8217;ll be sure to follow-up when he does.<\/p>\n<p>You can read the review at the link above.
