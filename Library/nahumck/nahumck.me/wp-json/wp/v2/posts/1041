I&#8217;ve owned several vacuum-insulated tumblers in the past, but they are all plastic and break over time (especially if accidentally dropped). I looked for alternatives, and found several brands: Yeti, Rtic, and many more that are all about the same. All of them were anywhere from $15-40 for a single tumbler.<\/p>\n<p>On a recent trip to Costco, however, I found a 2-pack of the <a title=\"Reduce Cold-1 30oz tumbler (2-pack)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01L9SIHL0\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Reduce Cold-1 30oz tumblers<\/a> for $20. I thought I would give them a shot. And I&#8217;m a big believer in them now. The day I brought them home (at about 2pm) I washed them, and put ice in my tumbler. I refilled the water several times for the remainder of the day. I placed the cup next to my bedside and fell asleep. When I woke in the morning, I grabbed my tumbler and to my surprise &#8211; there was still ice in there!<\/p>\n<p>I highly recommend these if you get the chance to pick them up. I included the Amazon link, but if you live near a Costco, you can save some cash by picking them up there.<\/p>\n<h3>Rinfit Silicone Wedding Bands<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Rinfit-Silicone-Wedding-Bands.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My wife and I have never had our rings re-dipped since we&#8217;ve been married, and I thought this year would be a good year to do it. Additionally, there have been times at work that I have been messing with electrical equipment, and my wife&#8217;s rings don&#8217;t quite fit her.<\/p>\n<p>So I started looking for alternatives to wear while we get our wedding bands all fixed up. I stumbled upon the Rinfit line of silicone wedding bands. I was able to pick up a simple <a title=\"Rinfit Men's Silicone Wedding Band - Black\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01ELI7ZJU\/?tag=nahumck-20\">men&#8217;s band<\/a> in black, and picked up a multi-color pack of <a title=\"Rinfit Women's Silicone Wedding Bands - 5 pack\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01LFGQ8Y4\/?tag=nahumck-20\">women&#8217;s bands<\/a> for my wife. We are both really please with how well they fit and how they can adapt as our hands expand\/contract with heat and cold. As an added benefit, I won&#8217;t get electrical shocks from this at work. Maybe I won&#8217;t miss that metallic taste in my mouth after all\u2026<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[42],"tags":[72],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p6pMv7-gN","jetpack-related-posts":[{"id":1160,"url":"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/piques-of-the-week-volume-13\/","url_meta":{"origin":1041,"position":0},"title":"Piques of the Week &#8211; Volume 13","date":"August 20, 2017","format":false,"excerpt":"This time it's all about my luggage.","rel":"","context":"In &quot;Piques of the Week&quot;","img":{"alt_text":"","src":"","width":0,"height":0},"classes":[]},{"id":878,"url":"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/piques-of-the-week-volume-7\/","url_meta":{"origin":1041,"position":1},"title":"Piques of the Week &#8211; Volume 7","date":"September 22, 2016","format":false,"excerpt":"Some things I've been enjoying in the kitchen.","rel":"","context":"In &quot;Piques of the Week&quot;","img":{"alt_text":"","src":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Image-9-9-16-10-06-AM.jpeg?resize=350%2C200&ssl=1","width":350,"height":200},"classes":[]},{"id":1530,"url":"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/tactical-bag\/","url_meta":{"origin":1041,"position":2},"title":"Tactical Bag","date":"January 14, 2019","format":false,"excerpt":"For a while now, I've had the same backpack.
