It was a slim keyboard, not full-sized, and didn&#8217;t fit my fingers well. I never tried it, casting it aside as unusable because of how tight the keys were.<\/p>\n<p>Then, the day after Christmas, I tried it again while using my iPhone 6s Plus. It quite literally changed the way I use my device; it opened new possibilities for what I can and will do. That said, I still couldn&#8217;t use it because of the keyboard layout. I searched for alternatives, and landed on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00MUTWLW4\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B00MUTWLW4&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=nahumck-20&#038;linkId=SVASB5J6YYV52GMC\">Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The keyboard is a full-sized keyboard, with additional keys for navigation. It also gives you the option to pair it with 3 devices. I like everything about the keyboard with 3 exceptions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It doesn&#8217;t fold up. I also had looked at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00GWGLUZ0\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B00GWGLUZ0&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=nahumck-20&#038;linkId=DVCBVWTHP25HGPM6\">Microsoft Universal Mobile Keyboard<\/a> and thought that it would be nice. I did end up buying a 13&quot; laptop sleeve, which gives me the option to carry a stylus pen, a laser pointer, and a note pad with me to meetings at work and makes the folding aspect of the design moot for me; surprisingly, the sleeve makes a huge difference for me in that I have everything I need with me when I&#8217;m on the go.<\/li>\n<li>The batteries are 2 AAA batteries, not a built in rechargeable battery. I will have to see how battery life plays into things, and I&#8217;m not sure if this is really a negative thing; if I run out of power somewhere, I can always find a place to sell batteries, and won&#8217;t always be able to plug it into a wall.<\/li>\n<li>There are no keyboard keys to adjust the screen brightness. I would love to see this functionality be added in some way. It&#8217;s not a deal-breaker, but it would be a nice feature. Other keyboards made by Logitech do allow for a change in brightness, but they are 2x the price of this one; however, many competitive keyboards have this functionality.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is a real thumb-saver for me; prior to this, I have typed out everything written on my site with my thumbs, only from my iPhone. Now, I can use the device in a much different manner than before. Writing this way becomes <em>much<\/em> easier for me. I&#8217;ve found more ways to be productive using keyboard shortcuts (looking at you, <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes\/id905337691?at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">Drafts<\/a>) and tackled large <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/2do\/id303656546?at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">2Do<\/a> lists because it is far easier for me to enter information.<\/p>\n<h1>Jaybird X2 Sport Bluetooth Headphones<\/h1>\n<p>I picked up the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B013HSW4SM\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B013HSW4SM&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=nahumck-20&#038;linkId=HFKLUXOBXFIXVQX2\">Jaybird X2 Sport Wireless Bluetooth Headphones<\/a> in the middle of October. I didn&#8217;t write about them then, but when I was at home on vacation at the end of the year they really were a wonderful piece of kit.<\/p>\n<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts, and now that I don&#8217;t have to be tethered to my phone via a cable, it has been great to roam around. I have been able to leave my phone in the center of my house and travel virtually anywhere inside and still connect.<a href=\"#fn-1\" id=\"fnref-1\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The earbuds come with 3 sizes of tips in 2 styles (memory foam and silicone), as well as 3 sizes of fins for a custom fit to your ear. It took a little while to figure out which ones worked the best, but once I figured it out, they have been very comfortable to wear all day. I used to own the Bose in-ear buds, and they are just as comfortable to wear. I also went and purchased a variety pack of memory foam earbuds at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaybirdsport.com\/shop\/\">Jaybird&#8217;s website<\/a>; the comfort ear tips have been great for normal use. I also have enjoyed the isolation tips, which block out everything.<\/p>\n<p>Only negative is battery life, but with buds this small, I can understand. I can get anywhere from 8&#8211;10 hours of listening time, depending on the day; not sure I have any room to complain here, but if I could go 12&#8211;14 hours that would suit my needs much more on longer work days.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been on the fence about Bluetooth earbuds, these are definitely worth picking up. Amazon usually has sales on them, discounted to around $150 or so. They are more expensive than some, but I have yet to find a major issue with them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\nYour footage may vary&#8230; <a href=\"#fnref-1\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Logitech Bluetooth Keyboard A while ago, we got a Bluetooth keyboard for one of our tablets.
