When I got my <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/tactical-bag\/\">tactical bag<\/a>, I started to think of minimal carry. In fact, it&#8217;s starting to bleed into my regular life as well. But that&#8217;s a post for another time.<\/p>\n<p>At the start of the year, I started thinking of an all-USB-C charging setup. I&#8217;ve had other power bricks and cables, but as I move towards devices which can accept more from higher-output chargers, the idea of using USB-C only is really appealing. My iPad Pro 11&#8243; and iPhone Xs are both capable of faster charging speeds, which is really why I started my journey.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing for my regular travel setup. And by travel, I mean trips, back and forth to work, etc. Keep in mind that I (barely) use a PC for my day job, and I don&#8217;t carry a MacBook of any kind. This setup is really for my 4 devices: iPad Pro 11&#8243;, now with a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/37GYolO\">Cover Buddy case<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/32aG8jy\">Moshi iVisor AG screen protector<\/a>, and the Smart Keyboard Folio; iPhone Xs; Apple Watch Series 4; and <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/30uk2aR\">AirPods Pro<\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nahumck\/status\/1211460824533000193\">modified<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3ajFFiz\">foam tips<\/a> for extra comfort. I&#8217;m not always charging these devices at the same time. In fact, I&#8217;m normally charging my Apple Watch before bed, and my iPhone and iPad Pro overnight. At most, I would need 3 USB-C ports to charge. At the time of me writing this, there are zero options for a 3-port single charger, but it&#8217;s something I hope comes in the future.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1646\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1646\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1646\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/my-upgraded-charging-setup\/75f8ad2b-4bb6-4d51-b8ec-5b88a9727050\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?fit=1500%2C1500&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1500,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"AUKEY 63W\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;AUKEY 63W Wall Charger (credit: AUKEY)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?fit=450%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1646\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?resize=450%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?resize=450%2C450&amp;ssl=1 450w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/75F8AD2B-4BB6-4D51-B8EC-5B88A9727050.jpeg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">AUKEY 63W Wall Charger (credit: AUKEY)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The main source of power in my setup is the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2R46M9D\">AUKEY 63W PD wall charger with dual USB-C ports<\/a>. This is about the same size as my previous wall charger, but with a <em>lot<\/em> more power. The top port is an 18W PD port, and the bottom is a 60W PD port<sup id=\"fnref-1647-port\"><a href=\"#fn-1647-port\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> meant more for a MacBook than an iPad. But, thanks to the technology in the iPad Pro, it can accept the maximum charging and quickly power the device.<\/p>\n<p>For the cables, I have a single <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/30warjD\">6&#8242; Anker USB-C to USB-C cable<\/a> cable to power my iPad Pro and my <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2RreHNj\">AUKEY PD Power Bank 10000mAh<\/a>. There are no dual USB-C battery packs available right now that I can find; but when the technology is there, I&#8217;ll replace this with a 2-port USB-C battery pack with double the capacity; that way I can charge both the iPhone and iPad to 100%. For the AirPods Pro and my iPhones, I use the 1m USB-C to Lightning cable which came with the AirPods Pro, along with a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2TA8PnQ\">6&#8242; Anker USB-C to Lightning cable<\/a>. I travel with 2 iPhones, one for work and one for travel, and might need to charge both at any given time. And given that my day job requires road trips in vehicles for testing, I recently purchased a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/38rUspR\">Anker 2-Port USB-C Car Charger<\/a> to dual charge devices at 18W each; this has proven very useful on the road. I also carry my <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2G1f388\">HyperDrive USB-C Hub 6-in-1 Adapter<\/a><sup id=\"fnref-1647-removed\"><a href=\"#fn-1647-removed\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> along with a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Rxy9rD\">USB-A male to USB-C female adapter<\/a>, which does allow me to utilize either the HyperDrive&#8217;s USB-A port or a port in the car when I&#8217;m testing and want to use CarPlay.<sup id=\"fnref-1647-fornow\"><a href=\"#fn-1647-fornow\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>To facilitate the watch charging during travel, I was faced with a couple of options: keep the watch charger I have and bring another charing brick with me, buy a USB-C version of the watch charger, or try something new. I voted for the last option, and I picked up a <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/30sTIOk\">Satechi USB-C Apple Watch Charger<\/a>. This device plugs into my iPad Pro while I&#8217;m winding down for the day, pulling from the battery of the iPad itself. If I find that my iPad Pro is too low on power, I can simply plug this directly into the small <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2V0pIZy\">Aukey 18W USB-C wall charger<\/a> I carry; it&#8217;s a little bigger than a standard iPhone 5W charging brick, but delivers 18W of power over USB-C and has a folding plug. It is a small device, which is great for travel, but I will need to be mindful about where I might leave it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been enjoying this setup. It&#8217;s not quite the ideal setup that I&#8217;m looking to achieve \u2013\u00a0a future where I have a 3-port USB wall charger and a 2-port USB-C battery pack \u2013 but it&#8217;s what I have available now. With this setup, it&#8217;s compact and fairly light, and I have charging for all of my devices no matter what the scenario. As the future moves forward to USB-C for everything, I feel like I&#8217;m ready to embrace that future, and not much on my end will need to change. Being ahead of the game isn&#8217;t a bad thing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1647-port\">\nThe 60W charging is if nothing else is plugged in. If another device is plugged in, it&#8217;s 18W PD for the top port and 45W PD for the bottom port. In my specific use case, this is more than enough for what I need.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1647-port\">&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-1647-removed\">\nI did completely remove the two pieces that come with it so that it can sit flush with the Cover Buddy case installed.
