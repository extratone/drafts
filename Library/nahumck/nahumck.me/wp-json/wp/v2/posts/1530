It&#8217;s been my trusted bag for everything: work, travel, day tripping, etc. It carries everything I could think about needing and then some. But with some changes in my needs, I started realizing that for some situations \u2013\u00a0like going to my 3rd office that is known as Chipotle \u2013 it&#8217;s way more than I need. I need something smaller on the weekends when I&#8217;m not lugging my work laptop around.<sup id=\"fnref-1530-laptop\"><a href=\"#fn-1530-laptop\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>I needed something smaller, compact, focused. I needed a <em><strong>tactical<\/strong><\/em> bag.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<p>So in my quest, I started thinking about what I would need for a trip for personal life, excluding work from it completely. I started developing a list of what I would need at any given time while on the go, and I was intentionally thinking of what I really <em>needed<\/em> for a day run anywhere I was going. I had some other needs as well: I wanted it to be as small as possible, have some RFID shielding, and also provide some anti-theft options. I did a lot of searching, and even asked Seth \u2013\u00a0the man who has a bag for damn near anything \u2013\u00a0about what he uses for this purpose. He had recently picked up the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rei.com\/product\/110915\/pacsafe-vibe-325-crossbody-bag\">Pacsafe Vibe 325<\/a>. It looked like a great bag, but it was a bit more than I wanted to spend.<sup id=\"fnref-1530-rei\"><a href=\"#fn-1530-rei\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> But when I looked for that bag on Amazon, I found a few other bags that caught my eye.<\/p>\n<p>After a bit of sifting, I ended up finding the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01D3S0BE0\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Travelon Anti-Theft Urban Sling Bag<\/a>. While it doesn&#8217;t look tactical the way a GO RUCK bag does, this thing just screams urban tactical. Even though this is a small carry, it&#8217;s large enough for me to overpack it and get a lot inside of it. I ended up getting black, even though there is a gray option I might have liked more, because it blends seamlessly with the zippers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1529\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/tactical-bag\/processed-with-darkroom\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?fit=3024%2C4032&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"3024,4032\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone XS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Processed With Darkroom&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1547365560&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.25&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.058823529411765&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Processed With Darkroom&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Inside Pockets\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?fit=338%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?resize=338%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Inside Pockets\" width=\"338\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1529\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?resize=338%2C450&amp;ssl=1 338w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?resize=1200%2C1600&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/A5191761-B98E-4459-A069-2C3EA2BE4A2D.jpeg?w=2200&amp;ssl=1 2200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of anti-theft details of this bag: there are locking zippers to keep the compartments secure as you are moving around; the bag and straps have reinforced, anti-slash materials to keep the bag from being cut off my body; and the area for cards\/passports are RFID shielded.
