I might find something I really like, and use it until it breaks. And then I&#8217;ll go get the same thing to replace it. The exception is apps: I like trying things, even if I only end up back where I began. And when I find a great app, it usually makes me want to use it often.<\/p>\n<p>For a long time now, I&#8217;ve used <a title=\"Drafts on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes\/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Drafts<\/a> for all of my writing. I absolutely <strong>love<\/strong> Drafts: I&#8217;ve written about my love for it and the amazing things it can do <a title=\"nahumck.me - Drafts posts\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/tag\/drafts\/\">multiple times<\/a> over. I write and process posts through Drafts, using a combination of keys, actions, and <a title=\"Workflow on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/workflow-powerful-automation\/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Workflow<\/a> to get them published. If my dreams come true for the <a title=\"nahumck.me - Drafts 5.0: A Wish List\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/drafts-5-0-a-wish-list\/\">next big version of Drafts<\/a>, it will further cement it as the single app on iOS that I can&#8217;t live without.<\/p>\n<p>There are three main ways that I use Drafts on a regular basis (for writing):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>short snippets of text that I need to transform into something else in another app<\/li>\n<li>my daily <a title=\"nahumck.mr - Rolling Your Own\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/rolling-your-own\/\">journal<\/a> entries (typically short)<\/li>\n<li>my website (usually <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">too<\/span> long)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The first two are made easier with Drafts, due to the custom workflows I have set up to make them happen. But having a dedicated app to concentrate on my website, where I don&#8217;t get distracted \u2014 by notes, calendar entries and tasks that reside in Drafts before they are sent elsewhere \u2014 is extremely appealing to allow me to write in a more focused manner.<\/p>\n<p>So in the year of great writing apps, and my own interests with <a title=\"nahumck.me - Trials and Experiments\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/trials-and-experiments\">trials and experiments<\/a>, I began feeling like maybe I should sit down and really give some dedicated apps a shot. Am I using the right tool for the job? Are there things that I&#8217;m missing or could improve upon by not trying something different, something new?<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Byword<\/h3>\n<p>I first went back to <a title=\"Byword on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/byword\/id482063361?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Byword<\/a> to see if I could start with something simple. Byword has a great, simple interface and is a traditional Markdown editor. The direct publishing from within the app is pretty great. But for me, the experience is about the same as Drafts, and I don&#8217;t want to add an app into my workflow unless it&#8217;s going to make things better for me.<\/p>\n<h3>Editorial<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve used <a title=\"Editorial on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/editorial\/id673907758?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Editorial<\/a> quite a bit in the past. It&#8217;s a solid text editor that not only uses Markdown, but also TaskPaper and other formats; the editor itself is much like Byword, but with the addition of folding and arranging headers. It has a very powerful automation component, powered by Python, which can do some amazing things if you know what you&#8217;re doing. It integrates well with Dropbox, which is something that I like to have so that I can keep my files all in one place.<\/p>\n<p>But the development of the app has been stagnant. <a title=\"Pythonista on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/pythonista-3\/id1085978097?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Pythonista<\/a> is the app that makes the developer money, so justifying development time on an app that isn&#8217;t going to make you money is something that few app developers will ever do, let alone with great frequency. If an app isn&#8217;t moving forward and progressing, I can&#8217;t stick with it and be left behind.<\/p>\n<h3>Scrivener<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Scrivener on the Mac App Store \" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/scrivener\/id418889511?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Scrivener for macOS<\/a> has been around for a long time, and users of the app have wanted it to come to iOS for years. Now that it&#8217;s finally available for <a title=\"Scrivener on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/scrivener\/id972387337?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">iOS<\/a>, I wanted to see what the feature set was like.<\/p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t take me long to realize that while Scrivener looks to be an amazing app, it wasn&#8217;t going to work for me. I am spoiled by Markdown: composing anything in a <a title=\"Daring Fireball - Markdown\" href=\"http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/\">Markdown format<\/a> has become second nature to me. And while I&#8217;m willing to try new things, changing from that markup style isn&#8217;t one of them. That said, if you&#8217;re penning a lot of books, screenplays, etc., \u2014 it looks to be a solid app for you.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<h3>Ulysses<\/h3>\n<p>I had previously purchased <a title=\"Ulysses on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ulysses\/id950335311?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Ulysses for iOS<\/a> to do one thing: make an ePub for my post on <a title=\"nahumck.me - Move Your Thoughts to 2Do\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/move-your-thoughts-to-2do\">moving over to <\/a><a title=\"2Do on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/2do\/id303656546?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">2Do<\/a>. I was astonished at how well it worked, especially when it was all from my iPhone; I created an ePub in an hour. But aside from that, I had never really spent any amount of in-depth time making it my only long-form text editor.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very used to posting from Drafts via Workflow to my WordPress site. There are times that I will need to make changes to the formatting, so I had to make <a title=\"Workflow - Ulysses \u2192 Drafts\" href=\"https:\/\/workflow.is\/workflows\/b7d5805192534d809fb37d0a457e83ba\">a workflow<\/a> to send the text to Drafts.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> But I have yet to do that again in practice, thanks to how well the direct integration of publishing to WordPress has worked for me.<\/p>\n<p>The customization of the editor and the export formats is where Ulysses really does shine over other apps that I&#8217;ve used. The clarity it allows is simply amazing, and is something that I will hold other apps to when new ones inevitably come along. You can change fonts, colors, line spacing, etc. in the editor for a fully customizable experience to make the writing environment comfortable for <em>you<\/em>. The Markdown XL color syntax elements allow you see an element of your text as a formatted or special element, but do not really take away from reading like other traditional Markdown editors can.<\/p>\n<p>There are existing <a title=\"Ulysses Style Exchange - Themes\" href=\"http:\/\/styles.ulyssesapp.com\/tagged\/Theme\">Ulysses themes<\/a> and <a title=\"Ulysses Style Exchange\" href=\"http:\/\/styles.ulyssesapp.com\/\">other preset customizations<\/a> that you can choose from, but if you have the <a title=\"Ulysses on the Mac App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ulysses\/id623795237?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">Mac version<\/a>, you can create your own custom style. I spent some time with my MacBook <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Air<\/span> Water, and after a little time and tweaking I was able to make my own <a title=\"Drafts 5.0 Theme - Ulysses Style Exchange\" href=\"http:\/\/styles.ulyssesapp.com\/bundle\/Drafts+5.0\/57a1dbbb0d7f933124cbe659\">custom theme<\/a> based on my vision of a <a title=\"nahumck.me - Drafts 5.0: A Wish List\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/drafts-5-0-a-wish-list\/\">Drafts 5.0 color syntax<\/a>.<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> Additionally, I was pointed to a post which allowed me to get <a title=\"SF Mono Font\" href=\"http:\/\/jschaible.com\/sf-mono-font\/\">SF Mono<\/a> as a font choice. The combination of the two has lead to the most visually stunning writing experience I&#8217;ve ever had, and actually makes me want to <em>write<\/em>. I really would love to see the ability to create the theme and other customization options come over to iOS, even down to my <a title=\"nahumck.me - Making a Case for the iPhone Pro\" href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/making-a-case-for-the-iphone-pro\">iPad nano<\/a>, so that I don&#8217;t have to touch the Mac at all. Hopefully The Soulmen will add this functionality as it continues to gain feature parity between macOS and iOS.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Drafts-5.0-Theme.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And just when I didn&#8217;t think it could get better, <a title=\"Ulysses 2.6 Release Notes (PDF)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ulyssesapp.com\/press\/releases\/16-07-28-Ulysses-2.6-WordPress.pdf\">typewriter mode<\/a> showed up in the Ulysses beta. I previously had written off the idea of a typewriter mode in apps; I thought that by having a changing focal point within an app, it would make for a worse experience. But I can tell you now that I was so very, very wrong. Having this mode has been incredibly helpful, and allows me to write words more fluidly than I ever have before. I can focus on the sentence, line, or paragraph I&#8217;m trying to write, rather than being distracted by everything within the entire sheet.<\/p>\n<p>As I&#8217;m writing, I often have edits upon edits that I do; I write, rewrite and remove a lot. But now with Ulysses, I am able to use some of the extra markup styles not available in most text editors, and I can apply multiple markup styles to text in my posts. If I need to look something up, I can simply wrap the text with the &#8220;marked&#8221; syntax, denoted by <code>:: ::<\/code> . And later, if I decide that I don&#8217;t want to include a section, I can use the &#8220;delete&#8221; markup <code>|| ||<\/code> ; this is nice because I can keep everything in the text, but it won&#8217;t post that text upon export.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" style=\"width: 75%;\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Ulysses-Multiple-Markup.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another thing to love about Ulysses is the find\/replace feature. It&#8217;s more than just find and replace: think of it more like search and replace. The search (find) function of the app allows me to search to ensure that I&#8217;m not repeating too many instances of the same word. I have previously not had this option available to me on iOS, and I&#8217;m very grateful to have it to improve my posts going forward.<sup><a id=\"ffn4\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>I do miss some of the custom shortcuts and ways that I can use the Safari View Controller to search for links that I have set up in Drafts. There is a way in Ulysses to search with text by selecting a word, pressing &#8220;Define&#8221;, and then pressing &#8220;Search Web&#8221; in the bottom right corner; that will kick you to Safari and you can tap on the upper left corner to return to Ulysses. This is far from elegant or easily discoverable, and I&#8217;d like to see this improved, especially for users using smaller screens.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m starting to train my muscle memory to work better with Ulysses. For example, I had some difficulty getting the <a title=\"Ulysses Keyboard Shortcuts (PDF)\" href=\"http:\/\/media.the-soulmen.com\/ulyssesapp\/resources\/blog\/Ulysses%20for%20iOS%20Shortcuts.pdf\">external keyboard shortcut<\/a> keys down. To help with this, I actually went and changed my Drafts keyboard shortcuts to be the same (as much as possible) as Ulysses. I&#8217;m still learning, still making mistakes, but using the same shortcuts in two places has been helping immensely.<\/p>\n<p>And ultimately, it&#8217;s been helping me do the one thing it was designed to help me with: write. I&#8217;m able to take my ideas and converge on what my message is going to be. I&#8217;m able to discern between what is important and what is not. I can write in sections, splitting a post (like this one) into smaller, focused chunks, and accomplish more in less time.<\/p>\n<p>When I started this experiment, I only set out to try out another way, feeling like I&#8217;d end up back where I started. I thought I&#8217;d see how a dedicated app fares in my method and style of writing and determine that I was ok with what I had. But I wanted to give it a fair shot, before I completely discard it as something I don&#8217;t need, free from the sway of prominent bloggers and tech influencers telling me what I should be using.<\/p>\n<p>To my surprise and delight, I&#8217;m absolutely in love with Ulysses. It has transformed the way I&#8217;m approaching my writing. It&#8217;s not replacing my journal or quick notes, but it is serving as the focal point for my site; I have more clarity, more enthusiasm, more determination, and I think I&#8217;m producing better results. And an app that does that is nothing short of <em>fantastic<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Ulysses is <a title=\"Ulysses on the App Store\" href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ulysses\/id950335311?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumckme\">available on the App Store for $24.99<\/a>, and well worth every penny.<\/em><\/p>\n<ol id=\"footnotes\">\n<li id=\"fn1\">I&#8217;m really excited to see what lies in store for Federico Viticci&#8217;s review of iOS 10, which is going to be completely written in Scrivener.
