Then, I focused on how I get my information on a daily basis, which led me to the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/keep-it-simple\/\">Reminders and the Siri Watch Face<\/a>. I can use the Apple Watch as a tool to see what is coming next and focus my attention on my next action; I&#8217;ve even started using the Siri watch face in conjunction with my calendar, so that I can better map out my day.

I just don&#8217;t feel like moving around apps and finding something else to distract me from what I&#8217;m doing.
