We dive in on some of the new stuff from <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/drafts-26-the-customization-update\/\">version 26<\/a> which introduced custom themes and syntaxes. We also touch on a few other <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/misc\/changelog-ios.html\">updates<\/a> from the first version to now as well. I hope you enjoy it.<\/p>\n<p>There were a couple of things in the episode that I wanted to follow-up on here, including the homework assignment David gave me. I&#8217;m thrilled that the time spent with David and Rosemary gave me the idea, which made me reconsider some things with my personal journaling and changed how I&#8217;m doing it going forward.<br \/>\n<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3>Theme Switching with Workspaces<\/h3>\n<p>Ever since I&#8217;ve used workspaces + action groups to create what I called modules, I&#8217;ve used a script actions to switch between them. Originally, I set each workspace, action group, and keyboard row individually; once the action and keyboard group options were added to the workspace manager, I simplified the actions. I keep the single action in every one of my action groups which I use in the keyboard row to use on the iPhone for quick access to switch. Where I use this switching method a lot is on my iPad, using a hardware keyboard. All of my modules are brought up with keyboard shortcuts, assigned to <code>\u23182 - 9<\/code>; both <code>\u23181<\/code> and <code>\u23189<\/code> are reserved by Drafts for the draft and action list show\/hide, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>With the addition of themes, I&#8217;ve now modified the modules I have to include themes that I want to use in those different contexts. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll update this more over time. I primarily use dark mode, so that&#8217;s what I currently have in there. But you could also modify the scripts to include light themes as well. Here&#8217;s my <a href=\"https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/g\/1Jn\">Modules action group<\/a> as it stands today for you to play with and make your own. You&#8217;ll need to change the theme names in each of the module actions, else you might get an error.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t quite yet cracked the switching of syntaxes based on themes. I have, however, leveraged Matt Gemmell&#8217;s previous Switch Syntax action and <a href=\"https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1jz\">created my own<\/a> which provides a list of all the installed syntaxes. It&#8217;s not automated, but it does the job when I need it. I&#8217;m sure Rosemary is working on something even more clever\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Automated Journaling<\/h3>\n<p>On the show, we talked about some of the automations I&#8217;ve used (in most cases, continued to use) frequently. One of my journal shortcuts saves the text of the journal as a PDF for future reading. That&#8217;s when David brought up a great suggestion: using a Shortcuts automation at a specific time to automatically save the journal at night so I don&#8217;t have to do it manually.<\/p>\n<p>It took a few modifications to my original shortcut, but I have the automatic saving of journal entries figured out. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/4d686cd67ae440448d3e0469080db9d9\">Journal \u2022\u00a0Save<\/a> shortcut searches my Journal workspace for today&#8217;s journal entry, gets the content of the draft, creates an entry title (formatted <code>Journal Entry yyyy-MM-dd<\/code>), creates a nicely-formatted PDF, and saves the PDF version to <code>\/iCloud Drive\/Shortcuts\/Journal\/<\/code>.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-bug\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-bug\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> I manually move these once a week during my weekly review for now, until the Shortcuts team actually gives me that built in feature.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-tried\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-tried\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup> This action can be used with Shortcuts automation; if you choose to run the automation without asking, it will run automatically in the background. I have mine set to run at 11:00 pm every day, and in my testing since we recorded, it&#8217;s been working fantastically.<\/p>\n<p>This then lead me to <strong><em>change<\/em><\/strong> the way I&#8217;ve been journaling, so that I can just automate the creation of the journal entry and never miss a day. The old way of starting my journal is answering a couple of questions: did I wear my watch to sleep to get data out of <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch\/id1164801111?uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">AutoSleep<\/a> \u2013\u00a0a feature that is broken due to an iOS 14.5 bug \u00a0\u2013 and how did I feel when I woke up. Here&#8217;s a secret: I&#8217;m not sure I sleep all that well generally, I never use the quantifiable data in any meaningful way, and I don&#8217;t know that I need a reminder of how shitty all that can be and make me feel. If I want a pretty chart or other meaningful insights, I&#8217;d be better off going into AutoSleep or the Health app to get it. Weighing the importance of sleep tracking vs daily journaling, having a journal entry for every day that is just automatically there just makes more sense. Using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/0e033f7bbf0f465da352e8b0268c17a4\">Journal \u2022\u00a0Start<\/a> shortcut in conjunction with another Shortcuts automation which runs at 6:00am, and automatically starts a journal entry for me without any interaction on my part.<sup id=\"fnref-2049-forecast\"><a href=\"#fn-2049-forecast\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been running this for the week, and it&#8217;s been really great so far. Removing the friction of interacting every time I want to start and save a journal entry has made me want to journal more. Sometimes, it&#8217;s those little things that get you change your mind. I&#8217;m calling this a win.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Thanks again David and Rosemary for having me on, and for the idea to be a better Automator!<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-2049-first\">\nYou can find my first appearance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.relay.fm\/automators\/23\">here<\/a>.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-2049-first\">&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-2049-bug\">\nI am having a shortcuts bug where the file from Shortcuts gets created with a <code>-2<\/code> suffix, which is hyper annoying.
