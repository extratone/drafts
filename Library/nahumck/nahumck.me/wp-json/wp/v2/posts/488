A 7.8 pound laptop. I used a messenger bag for years<a id=\"fnref-1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn-1\">[1]<\/a>, but it had started getting very uncomfortable for my walk in and out of the office. So I started searching for a bag that would not only be good for carrying my laptop, but also would be good for travel, biking (if I only had time to do it), hiking, and anything else I threw at it.<\/p>\n<p>After several recommendations, looking at $200\u2013300 bags, I finally looked into a recommendation from a colleague of mine: the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ospreypacks.com\/us\/en\/product\/momentum-30-MOMENTUM30.html\">Osprey Momentum 30<\/a>. As the name implies, there\u2019s 30L of storage in this thing. It\u2019s big enough to hold my work laptop (at nearly one inch thick), a 13&#8243; MacBook Pro in a sleeve, my lunch tote, a water bottle, and a ton of gear. I\u2019ve only been using it for a short while, but it works perfectly for what I need.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t wait to use it more outdoors and while biking, assuming the weather improves. But even if it\u2019s raining, the backpack comes with a rain cover that is stowed on the bottom of the bag to keep your pack and belongings dry. I picked mine up at REI with a 20% member discount, but it is also available on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00AVSETRQ\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Amazon<\/a> and other places.<a id=\"fnref-2\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn-2\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>PCalc<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m very, very late to this party. <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/pcalc-the-best-calculator\/id284666222?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">PCalc<\/a> has been around a long time. It\u2019s not just the best calculator: it has conversions, formulas, a plethora of options, and \u2014 my favorite \u2014 customizable layouts.<\/p>\n<p>The option to customize layouts is amazing. You can start with a given layout, but you can also rearrange the buttons as you need; you can also add your own buttons to include frequently used conversions, constants, or functions. This can also extend to the <code>2nd<\/code> function, and you can have 2 buttons occupy the same space. I\u2019ve just started playing around with it, and I\u2019m already coming up with a default layout that is all my own.<\/p>\n<figure><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/PCalc-Setup.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>I\u2019ve had this app for a day.
