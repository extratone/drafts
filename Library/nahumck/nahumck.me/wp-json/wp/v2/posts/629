Like Blink, this is an app for individuals who use affiliate\/associate links on their websites. But instead of using iTunes, Associate is an app for those that use the <a href=\"https:\/\/affiliate-program.amazon.com\" title=\"Amazon Affiliate Link Program\">Amazon Affiliate Link Program<\/a>.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Image-5-16-16-1-08-PM.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" title=\"Associate vs Blink Search\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Much like it&#39;s iTunes counterpart, you simply search for an item within Amazon that you want to share, and you can generate and\/or share the link right from the app. Associate doesn&#39;t have everything from Blink yet (like a URL scheme), but this is a solid 1.0 release.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> I would really love to see the same preview layout that Blink has for the detail view, so that I can visually see what I&#39;m linking to; the current way makes it so that I can&#39;t tell by just the link. With time, there will be improvement, and I&#39;m really looking forward to the updates in the future.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Image-5-16-16-1-08-PM-1.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" title=\"Associate vs Blink Detail\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>Associate and Blink are the best way to get your affiliate links, period. If you link to anything iTunes or Amazon, these will pay for themselves over time. I cannot recommend them highly enough.<\/p>\n<p><em>Update: Associate by itself is $5, but for those that are new or already purchased Blink, there is a <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app-bundle\/affiliate-linking-pack\/id1114857700?mt=8&amp;at=1001l4VZ&amp;ct=nahumck_me\">bundle deal<\/a> that ends up making it $8, or $3 if you already own Blink. Both apps together for $8 is a no-brainer for those that use these affiliate programs.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Anker Ergonomic Mouse<\/h2>\n<p>I sit at a computer every day of the week, except for maybe the weekends. Using a mouse on a daily basis has some issues over time, and when I found myself in need of a mouse last week, I wanted to get something ergonomic to prevent any <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Repetitive_strain_injury\" title=\"Repetitive Strain Injury\">RSI<\/a> from happening.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Image-5-16-16-1-07-PM.jpeg?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" title=\"Anker Ergonomic Wireless 2.4GHz USB Mouse\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/figure>\n<p>After some searching on Amazon, I found the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B018LR04B8\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Anker Ergonomic USB Mouse\">Anker Ergonomic USB Mouse<\/a>. The mouse has a nice soft-touch feel, and is really comfortable in the hand. The &quot;vertical&quot; setup makes it so your forearm isn&#39;t turning, and keeps your arm &amp; hand in line. It doesn&#39;t have as many buttons as some other mice out there, but with what I use it for at work, having the regular right\/left buttons, a scroll wheel, and two side buttons for forward\/back for navigation are perfect.<\/p>\n<p>One setting in particular that I like is the sensitivity button that allows you to control the speed of the mouse movement on the fly. When I&#39;m working in a CAD model, it&#39;s nice to slow down the movement when I need to zoom in on a feature.<\/p>\n<p>It only took me about a day of use to get really comfortable with it. I&#39;ve had zero issues with it, and I&#39;m really happy to have found it.<\/p>\n<h2>Apple Leather Case<\/h2>\n<p>I&#39;ve always used a case on my iPhone.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> I&#39;ve tried some cheap TPU cases, some Speck cases, and even Lifeproof cases \u2014 but I&#39;ve never really found them to be a good fit.<\/p>\n<p>When I got my iPhone 6s Plus, I opted for a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0159SZS6I\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Apple Silicone Case - Charcoal Gray\">silicone case in charcoal gray<\/a>. But with time, there were a lot of wear marks that made it visually unappealing. So I returned the case and got the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01DGDN284\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Apple Leather Case - Storm Gray\">Apple Leather Case<\/a> instead (also available for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01DGDN3SS\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Apple Leather Case - Storm Gray\">iPhone 6s<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The leather case is slippery at first, but now that it has had time to wear in, it&#39;s perfect for what I need. It is showing signs of wear, but unlike the silicone case, this case is looking better with age. The Genius at the Apple Store had a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0158JQSYO\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Apple Leather Case - Saddle Brown\">saddle brown<\/a> one that looked awesome due to the wear marks he had. I&#39;m starting to see similar results in mine, and I love it.<\/p>\n<ol id=\"footnotes\">\n<li id=\"fn1\">I&#39;ve asked the developer, and the URL scheme will be coming in an update. <a href=\"#ffn1\">&#8617;<\/a><\/li>\n<li id=\"fn2\">Except when my last iPhone 5c case broke, and I ran that device naked until my upgrade.
