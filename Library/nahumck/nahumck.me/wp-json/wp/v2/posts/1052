And the list could go on. But you get the point.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that I love to do but don&#39;t really have the time to do is read. And with the complexity of my life not letting up, I need to get a better handle on life. Part of doing so is removing some of the distraction that I have, and that starts on my personal device.<br \/>\n<!--more--><br \/>\nI&#39;m going to be making a few changes until I get my house in order, so-to-speak. First, I&#39;m going to remove all of the Twitter apps from my phone. Then, I&#39;m going to set up email alerts for mentions and DMs. I&#39;ll still be active in the various <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/slack-business-communication-for-teams\/id618783545?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\" title=\"Slack\">Slack<\/a> channels, where I have a lot of fantastic conversation without the politics, hate crimes, and other bullshit that can be seen.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> If I want to see horrible things in life, I&#39;ll look at Google or Apple News.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#39;t in retaliation to anything about Twitter nor the people on it: it&#39;s still a decent platform for social engagement if you do it correctly. I&#39;ll still be using it for the podcast when we announce new episodes, and anything I post will also automatically get posted.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#39;m attempting to do is minimize my distractions, focus on what I need to get done, and get back on top of my life, and hopefully be more productive.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> This will be one less thing I idly read, which can be devoted to other, <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/book\/getting-things-done\/id888011802?mt=11&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\" title=\"Getting Things Done\">more important texts<\/a>. I&#39;m hoping this will spark some creative thoughts along the way, and some introspection that will lead to some good <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/rolling-your-own\/\" title=\"Rolling Your Own - nahumck.me\">journaling<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;m also wanting this to kickstart my time for other aspects of life. I&#39;m going to devote time to healthy eating, living, fitness, and relaxation in the form of meditation and yoga. I might use some apps along the way to help me, which would be a far better use of my time than thumbing through a feed.
