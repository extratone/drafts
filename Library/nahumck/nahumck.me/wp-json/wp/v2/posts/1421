It&#8217;s been a while. The summer time is normally hard for most people, with big events, family vacations, and the extra daylight to spend all your time outside.<\/p>\n<p>Except this summer hasn&#8217;t been that for me. It&#8217;s probably the busiest, craziest summer I&#8217;ve ever had (at least that I can recall). It&#8217;s been full of ups and downs, and non-stop action every day. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I had some true down time.<\/p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s been going on? Well, there&#8217;s been a lot of personal stuff \u2013\u00a0too personal to get into on a public site. I&#8217;ve extensively journaled about it, which has been great. Personal life has influenced the vacations I took this summer &#8211; a grand total of zero. Kids have been active this summer, there&#8217;s a ton to do around the house, and things slip through the cracks. It happens. I&#8217;m originally from east of Cleveland, so I know what it means to have it not be your year.<\/p>\n<p>Work has been hellacious, but in a multitude of great ways. It&#8217;s been busy with so much going on, but I&#8217;m managing more than ever. There&#8217;s a shift in the perception of who I am and what I can bring, which has been fantastic. I&#8217;ve even switch to a single task manager rather than having two. Even though I enjoyed the <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/bifurcation\/\">bifurcation<\/a>, this has been better for me this summer with everything going on. For now \u2013\u00a0and you know it is always subject to change \u2013\u00a0I&#8217;ve settled on <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id572688855?at=1001l4VZ\">Todoist<\/a>. A huge reason why is the addition of the Todoist script objects in <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id1236254471?at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts<\/a> and the speed at which I can enter everything in. But more on that at a different time.<\/p>\n<p>I have spent the summer doing a few things to take care of me. For too many years, I let certain things go. But in the spring, I came to the realization that I put off me too much, and I needed to reclaim some of it. So I&#8217;ve been working out regularly \u2013 three to five times a week. I&#8217;m making sure to complete those goals not for the gamification, but because I know the end result will be a healthier me. I&#8217;m going to bed at a reasonable time, and waking up at 5am every morning to get this done, but it&#8217;s been better.<\/p>\n<p>All this to say: all of this has made it so that I haven&#8217;t been writing as much. I had planned on writing more on some aspects of Drafts after I wrote <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/drafts-5-the-macstories-review\/\">the review<\/a>. I still have those plans. And I will do them. Life often just finds a way to get the way of some personal life stuff. But I don&#8217;t regret the decisions I&#8217;ve made in reclaiming some &#8220;me&#8221; time. I&#8217;m working on a better balance, and a better me. A short hiatus every once in a while is a wonderful thing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why hello there.
