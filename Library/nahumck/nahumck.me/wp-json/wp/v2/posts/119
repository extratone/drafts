And last weekend, I did just that, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nahumck.me\/2015\/06\/27\/fresh-coat-of-paint\">updated my blog<\/a>. I had wanted to try a few things, so I started looking around and asking others questions about how to do things.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s when I realized that I spent last weekend wasting my time and this wasn\u2019t going to work the way I wanted it to. Lesson learned. Time for plan B.<\/p>\n<p>The previous version of this site was on WP.com. And while it\u2019s good for most people, I really wanted to tweak a few key things to have it fit the personality of my writing. I wanted the formatting of the site to come from my voice, as if you could hear me writing it.<\/p>\n<p>In my daily conversations, I have small asides that are relevant<a href=\"#fn-1\" id=\"fnref-1\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[1]<\/a> and add to the conversation. They don\u2019t take away from the conversation when talking<a href=\"#fn-2\" id=\"fnref-2\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[2]<\/a>, but that is hard to convey in written form. Using footnotes is a great way of doing them, but for how I <em>speak<\/em>, they generally aren\u2019t good for my own use.<\/p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"bigfootjs.com\">Bigfoot<\/a>. No, not the mysterious creature pictured in hundreds of blurry images around the world<a href=\"#fn-3\" id=\"fnref-3\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[3]<\/a>, but the popular footnote format used most famously in <a href=\"https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/instapaper\/id288545208?at=1001l4VZ&#038;ct=nahumck_me\">Instapaper<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what I wanted to use to convey how I speak. And that is simply not available on WP.com; I checked with a Happiness Engineer (seriously, this is what they are called) and he confirmed that was indeed the case. So it looked like I was giving up on that convention on my site.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been told a number of times that if I\u2019m going to write, I need to write for myself and write in my own voice. I need to have that as part of of my style with my blog. Sure, I could get by with the footnotes, or changing my writing style. But that wouldn\u2019t be me. That wouldn\u2019t be my voice. That wouldn\u2019t make me happy.<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s when it hit me: I wasted my time last weekend setting this up all wrong. Is a WP.com site easier to manage? Yes. But does it do\/look\/feel like what I want? No.<\/p>\n<p>So after some research \u2014 and admittedly not enough of it \u2014 I decided to try to a self-hosted install of WordPress. The install was smooth,and installing the necessary plugins was a breeze. I chose a new theme and published.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to stick to this for a bit until I started reading up on installing the footnotes I want. Reading code is like reading another language for me.<a href=\"#fn-4\" id=\"fnref-4\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[4]<\/a> I couldn\u2019t find a helpful post to save my life: everything was verbose in the language of CSS, PHP, JS, jQuery, etc. But thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/wp-bigfoot\/\">this plugin<\/a>, it was a breeze.<a href=\"#fn-5\" id=\"fnref-5\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[5]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And so now that the site has been revamped again, I\u2019ve learned my lesson. Hopefully now I can settle into the rhythm of writing.<\/p>\n<p>The upkeep of the site will be different, and there\u2019s sure to be a learning curve<a href=\"#fn-6\" id=\"fnref-6\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[6]<\/a>, but at the end of the day, this is what is good for <em>me<\/em>. And while you don\u2019t have to live with me on a daily basis, it\u2019s going to be better for all of us going forward.<a href=\"#fn-7\" id=\"fnref-7\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">[7]<\/a> This writing style is better suited to sharing my voice, and makes me feel just a bit more human.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\nDebatable <a href=\"#fnref-1\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\nOh look, a bird!!! <a href=\"#fnref-2\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\nSeriously, why the hell are they <em>always<\/em> blurry? <a href=\"#fnref-3\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\nAnd I suck at English enough. <a href=\"#fnref-4\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#160;&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-5\">\nDo you know how long it took me to find this?
