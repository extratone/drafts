I had a Fitbit before, and it was all about step count. But now that I have a Watch, it&#39;s much more about being up and active. With watchOS 3, Activity Sharing was added: this allows users of the Apple Watch to view not only their fitness data, but their trusted friends as well. Within my <strike>ring<\/strike> circle of friends, it&#39;s been nice to motivate each other into doing a little more, even when we aren&#39;t talking. I can see that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mrbeefy\/\" title=\"Sam Davies on Twitter\">Sam<\/a> just rode his bike, I can tell that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffmueller\/\" title=\"Jeff Mueller on Twitter\">Jeff<\/a> has hit the treadmill &#8211; and I can feel like I&#39;m not doing enough and get after it.<\/p>\n<p>We also get to send responses when someone hits an achievement, which we have made more fun by using the standard responses of the watch. I can be encouraging, or I can be sarcastic. I&#39;m not seeing the results I want to see in my health just as yet, but I know I will be soon. And I&#39;m happy that my friends will also get to encourage me along the way and share in the fun.<\/p>\n<h2>Watch Bands<\/h2>\n<p>One surprising bit for me has been the customization. I&#39;m really enjoying the swapping of bands, the changing of watch faces,<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> and the unique way I can match all of this to the outfit or activity I am doing at the time. And while I&#39;m not going to get all crazy and buy every band out there, having some options has been really great.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, I have a couple of third-party bands that I really like. Aside from the black sport band that came with it, I also have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01LX9ZIEK\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Concrete Sport Band on Amazon\">concrete-colored band<\/a> that is the same. Well, <em>nearly<\/em> the same. Apple&#39;s material feels better, is likely better made, and will likely last longer over time; however, for $8-10 per band, I can get five of the 3rd-party bands for the price of one Apple band. When the Nike Apple Watch was announced, I liked the look of the new band; the fluoroelastomer bands can retain heat\/sweat, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01MCVMC2W\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Black\/Grey Nike Band on Amazon\">Nike band<\/a> seems to be better at reducing the amount. I also got a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01HQ00IY4\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Black Woven Nylon Band on Amazon\">nylon band<\/a> that is extremely similar to Apple&#39;s version, but for less than a third of the price. I wanted to get something fancy, but thanks to trade with a friend of mine, I now have a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B016JWO0HQ\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Milanese Loop Band on Amazon\">Milanese loop<\/a> that has quickly become my favorite band. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d like it as much as I have, but it&#39;s really, really great.<\/p>\n<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get more bands, and I&#39;ll likely have to get help for the amount that I ultimately get. But I&#39;m trying to keep it limited, trying to keep it fun and interesting, and have something that&#39;s personal to me. I&#39;m digging it.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: when ordering bands, especially on Amazon, make sure you are ordering the correct size for your watch. The links above are for the 42mm M\/L size bands, where applicable.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Anker Power Charger<\/h2>\n<p>I had purchased one of these for my wife a while ago, as she was charging multiple devices by her side of the bed. I had just been using the power bricks that came with my devices. But right after getting the Apple Watch, I needed to change this. It had become cumbersome. So, I ordered the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00VH8ZW02\/?tag=nahumck-20\" title=\"Anker 40W\/8A 5-Port USB Charger PowerPort 5 on Amazon\">Anker 40W\/8A 5-Port USB Charger PowerPort 5<\/a> for my own use.
