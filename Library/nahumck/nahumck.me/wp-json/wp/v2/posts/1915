I worry about the bugs, the data loss, and all the ways it can screw with my devices. Then, inevitably, I end up jumping on them around beta 2 or 3. When the releases come out in the fall, I usually delete the beta profile and do an install with the release version. I follow the recommended steps for backing up, then just install the OS and carry on.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve done a clean install: no restoration from a backup, installing everything as new, letting the cloud services work to bring the data back to my devices on a per-app basis. This is a time-consuming process, and the main reason I haven&#8217;t done it in so long. It might be all the way back to iOS 8 since I&#8217;ve done this. Those many, many years of little inconsistencies have lead to a lot of cruft, and I think this is the year to do wipe the slate clean.<\/p>\n<p>Playing around with the iOS 14 beta so far, the App Library is a feature that hasn&#8217;t been my favorite. It doesn&#8217;t organize the apps in the categories which I would: I think that a banking app should be in finance, not in productivity. I think games should be a category, which include the Apple Arcade titles as well. I get they are pushing a brand, but unless you stay subscribed, that advertising will go away. The search aspect of it is great, but I can also use Spotlight search to find the apps I need.<\/p>\n<p>But where it doesn&#8217;t live up to my desires, it does deliver on supporting a clean install. I don&#8217;t have to organize my Home Screen as I add apps one by one. I can hide pages and pages of apps, and organize my true Home Screen. This takes away a <em>ton<\/em> of pressure and mental overhead that I don&#8217;t need to carry with me. It will make the process far easier for me than ever before. And in that way, the App Library is actually a welcome feature for me now. I wish that same feature would be there on the iPad, but perhaps there are more plans for that in the future.<\/p>\n<p>This year is the perfect time to do a clean install. I can finally shed the years of issues without having to worry about the time and effort required to get back up and running. I&#8217;m all for clearing clutter and minimizing what things I have in my life. And this fall will be no different.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every year, I hesitate on jumping on the betas.
