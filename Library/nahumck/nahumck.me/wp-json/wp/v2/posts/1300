First, it wast the GI flu, then it was whatever I have now. And both times, I was basically down and out most of the day. I absolutely detest getting sick, and I&#8217;m admittedly useless when I get sick. Thankfully, my wife has been able to take care of things for the most part. I just pray that she or my kids (who likely gave this to me) don&#8217;t catch it.<\/p>\n<p>So in these times of being sick, I&#8217;m faced with a dilemma: how on earth do I complete my move goal? At the time of this writing, I&#8217;ve completed my move goal 296 times in a row \u2013 but it comes with a caveat. My wife will tell me that I&#8217;m cheating, but really, I blame Apple for what I&#8217;m doing. How am I &#8220;cheating&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p><em>I lower my move goal<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>I blame Apple because they really need to provide ways for people who are sick to have some rest days. How am I supposed to complete my normal 550 move goal when I have a 102\u00baF fever? There should be a way to change the Activity rings to a &#8220;sick&#8221; mode, where it lowers all three rings to a reasonable amount. While I&#8217;m at it: there should be a rest day, at least one day a week, that I can not complete my rings and the move goal streak can continue. <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/activity\/id1089666978?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Activity++<\/a> does this, and I like that the streak just continues even if you&#8217;ve taken a day off.<\/p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m done being sick, I&#8217;ll change my move goal back to what it was and complete it regularly. But if I get sick again, I&#8217;ll likely lower it to reduce my stress and keep the streak alive. Sure, I could let my streak lapse and start over. But unless you&#8217;re a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kylesethgray\/\">superhuman<\/a>, it&#8217;s difficult when life gets in your way and things slip a day. I&#8217;m all for the gamification of things like activity, but I&#8217;m also going to game the system if there isn&#8217;t a reasonable way to let me take care of myself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been battling a couple of different illnesses.
