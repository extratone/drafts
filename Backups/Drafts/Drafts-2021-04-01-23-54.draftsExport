    "content" : "# Philip Roth, _American Pastoral_, Page 35 \nYou fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick; you come at them unmenacingly on your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpillar treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the brain of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them, while you're  anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with  them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperceptiono And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people, which gets bled of the significance we think  it has and takes on instead a significance that is ludicrous, so illequipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to go off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that these word  people are closer to the real thing than the real people that we mangle with our ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you can do that—well, lucky you.",

She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocore Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Dilluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the [*New York Times*-appointed champion](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/02\/23\/movies\/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html) of Columbia Missouri’s [20-Year-Long](https:\/\/www.komu.com\/news\/mega-church-growth\/) *Quirk the Church!* Soverignty Crusade: *The Crossing*. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s *actually* a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.\n\nSince 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of [Nancy Walton](https:\/\/www.insidephilanthropy.com\/dance\/2013\/7\/31\/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html)’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 - mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway - and includes a powered pump-arrigated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and *hassle-free* as possible.\n\nGod’s ~white~ children become *especially* sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceieved deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simulataneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in *The Crossing*’s stellar member retinenance record - the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive \/ General Order Number One as [abridged by Christ himself](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV) to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample *The Crossing*’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of [the church’s Yelp! page](https:\/\/yelp.to\/qTKq\/U3zCk0HlEY) would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is [the singular 4\/5 star entry](https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare).)\n\nI do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of said exceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. \n\n`Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences\/engagement with *The Crossing* has been with their digital content from a relative distance.`\n\n![](IMG_9310.JPEG)\n![](IMG_9311.JPG)\n\n![The Crossing’s Pastors](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/E5RLm4y.jpeg)\n![Apple Leadership Headshots](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/B8TX5h0.jpeg)\n\nThe ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https:\/\/youtu.be\/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/dave-cover\/), [Keith Simon](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/keith-simon\/), and [Shay Roush](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/shay-roush\/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/leadership\/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium\/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the default theme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the *exact* same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.\n\n**I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS**\n![](FullSizeRender.jpg)\n![The Crossing on WordPress](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/s1Qh8Rz.jpg)\n\nNay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: *The Business* of the faith is very much a *volume* business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “[ecosystem](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ericjackson\/2014\/06\/03\/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company\/)” ceased to be an [exhaustive buzzword](‪https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?hl=en-US&tz=300&date=today+5-y&q=apple+ecosystem&sni=3‬) in tech media discourse, perhaps because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple **scale**. My recollection of high school biology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “[very lovely swamp](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2014\/09\/apple-ecosystem\/)” exceptionally said. \n\n``` html\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\" data-theme=\"light\" data-link-color=\"#00006b\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/POLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#POLL<\/a>:<br>If the Second Coming were to occur today, which handset would Jesus Christ buy?<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/tech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tech<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/smartphones?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#smartphones<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/faith?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#faith<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/john316?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#john316<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/MAGA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MAGA<\/a><\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/825951279910440960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 30, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n```\n\nThe church [live streams](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/livestream\/) every fucking ~~keynote~~ sermon in HD on *Vimeo*, not *YouTube*.

I have been rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute monopoly yielding *gargantuan* levels of essentially passive income from a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers — the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would’ve needed to be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful position over every other class — and leaves their egocentric minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions: *what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to them? What if it is our* **divine responsibility** *as superior beings to take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep — for they cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?*\n\nYou see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity’s ancient advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it’s rumored to’ve been selling user data *to* the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?\n\nOf course, it’s admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this godfearing place in the most perverse *look what I saw first that you didn’t see because you’re just not as bright but lucky for you, I’m so fucking generous with my wisdom* sort of thinking around which the entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built upon, but this is my *one* thing, okay? I’ve been waiting years for the right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and — thanks to this year’s public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who’ve been silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people’s trust in Google had a godawful week.\n\n## Don’t Be Evil\n\nOn Monday, [*Gizmodo*](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300)[ reported](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300) that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in protest of their work assisting the Department of Defense to “implement machine learning to classify images gathered by drones” for the detail fleeting Project Maven, despite some [4000 employee signatures](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/04\/technology\/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html) on a [letter](http:\/\/extratone.com\/library\/dearsundar.pdf) addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he “cancel this project immediately,” and “draft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology,” citing the infamous “Don’t Be Evil” motto, which Google [**then proceeded to remove**](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393) from its [code of conduct](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180504211806\/https:\/\/abc.xyz\/investor\/other\/google-code-of-conduct.html) for the first time in 18 years **the day after** the *New York Times* article went to press, on April 5th.\n\nOn initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our thoughts arrives an easy narrative of a Silicon Valley mutiny comprised of twelve brave, conscientious souls who’ve been eaten up inside by their complicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study — kept awake for months by the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in a bombed-out street.\n\n*Ah ha*, we say. *That man is no good, and he just wouldn’t listen! They knew they didn’t have a choice… They only did what they had to do…*\n\nThe reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be even more theatrical. The sheer volume of correspondence must surely be beyond anything capable of the enduser’s imagination, so let’s phone a friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence is an [old blog post](http:\/\/bentilly.blogspot.com\/2010\/01\/things-ive-learned-at-google.html) by [Benjamin Tilly](https:\/\/twitter.com\/btilly) on his first month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediately to describe in great detail how best to “deal with a lot of email in gmail” at peak efficiency using shortcuts and labels.\n“As you get email, you need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus what is context specific.”\n\nNow we have a bit better idea of the *aggressive emailing* that was a sure constant on a normal workday at Google in 2010, so it must’ve been deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without making much headway because the leadership’s response was apparently “complicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providing open-source software to Project Maven,” this new knowledge having *significant* effect on our mind’s image of Sundar Pichai’s activities in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell in order to install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and we recall that Google’s Googleplex headquarters resembles nowhere in modern life more than a brand new playground built in a design language borrowing heavily from *Spy Kids*. And though these Twelve disciples are unnamed for the moment, a few of them could immediately land book deals by going public, and every single one would always have by default not only the badge of “I landed a job at Google,” (which is really to say *I have hit Life’s maximum level cap*,) but “I worked at Google for a while, but ended up quitting to do something else,” which is guaranteed to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present in *whatever* crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool [Sarah Cooper](https:\/\/twitter.com\/sarahcpr) quit Google to become a comedian and even [got to talk to Kara Swisher](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2018\/1\/10\/16871786\/sarah-cooper-comedian-google-dick-costolo-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast)!\nI won’t pretend to understand big tech’s diminutive bastardization of prestige, but “more than 90 academics” jumping to publish an [open letter](https:\/\/www.icrac.net\/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers\/) (adjacent to a huge *DONATE: Support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots* button) in which they “write in solidarity with the 3100+ Google employees” who’s terrible boss decided to help some lackeys in the Pentagon set up their email and didn’t text back for a whole hour doesn’t sound 100% sincere. Notably, I don’t know how *or why* the fuck 90 people would go about collaborating on a single document, but if it really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs…\nAt one point, it was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing garage ghouls and dorm dorks who gave *cooky*, *wacko* names to their dot com startups in parody and defiance of the lame-ass surname anagrams on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who’ve stuck around have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses me off every day how worried I am that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like Yahoo! and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as *that bipedal race who remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in way less than a single generation, they all just went* **FUCKING INSANE** *and blew themselves up because they suddenly hated all sense.*\n\n“Google” is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and\/or anger in your last moments as it sounds in American English like you’ve startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately by an esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous, and in real English English, it almost always sounds like a parent speaking of a character on a pre-K children’s television programme whom they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from expressing so otherwise because they know that *Teletubbies* shit is the most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It’s fascinating how exclusive the word “Google” is to American English because in everything else it really *is* complete nonsense, but lets halt all etymological discussions right now because we’ve only now just finished with Monday.\n\n![Bad Chrome](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZcS94oK.png)\n\n## The Soul Ledger\n\nOn Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and [soul-detaching screenshots](https:\/\/twitter.com\/FickleCrux\/status\/914767928456749056) were usurped when a thoroughly alarming internal company video called [*The Selfish Ledger*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/5\/17\/17344250\/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy) was leaked to *The Verge,* which I watched once then and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but I will. Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about editorializing — when tech journalism desperately needs some confident, informed opinion more than ever — Vlad Savov’s accompanying article should be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror where he perhaps could not.\nThe production style is technically identical to that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque, motion-graphics-paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which you find playing at max volume on your mom’s iPad from where she’s fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string soundtrack multiplies one’s discomfort as such that we would all end up in the fetal position without remembering the transition were it not for the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who’s face I thankfully associate heavily enough with [his infamous ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/richarddawkins\/status\/389432783304548352)[*down-and-out*](https:\/\/twitter.com\/richarddawkins\/status\/389432783304548352)[ Tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/richarddawkins\/status\/389432783304548352) to be a welcome respite in attention before the very scary hypothesis for which it’s been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad:\n\n> The system would be able to “plug gaps in its knowledge and refine its model of human behavior” — not just your particular behavior or mine, but that of the entire human species. “By thinking of user data as multigenerational,” explains Foster, “it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the preceding generation’s behaviors and decisions.” Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior for patterns, “sequencing” it like the human genome, and making “increasingly accurate predictions about decisions and future behaviors.”\n\nThe next time the *what if they do something scary* question comes up in a casual conversation about Google, you’ll have something a lot more substantial than just speculation. Or will you? *The Verge* reached out for comment and got an awfully convenient response.\n\n> This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as ‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate.\n\nWow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for just about any suggestion or behavior, though it does seem almost *deliberately* uncomfortable, doesn’t it? No matter — whether or not this video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or simply to *explore uncomfortable ideas* because it is proof that the company has reached that critical Vatican stage — if you’ll remember — where they now feel comfortable *exploring* Very Bad, but Very easily made Real Ideas amongst themselves about what would happen if they allowed their system to *nudge its users* around a different, slightly less optimal route to the bar, let’s say — without their knowledge — in order for the system to collect traffic data for the sake of its own interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest of all Ledger users now and in the future, so why not?\n\n> The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not only tracks our behavior, but offers direction towards a desired result.”\n\nThis, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the *real issue* with data collection — its power over huge groups by way of their behavior and it is *never* going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers or VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even decades from now. EndUser does not understand — or, crucially, *have any desire* to understand anything technical about what leads to the PewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here’s a great opportunity to escape Silicon Valley’s technolibertarianism and resign your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective action: if you want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google Government, more worryingly,) you should invest your time, effort, and knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and regulating Big Tech.\n\n## Google Government\n\nThe internet as it stands is made possible by Google as *the* goto resource for online advertising. In 2016, “Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads,” [according to ](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/3\/14\/14890122\/google-search-ad-market-share-growth)[*Recode*](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/3\/14\/14890122\/google-search-ad-market-share-growth). By 2019, “that’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market.” Google’s edge in user behavior and targeted advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers to integrate independent platforms with Google’s software services at various levels makes it very difficult for any advertising-funded individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the Google universe. YouTube — a Google property since 2006 — has actively invested in and supported a new career path entirely within their own platform that is rapidly becoming [popularly aspired-to by young children](https:\/\/metro.co.uk\/2018\/01\/19\/children-now-more-likely-to-want-to-become-youtubers-than-actors-7241396\/), while the reality of existence as a full-time YouTuber is [far less glamorous](https:\/\/medium.com\/@robertoblake\/what-nobody-tells-you-about-being-a-youtuber-the-youtube-middle-class-378b77eb8bc9) than the immediately-visible surface would indicate, and the effort already expended by my generation in its pursuit has already [made us insane](http:\/\/bit.ly\/searchchildren).\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-link-color=\"#00006b\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">thanks google. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/1jRtrD77R3\">pic.twitter.com\/1jRtrD77R3<\/a><\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/914767928456749056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nSo, what would the internet look like if Google didn’t exist? We know they’ve been working with the government now on various projects, but what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenly warranted an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we know from [a post on Quora](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes) by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the sudden absence of Google for “2–3 mins” set the internet into a bit of a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we’ve all grown exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies (including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices running connection-dependent operating systems. It’s not much of a stretch to argue that Google’s sudden disappearance would constitute a Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.\n\nThough the tangible results of advertising have been quantified significantly in the past 20 years, one can’t help but wonder after watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising understand where their money is going, but they know that if they *don’t* advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it’s yielded Google so much fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as evidenced by [their investments in life extension](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/science-and-health\/2017\/4\/27\/15409672\/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research) — so that, perhaps, they will have more time on Earth to figure it out.\n\nWhen you build a collection of the world’s smartest people in a [self-sufficient environment](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/business\/currency\/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work) that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In fact, with its [vast collection of abandoned products and properties](https:\/\/www.computerworlduk.com\/galleries\/it-vendors\/google-graveyard-3508070\/), Google must surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on recent software releases along with its [recent entries into the hardware space](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/10\/4\/16405184\/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal), Google is also one of the worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and Google Search — its core, original function — has been [out of control](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/1430\/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem) for years, and all of them are designed blandly and excruciatingly tiring to look at.\n\n## Google Shun\n\nIf this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate Google from your own online life as much as possible, there *are* alternatives in almost every one of the sphere’s they dominate. As of late, [DuckDuckGo](https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/about) has accumulated a fair amount of [buzz and coverage](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global\/2018\/may\/19\/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo) as a private, more relevant alternative to Google’s plain old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first result for “extratone,” I’ve found it simply insufficient as a replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what I’m looking for. By contrast, [Dropbox Paper](http:\/\/dropbox.com\/paper) is such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own review very shortly.) For getting around, know that [MapQuest](https:\/\/www.mapquest.com) is not only [still around](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/economy\/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does\/2015\/05\/22\/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html) — it’s now a very competitive mobile navigation app.\n\nI, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information and behavior as possible because I believe “privacy” is a completely futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often use alternatives to Google services simply because I *fucking hate* the way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you’ll be forced to seek out less dignified sources like [*Lifehacker*](https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/5876794\/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web) and [Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/antigoogle\/) and decide if the additional time you’ll spend using most of them to accomplish the same tasks is really worth your digital angst.\n\nIf Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to do but accept the future they intend to create because they’ve long been too powerful to control. In the meantime, I’d suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry may be doing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.\n\n#spectacle"

    "content" : "## Askeptical spectacle in the day-to-day typhoon of Faith’s modern enterprise. \n\nThe year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14 through which my mother was still comfortable enforcing my obligation to attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocre Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Diluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the [*New York Times*-appointed champion](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/02\/23\/movies\/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html) of Columbia Missouri’s [20-Year-Long](https:\/\/www.komu.com\/news\/mega-church-growth\/) *Quirk the Church!* Sovereignty Crusade: *The Crossing*. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s *actually* a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.\n\nSince 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of [Nancy Walton](https:\/\/www.insidephilanthropy.com\/dance\/2013\/7\/31\/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html)’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 - mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway - and includes a powered pump-arrigated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and *hassle-free* as possible.\n\nGod’s ~white~ children become *especially* sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in *The Crossing*’s stellar member retention record - the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive \/ General Order Number One as [abridged by Christ himself](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV) to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample *The Crossing*’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of [the church’s Yelp! page](https:\/\/yelp.to\/qTKq\/U3zCk0HlEY) would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is [the singular 4\/5 star entry](https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare).)\n\nI do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of said exceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. \n\n(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences\/engagement with *The Crossing* has been with their digital content from a relative distance.)\n\n![The Crossing’s Pastors](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/E5RLm4y.jpeg)\n![Apple Leadership Headshots](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/B8TX5h0.jpeg)\n\nThe ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https:\/\/youtu.be\/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/dave-cover\/), [Keith Simon](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/keith-simon\/), and [Shay Roush](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/shay-roush\/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/leadership\/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium\/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the default theme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all.

She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocre Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Diluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the [*New York Times*-appointed champion](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/02\/23\/movies\/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html) of Columbia Missouri’s [20-Year-Long](https:\/\/www.komu.com\/news\/mega-church-growth\/) *Quirk the Church!* Sovereignty Crusade: *The Crossing*. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s *actually* a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.\n\nSince 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of [Nancy Walton](https:\/\/www.insidephilanthropy.com\/dance\/2013\/7\/31\/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html)’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 - mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway - and includes a powered pump-arrigated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and *hassle-free* as possible.\n\nGod’s ~white~ children become *especially* sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in *The Crossing*’s stellar member retention record - the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive \/ General Order Number One as [abridged by Christ himself](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV) to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample *The Crossing*’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of [the church’s Yelp! page](https:\/\/yelp.to\/qTKq\/U3zCk0HlEY) would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is [the singular 4\/5 star entry](https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare).)\n\nI do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of said exceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. \n\n(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences\/engagement with *The Crossing* has been with their digital content from a relative distance.)\n\n![The Crossing’s Pastors](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/E5RLm4y.jpeg)\n![Apple Leadership Headshots](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/B8TX5h0.jpeg)\n\nThe ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https:\/\/youtu.be\/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/dave-cover\/), [Keith Simon](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/keith-simon\/), and [Shay Roush](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/shay-roush\/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/leadership\/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium\/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the default theme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the *exact* same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.\n\n**I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS**\n\n![The Crossing on WordPress](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/s1Qh8Rz.jpg)\n\nNay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: *The Business* of the faith is very much a *volume* business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision.

I’m starting to suspect that Apple must surely have some sort of good practice standard which such a feature would violate because even [my own quick-disable shortcut](https:\/\/shortcutsgallery.com\/shortcuts\/turn-off-bluetooth-wifi\/) has inexplicably ceased functioning in the past 6 months. :(\n\n![](iOS%2013%20Public%20Beta%20Notes\/sharesheetdark.png)\n\n### Notes\nThough I was just defending skeuomorphism, I have somehow managed to hate everything about the way iOS’ native Notes app has looked since the very beginning.\n\n### Safari\nI’m sad to say, is still far from the most effective browser available on iOS - I decided to swap it back in to slot #1 on my doc, replacing [Firefox](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/firefox-private-safe-browser\/id989804926) for the duration of this experience. \nIn keeping with that comparison: [Firefox 12 for iOS](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2018\/06\/12\/firefox-12-ios-file-downloads-easier-syncing\/) introduced a Downloads manager & folder, “unified link management,” and iCloud sync in February of last year, which left the native Safari at perhaps its lowest point of regard on iPhone. For most of us UX obsessives, it has only been launched in the time since by hyperlinks from the few good apps remaining which still do not offer a default preference to Chrome and\/or Firefox. One would imagine, then, that the iOS Safari team has been under substantial internal pressure to deliver a miraculous rework\/featureset bent on conquering the hearts of app critics and powerusers once again. Unfortunately, the version I’ve been subjecting myself to  in iOS 13 Beta smells an awful lot like defeatism.\n\n- [ ] Tab switching is still the smoothest-animated, but remains by far the slowest and most crashy of all the mainstream mobile browsers.\n\n- [ ] Unfortunately, it’s quite pitiful when Apple *invents* features months\/years after the *alternative* crowd mastered them *on the fringe* with zero disadvantages. There *are* some genuinely-clever additions like **saving open tabs as bookmarks**, and informed folks like *[Gadget Hacks](https:\/\/ios.gadgethacks.com\/news\/20-features-ios-13s-safari-you-wont-want-miss-0198425\/)* who’ve described it as “formidable,” yet many of their citations invoke token Apple jokes. *Thank you so much, your majesties, for giving us this new gift of your genius... The Start Page*.\n\n- [ ] The one ever-improving advantage of using native Safari which I think we can all agree on aligns with Apple’s new - and actually quite admirable - **privacy and security-founded brand identity**. (\n\n- [ ] > A new downloads folder gives you a central place to access your web downloads and attachments from Safari and Mail.\n### Siri\n- [ ] Siri is my favorite voice assistant because she’s by far the biggest idiot of the bunch, yet I’ve found her to *actually* add real functionality to my experience. \n## Keyboard Shortcuts \n- [ ] The new “Quickpath” swiping keyboard makes zero sense as a feature add at this point, but okay Craig.\n- [ ] Fucking **VALIDATED** by the attention to keyboard shortcuts (most of the big-deal PadOS’ new shortcuts seem to have been tossed in the iPhone too. God Bless.) Very nice of Craig Apple... I am the only iPhone user in history who has (and continues to) ever made use of this feature more than once. (I didn’t have a laptop in Community College so I just fooled around in Evernote, hunched over my little iPhone 4S to reach the fucking thing.)\n*Specifically* though... I can’t find any direct mention of it in Apple’s current preview documentation, but Command-Space shows\/hides **Spotlight**, which is the only way to switch between apps without the touchscreen (I can’t seem to find a definite answer on whether or not Command-Tab ever functionally switch applications on iPhone, but I think I would remember it.) This function has always been just clunky enough to interrupt a good workflow.\nFor instance, let’s say I needed to switch from this very document in Bear to YouTube in order to grab a hyperlink to a [quick demo capture](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Yt5lPqn2i6M). Here’s what my keystrokes would look like:\n`Command Space y o u tab enter`\n<a href='IMG_9033.MP4'>IMG_9033.MP4<\/a>\n- [ ]  The various performance updates might seem like a bonus to some, but those of us who’ve been paying attention (out of need or curiosity) to the *absolutely absurd* size of regular app updates to date find the rework of software packages in iOS 13  (claimed 50% smaller App Store packages and 60% smaller updates) to be nothing more than a monstrously-late address to conclude *years* of gross negligence. (Remember we’re talking about the world’s richest company, here... There is no excuse for anything but perfection.)\n\n## Files\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/tratomedia\n\n## Text\n![](iOS%2013%20Public%20Beta%20Notes\/FullSizeRender.jpg)\n![Apple Bets on Rich Text](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/COuYE0d.jpeg)\n- [ ] Amazing. Revolutionary. Unfortunately, I am not quite dilligent enough to count how many times Rich Text was mentioned in the ~2.5 hour [WWDC 2019 keynote](https:\/\/youtu.be\/UThGcWBIMpU) \n- [ ] [iOS 13: You can soon install, manage and download custom fonts for your iPhone](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/ios-13-ipados-iphone-install-download-manage-custom-fonts-from-app-store-settings\/) | *CNET* \n\n## General UI\n- [ ] Admittedly, it did not occur to me just how stale iOS’ audio\/ringer volume indicator had become until I first hit a hardware button while running 13 and marveled at the newfound consideration of use exhibited by Apple’s placement of the new element where it belonged 12 years ago. \n> Apple is making it a lot easier to delete apps in iOS 13.

I usually suggest practicing force-touching apps directly on the homescreen to prompt the quick function\/share menu without fear of inordinate consequences\n\n- [ ] I could be losing my mind, but I’m almost positive an twisting animation has been added when switching apps\/returning to the homescreen.\n\n[What's new in iOS 13 developer beta 4?](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2019\/07\/17\/whats-new-in-ios-13-developer-beta-4\/)  | *9to5Mac* [[What's new in iOS 13 developer beta 4?]]\n\n\n#software",

I have done my best to address this truth with brevity in preface to [everything I've written about iOS so far](https:\/\/extratone.com\/tag:ios) in hopes that I can contribute substantially to related discourse from a unique perspective. (At this point, it would probably be more reasonable if I just created a static disclaimer\/explainer document, but standardization remains the *last possible thing* technology writing needs m[ore]() of.) If you've arrived seeking a more contemporarily-arranged article about iOS 13, you might consider [my unedited notes for this piece](http:\/\/bit.ly\/13beta) to be a sort of haphazard bibliography. (I'd also love to read your comments there on Dropbox Paper.)Part of this tradition since [WWDC 2013’s introduction of iOS 7](https:\/\/youtu.be\/gmn4ve4oTL8), naturally, is the dissemination of the Keynote presentations themselves. As embedded as I’ve been, it’s always been with a hearty amount of genuine discomfort with the cultish zeal glimpsed on the reflective faces of the \n\n![](XIII%20My%20Very%20Own%20iOS%20Release\/IMG_9208.PNG)\n![WWDC 2019 Dream Intro](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/lgZ4pVg.png)\n\n\n> I’ve never been an “Apple is doomed without Steve Jobs” person. But part of what made Apple the Apple we know in the post-1997 era is that when Jobs was at the helm, all design decisions were going through someone with great taste. Not perfect taste, but great taste. But the other part of what made Jobs such a great leader is that he could recognize bad decisions, sooner rather than later, and get them fixed.  \n> “[Jony Ive Is Leaving Apple](https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2019\/06\/jony_ive_leaves_apple)” - *Daring Fireball*  \nFuc\n![](XIII%20My%20Very%20Own%20iOS%20Release\/IMG_9064.PNG)\n\nthe marque  perceived  the marque and I began to feel   been jaded certain to be with  to be with Apple’s priorities  iOS announcements.\n[Jony Ive's Departure Marks End of Apple's Design Cult - Bloomberg](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2019-06-28\/jony-ive-s-departure-marks-end-of-apple-s-design-cult)\n\n* I would love to believe iOS13 (along with a few other recent catalysts) represents dawn after an *excruciatingly* long technological night for David Blue\n#software",

I needed something that wasn&apos;t heavy, something portable, and something versatile. Over time, some of those needs have changed, and I&apos;ve added a few more use cases that might not be best satisfied by the SKF. So when the Brydge Pro keyboards were announced, I was intrigued about the possibility of that option. I reached out to the team at Brydge, who were kind enough to send me an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07MTSF94C\/?tag=nahumck-20\">11&quot; Brydge Pro keyboard<\/a> review unit to try out.<\/p>\n<p>The unboxing experience is very akin to Apple: everything has a purpose, it&apos;s very clean, and well considered. In the box, you get the keyboard, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the back panel. I like the inclusion of the back panel for most situations. While I do like this for when I&apos;m carrying it around in a bag, I found that it didn&apos;t always fit as well as I would have liked; there might be an improvement in the tolerancing of the part that could help. I also found that a few times, I would slide the Brydge towards me on a table, and the back panel would catch on the bottom edge and want to come off. When you use it in tablet mode – the mode where you can write on it with the pencil – it does prevent it from folding fully flat; you&apos;ll have to set it off to the side to use it in that way. There&apos;s just no room for the back panel in that device sandwich. It just feels odd to throw that to the side when you want to use it in this way.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1628\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1628\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/brydge-pro-keyboard\/47d65602-be6b-4dc9-9234-460e096678e8\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?fit=4465%2C2512&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"4465,2512\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1547316865&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"brydge-pro-keyboard-11-tablet-mode\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?fit=450%2C253&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?fit=840%2C473&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=450%2C253&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1628\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=450%2C253&amp;ssl=1 450w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?w=1680&amp;ssl=1 1680w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/47D65602-BE6B-4DC9-9234-460E096678E8.jpeg?w=2520&amp;ssl=1 2520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 85vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1628\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brydge Pro in tablet mode<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>The keyboard itself is a Bluetooth keyboard, and utilizes a USB-C cable to charge. You can even charge the keyboard from your iPad Pro if you&apos;re running out of power. Out of the box, the keyboard had about 78% power, which was great to get me started. It took about 5 days for the battery to run down to where I wanted to charge it again, likely due to the backlit keys. I have found that if you&apos;re doing a lot of typing with the keyboard lit, you&apos;re going to drain it a lot faster.<\/p>\n<p>Having the battery in the keyboard means it was going to be heavy compared to the SKF, which brings me to the first thing I immediately noticed about the Brydge Pro keyboard: this thing is <em>heavy<\/em>. Not just a little, but a lot. At 700 grams for the keyboard and the protective cover, it more than doubles the weight of the iPad Pro<sup id=\"fnref-1622-weight\"><a href=\"#fn-1622-weight\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> carry in my bag; compare that to the SKF, which clocks in at just 302 grams, and it&apos;s clear to see that you need to be very comfortable with the extra weight if you&apos;re going to carry this around. It may not seem like a lot, but it&apos;s significant. The extra weight is great for when you&apos;re using it in your lap, however, like when you&apos;re on a couch or as I did in a car while on a road trip; the SKF tends to be more top-heavy,<sup id=\"fnref-1622-heavy\"><a href=\"#fn-1622-heavy\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup> and doesn&apos;t feel as stable in those instances whereas the Brydge felt solid.<\/p>\n<p>The next thing I noticed: the keyboard is a bit narrower than the SKF. Being that this is the 11&quot; model, that width can take some getting used to. But I was able to adapt over the first several days. The placement of the Siri key is also a bit difficult with the layout, as my finger often presses is when I&apos;m attempting to use the control key. Again, this layout just takes some getting use to and is not insurmountable; I&apos;m even trying to utilize Siri more now with this key, using the Type to Siri accessibility feature, and the availability of such a key is welcome. Having the media keys above the row is great. I really wish that Apple would figure out how to make this happen. I&apos;ve suggested a couple of different ways before, but I doubt they&apos;d ever consider it.<sup id=\"fnref-1622-idea\"><a href=\"#fn-1622-idea\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>My review unit did have a couple of issues: I noticed that the lettering on the keys weren&apos;t straight. I notice these sorts of things all the time as part of my day job, so it was immediately apparent to me. It&apos;s not a deal breaker by any means, and my hope is that it is because this is an early review unit. The main issue that I did have with the keyboard has been the missed keystrokes. It&apos;s not all the time, but when it does happen, it takes me out of my writing focus. I reached out to the team at Brydge to let them know, and not only did they quickly respond acknowledging my concern while assuring me that this is not normal and they wanted to inspect the unit to see what was going on, but they also shipped me a new one the day after. Issues can happen in products from time to time, and even though this appears to be an isolated incident, the quick customer service experience and the fact that Brydge stand by their products is fantastic. The second unit I used did not have this issue, and most of my missed keystrokes were due to the more narrow keyboard or my lack of force to activate the key travel.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, I really like the Brydge Pro keyboard. The keys feel very good, the infinite angles and better lap capability are very versatile, and it really does make this combination of Brydge keyboard and iPad Pro feel like a traditional laptop. But I also couldn&apos;t help but notice that this might not be the best keyboard for me for the way I do work. In my day job, I&apos;m often moving between typing and notetaking with the Apple Pencil, and the Brydge is more cumbersome for that particular way of working. I can lay it fully flat, but that doesn&apos;t work as well sitting on my lap.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of my time with the review unit, I came away mixed: it&apos;s not as flexible for my style of working, but it&apos;s a really fantastic option for the iPad Pro. I&apos;m likely keeping my iPad Pro for a few more years, so having this option in addition to the Smart Keyboard Folio and the Smart Folio (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07H88J5GS\/?tag=nahumck-20\">knockoff<\/a>) is the trifecta, and something I&apos;m excited to add to my kit portfolio. I might, however, wait a bit before I buy this: with iPadOS 13 and the addition of an accessibility feature which provides cursor support, I can&apos;t help but think that Brydge might be working on a trackpad edition, similar to the version they have for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B077GJ92LX\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Surface Pro<\/a>. If this existed, I wouldn&apos;t have to carry an extra piece of kit in my bag. If they added that feature, it would push me over the edge for sure. But if you&apos;re in the market for a laptop-like keyboard, I cannot recommend this one enough.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-first\">\nI actually bought the Smart Folio (SF) before this, but immediately returned it after 30 min because I realized that my use cases needed the SKF.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1622-first\">&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-weight\">\nthe iPad Pro weighs 470g, for reference&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1622-weight\">&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-heavy\">\nThere&apos;s that word again, heavy.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1622-heavy\">&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-1622-idea\">\nMy idea: turn the &quot;globe&quot; key in the bottom left of the keyboard with a &quot;FN&quot; key.

Again, this is <em>a<\/em> way to solve it, and certainly not the way I envision Apple would do it.

I&apos;ve often loathed this word, but as things have become more and more busy for me at work along with everything that I&apos;ve endured with my personal life, I need it now more than ever.<\/p>\n<p>I have a ton of things to catch up on while I&apos;m off: some appointments, my house, hopefully a movie, and some much needed writing time as well. But this also means doing something that I&apos;m learning to live with: <strong><em>letting go<\/em><\/strong>. I&apos;m in a weird space with work: I&apos;m acting like a boss, but I&apos;m not quite official in the title.<sup id=\"fnref-1615-promotion\"><a href=\"#fn-1615-promotion\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> It&apos;s a trial run. And for the most part, I feel like I&apos;ve been doing a great job in handling it. When it comes to taking some time for me and letting that stuff be handled by others, I&apos;ve noticed that it&apos;s difficult for me.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&apos;t officially managed others before, but I&apos;m getting the opportunity to manage my peers and others through my role. It&apos;s been a unique experience to visibly see the transition from someone who &apos;does&apos; to someone who &apos;manages&apos;. And being honest: that transition is much harder than I thought it would be. It&apos;s a learning curve of ones self to let it go and get done, instead of doing.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, I&apos;ve set some lofty goals and personal standards for myself. These aren&apos;t always shared in the same way by the people I work with. There are some ways I conduct myself that others might not.<sup id=\"fnref-1615-better\"><a href=\"#fn-1615-better\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> And it&apos;s hard to sometimes rely on others to complete assignments to your own personal standards. Hopefully I&apos;ve laid out expectations and imparted what little wisdom I can to empower my supporting team to get everything completed while I&apos;m away.<\/p>\n<p>But there are times that you still have to be a &apos;doer&apos;. You <em>do<\/em> have to let go, and trust that it&apos;s going to get done. The work will still be there when I get back. The building will still be around. The job will still need to be done. But I&apos;m hoping that I can entrust some of my work to others and have them pick up the torch while I&apos;m taking some time for me. I&apos;m hopeful that come Monday, I&apos;ll be able to realize that this is ok and that I don&apos;t have as much to worry about as I think I do.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1615-promotion\">\nI really do hope that a promotion is coming.

I&apos;ve been listening for years, but I never started my own. But by the time that <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/fundamentally-broken\/\">Seth and I did<\/a>, there was an emerging idea started by Jason Snell: <a href=\"https:\/\/sixcolors.com\/post\/2016\/12\/recording-a-podcast-locally-on-ios-without-a-mac\/\">recording<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sixcolors.com\/post\/2015\/11\/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite\/\">editing<\/a> podcasts iOS-only. As someone who rarely ever touches a Mac for their day-to-day work, this idea has continued to gnaw at my brain. I tried my hand a couple of times at doing something differently with it, but it never panned out the way I wanted.<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to head down this road, I ended up switching microphones last year: I had the clutch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00N1YPXW2\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Blue Yeti<\/a> microphone, but decided on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B004QJOZS4\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB<\/a> instead. Not only was it better for the environment in which I record, but it also afforded me the possibility to record using both the USB and XLR connections, pushing me closer to the goal of iOS-only.<\/p>\n<p>A month or so ago, I was recording the show via the late-2012 Mac mini I have. I ended up having an issue while recording, and I lost my audio in several spots. Given that this is one of two jobs that I ever ask it to do, I was understandably upset and put off by recording in the same way going forward. The idea of going iOS-only came back to the forefront of my mind. I again turned to <a href=\"https:\/\/sixcolors.com\/post\/2019\/02\/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro\/\">Jason&apos;s setup<\/a>, only to realize that this was going to cost me several hundred dollars to create. I don&apos;t have that lying around, and I wanted to find something that would work for me.<\/p>\n<p>I can already record iOS-only: I can use my iPhone with AirPods to make the call and use my iPad Pro to record the local audio. This is how I recorded my end when I guested on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.relay.fm\/automators\/23\">Episode 23 of the Automators podcast<\/a>. I enjoyed doing this, but I also don&apos;t have a great way of having the good audio from my mic broadcast to the other hosts. I like the idea of using the iOS devices I have to record: I&apos;m always going to have them with me, so it just makes more sense to use them for the complete audio setup. I can use either device to record or make the call, I just need a way to get the sound of the mic to both of them. So that&apos;s where my search started. I had most of what I needed, I just needed an XLR interface of some type. Rather than search &apos;USB XLR interface&apos; like I had done multiple times before, I ended up just searching for &apos;XLR interface&apos;.<\/p>\n<p>That&apos;s when I ended up finding something new and unique: the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01LS9JI22\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Røde i-XLR<\/a>. This device was made for reporters, plugging into an XLR microphone and allowing mobile recording of interviews; when I saw it, I thought it might work perfectly for podcasting as well. Rather than take my XLR connection through an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sounddevices.com\/product\/usbpre-2\/\">expensive USB interface<\/a> into an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01DPOXS8I\/?tag=nahumck-20\">XLR recorder<\/a> of some type or another adaptor to my iPhone, this allows me to use my XLR connection and plug it directly into the iPhone without all the extra cables and steps. There&apos;s even an app – the <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/r%C3%B8de-reporter\/id1066635435?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Røde Recorder<\/a> – which was specifically made for this microphone. The idea was intriguing, so I decided to purchase it and test it out.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1598\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1598\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1598\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/the-ios-only-podcasting-kit\/ios-only-podcasting-schematic\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?fit=2388%2C1668&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2388,1668\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iOS-Only Podcasting Schematic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?fit=450%2C314&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?fit=840%2C587&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?resize=450%2C314&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"314\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1598\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?resize=450%2C314&amp;ssl=1 450w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?resize=768%2C536&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?resize=1024%2C715&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?resize=1200%2C838&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iOS-Only-Podcasting-Schematic.jpeg?w=1680&amp;ssl=1 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 85vw, 450px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1598\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The schematic. Don’t judge my drawing skills.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Here&apos;s how my setup is all connected, using my iPad Pro 2018 and my iPhone Xs.<sup id=\"fnref-1590-links\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-links\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup> First, I start with the power: I recommend using this Anker <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0721DV7YX\/?tag=nahumck-20\">wall-charger<\/a>, which provides a Power Delivery USB-C port along with a USB-A quick charge. I use it all the time for travel, and it&apos;s perfect for what I need. I use a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01LNA0XCU\/?tag=nahumck-20\">USB-C to USB-C<\/a> to power the iPad. Next, I connect the USB microphone cable to the iPad Pro using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07K6YFW7X\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Satechi hub<\/a>;<sup id=\"fnref-1590-hub\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-hub\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> this also allows me to use the HDMI for an external monitor and the USB-C port to power everything. Then, I connect the Røde iXLR to the end of the cable which comes with the microphone, and plug that into my iPhone directly. Finally, I connect the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B003LPTAYI\/?tag=nahumck-20\">over-the-ear headphones<\/a> to the the Røde iXLR and do a test recording to dial in the sound level for the environment. When I have that part set and I&apos;m happy with the audio, I&apos;ll connect the monitors directly to the back of the microphone so I can use them for the audio call; I can monitor the sound visually using Røde Reporter or <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/ferrite-recording-studio\/id1018780185?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Ferrite<\/a>. I prefer using Ferrite due to the smaller file sizes and better recording controls for volume as well as the ability to bookmark the audio when topic change and\/or I cough; it helps me in the edit later. However, I have noticed that using the configuration menu in Røde Reporter allows me to use a -20 dB pad for the mic, resulting in quieter background noise and an overall better sound.<\/p>\n<p>I did run into one small technical issue when getting this all set up: when the i-XLR is connected to the iPhone, the cellular radio creates an interference with the audio. To avoid this in the audio track, I have to turn on airplane mode,<sup id=\"fnref-1590-Seth\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-Seth\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup> then turn on the WiFi and then record. It&apos;s a simple issue, and one that I&apos;m not too concerned about: I can still get calls or messages if something is urgent.

The only bit that I don&apos;t have is the recording of the call itself, which isn&apos;t a big deal to me as long as the people I&apos;m recording with know what they are doing. This setup allows me to use my iOS devices which have shown to be more dependable than my Mac mini. I find my new setup option to be better for the actual running of the show: I can have my iPad Pro in split screen to handle show notes in <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts-capture-act\/id1236254471?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1001l4VZ\">Drafts<\/a>, Safari to do any real-time look-up, and the call in slide over on Skype; if I&apos;m using FaceTime, I can simply just jump back to the call if I want by tapping the green indicator in the upper left of the screen.<\/p>\n<p>This setup works surprisingly well. The audio quality is completely fine for anyone who&apos;s not a die-hard purist with bottomless pockets. I&apos;ve been testing a lot with it and can&apos;t notice a difference in what I&apos;ve been producing in the past. I&apos;m trying to do this for as little as possible. For someone who has an iPad and an iPhone, you can have a complete setup – for both home and travel – for around $400 all-in, including all of the chargers, cables, usb hub, interface, and microphone.<sup id=\"fnref-1590-total\"><a href=\"#fn-1590-total\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">7<\/a><\/sup> It&apos;s even less if you already have chargers or a USB hub. You can even expand the setup over time, making it the most versatile setup out there.<\/p>\n<p>I think this is the best part of the mobile setup I&apos;ve created: I don&apos;t need to have more wires and boxes costing me hundreds of dollars more. I will always have my iPhone and iPad with me, so this just makes more sense. It also helps make my setup portable, making my <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/perfectly-mobile\/\">mobile setup<\/a> that much better. So while I impatiently wait for WWDC to bring changes to the way I can podcast using only my iPad, I have found the best possible work-around for my uses. I&apos;ll share how I edit on iOS in my next post.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Here are the items you need to create the mobile kit with your iPad Pro (2018) and iPhone:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B06XXFQB8M\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Caseling hard case<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B004QJOZS4\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Microphone<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01LS9JI22\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Røde i-XLR<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0798JB6S3\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Neewer In-Ear Monitors<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00UUBS0SS\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Cable Matters USB C to Mini USB Cable (3.3 ft)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07K6YFW7X\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Satechi hub<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0721DV7YX\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Anker 49.5W USB C PD + USB A Wall Charger<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01LNA0XCU\/?tag=nahumck-20\">Anker PowerLine+ C to C 2.0 cable (6ft)<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1590-links\">\nLinks to everything will be below.

I might have even missed a quick affair with OmniFocus as well. But I digress.<\/p>\n<p>GoodTask has been my long-time favorite Reminders client. From the <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/goodtask-3-an-unexpected-surprise\/\">surprise<\/a> the first time I started really using it to now, it has made improvement after improvement in both functionality and appearance settings (love me those themes) on all platforms – iOS, macOS, and the Apple Watch. I was inclined to go back to GoodTask when the Apple Watch app was updated, so I moved everything over there in the beta. I had mentioned to the developer that there were a couple features which I was missing from Things, but I was very happy with the improvements to the apps. Those suggestions plus others were carefully considered, because they are now in the version 4.5 update of the app.<\/p>\n<h1>Tag Sorting<\/h1>\n<p>GoodTask 4.5 brings with it the ability to sort a List or Smart List based on tags. Tags are a clever implementation in GoodTask, which puts a <code>#tag<\/code> into the note of a reminder. GoodTask can parse this as a tag, and allow you to use that information within the note as a tag, much like the other information the developer uses to implement sub tasks. You can use all of your tags or specific tags per list, which is great for customizing how you view your different lists.<\/p>\n<p>With the new tag options, I&#8217;m able to now recreate some of the features that Things provided which gives me a better view of my tasks in different views. It all stems from the ability to sort lists and smart lists using Tags first, then due dates, etc.<\/p>\n<p>I absolutely love the headings feature of Things. When I have a specific project, having the breakout of different subsections is better for my brain. And with the tag sorting, I can re-create this now in GoodTask. For example, I can take all of the tasks in my Nerd Life<sup id=\"fnref-1579-affectionate\"><a href=\"#fn-1579-affectionate\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup>, apply the tags, and have the list sorted on them. While it may not be quite as pretty as the Things implementation, the capability in GoodTask allows me to break it down to key areas just the same.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1583\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/goodtask-4-5-checking-all-the-boxes\/nerd_life_things_gt\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?fit=2710%2C2616&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2710,2616\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Nerd_Life_Things_GT\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?fit=450%2C434&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?fit=840%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?resize=840%2C810&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"810\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1583\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?resize=1024%2C988&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?resize=450%2C434&amp;ssl=1 450w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?resize=768%2C741&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?resize=1200%2C1158&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?w=1680&amp;ssl=1 1680w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Nerd_Life_Things_GT.png?w=2520&amp;ssl=1 2520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Another key feature of Things that I adore is the Today view. Having your tasks along with the calendar is a fantastic singular view of what is ahead of me. Having a separate &#8216;today&#8217; and &#8216;evening&#8217; section has been critical for me to quickly view and clarify what needs to be done. Now with the tag sorting, I can recreate this view in GoodTask. I created a Smart List which includes my calendar, tasks scheduled for today, and any overdue tasks. This list is sorted by Tag then Due Date, and I also have my calendar events sorted on top, listed under the order section. I created a quick action to apply a <code>#Today<\/code> and <code>#Evening<\/code> tag as a toggle, so that I can quickly tag tasks which show up in the view. Again, this might not be as visually appealing as the Things view, but it provides me what I need while keeping the native Reminders service integration.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1582\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/goodtask-4-5-checking-all-the-boxes\/gt_today_view\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?fit=2630%2C1908&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2630,1908\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"GT_Today_View\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?fit=450%2C326&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?fit=840%2C609&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?resize=840%2C609&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"840\" height=\"609\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1582\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?resize=1024%2C743&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?resize=450%2C326&amp;ssl=1 450w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?resize=768%2C557&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?resize=1200%2C871&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?w=1680&amp;ssl=1 1680w, https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/GT_Today_View.png?w=2520&amp;ssl=1 2520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Completing Tasks<\/h3>\n<p>For a while now, I&#8217;ve been wanting to see more <a href=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/rethinking-reminders\/\">improvements to Reminders<\/a>, but lately I&#8217;ve been wanting improved support within Shortcuts. When I think of what I want Shortcuts to ultimately be, I can&#8217;t help but want certain features added: for Reminders, having the ability to check off a task would be beneficial for certain shortcuts. So while we wait Shortcuts.app to catch up, GoodTask has added a Siri Shortcut to complete a task (and do so in the background). You&#8217;ll need to go to Settings → Siri Shortcuts → Add Complete Task to get the Siri Shortcut and\/or add it to Shortcuts.app.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m getting old, so I take vitamins. I use a reminder to trigger this, so I don&#8217;t forget. I took this one step further and created a shortcut to run on my iPhone which logs the vitamin intake – including all the breakdown of the various types of vitamins – into the Health app, as well as mark it in Streaks as complete to help me keep track of when I&#8217;ve taken it. I always thought it would be nice to complete the reminder as well, but I the lack of the feature has prevented it. But now, I can copy the exact title of the task (and it must be exact) for my vitamins, add a text block and some clipboard actions to save and retrieve,<sup id=\"fnref-1579-implementation\"><a href=\"#fn-1579-implementation\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup> then add the GoodTask Complete Task action block; I also turned off the &#8220;Show When Run&#8221; option so that it runs seamlessly in the background.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1584\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/nahumck.me\/goodtask-4-5-checking-all-the-boxes\/vitamins_gt_complete\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=1325%2C2616&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1325,2616\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Vitamins_GT_Complete\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=228%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?fit=519%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=228%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1584\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=228%2C450&amp;ssl=1 228w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=768%2C1516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=519%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 519w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?resize=1200%2C2369&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/nahumck.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vitamins_GT_Complete.png?w=1325&amp;ssl=1 1325w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 85vw, 228px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I use the native Reminders notifications due to the fact that they remain on the lock screen, but actions like the one outlined above have me rethinking that approach. GoodTask allows users to run a URL from the notification, which means I could run the shortcut straight from the notification and complete it all in one go. I&#8217;ll likely look to play around with this as time goes on.<sup id=\"fnref-1579-breath\"><a href=\"#fn-1579-breath\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The full list of improvements can be <a href=\"https:\/\/forum.goodtaskapp.com\/t\/goodtask-4-5-update\/157\/3\">found on the forums<\/a>.

The developer is listening to suggestions, is adding features at a manageable pace, and I can really appreciate the level of continued development for the app.<\/p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr \/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1579-affectionate\">\nThis is my own affectionate name for these things.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-1579-affectionate\">&#8617;<\/a>\n<\/li>\n<li id=\"fn-1579-implementation\">\nI wish they would fix this so that I can just use text and not have the extra blocks.

Video editing supports all video formats captured on iPhone, including video in 4K at 60 fps and slo-mo in 1080p at 240fps. \n- [ ] Apple’s native Notes app appears completely unchanged to me??? As in... it’s still immediately unusable because of its tacky-ass leather stucco-ish background texture.\n\n### Apple Maps\n- [ ] **MAPS...

I’m starting to suspect that Apple must surely have some sort of good practice standard which such a feature would violate because even [my own quick-disable shortcut](https:\/\/shortcutsgallery.com\/shortcuts\/turn-off-bluetooth-wifi\/) has inexplicably ceased functioning in the past 6 months. :(\n\n[image:D79067AB-E13E-4CC4-9C84-83452A305849-2324-000000A8F61C9F1D\/sharesheetdark.png]\n\n### Notes\nThough I was just defending skeuomorphism, I have somehow managed to hate everything about the way iOS’ native Notes app has looked since the very beginning.\n\n### Safari\nI’m sad to say, is still far from the most effective browser available on iOS - I decided to swap it back in to slot #1 on my doc, replacing [Firefox](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/firefox-private-safe-browser\/id989804926) for the duration of this experience. \nIn keeping with that comparison: [Firefox 12 for iOS](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2018\/06\/12\/firefox-12-ios-file-downloads-easier-syncing\/) introduced a Downloads manager & folder, “unified link management,” and iCloud sync in February of last year, which left the native Safari at perhaps its lowest point of regard on iPhone. For most of us UX obsessives, it has only been launched in the time since by hyperlinks from the few good apps remaining which still do not offer a default preference to Chrome and\/or Firefox. One would imagine, then, that the iOS Safari team has been under substantial internal pressure to deliver a miraculous rework\/featureset bent on conquering the hearts of app critics and powerusers once again. Unfortunately, the version I’ve been subjecting myself to  in iOS 13 Beta smells an awful lot like defeatism.\n\n- [ ] Tab switching is still the smoothest-animated, but remains by far the slowest and most crashy of all the mainstream mobile browsers.\n\n- [ ] Unfortunately, it’s quite pitiful when Apple *invents* features months\/years after the *alternative* crowd mastered them *on the fringe* with zero disadvantages. There *are* some genuinely-clever additions like **saving open tabs as bookmarks**, and informed folks like *[Gadget Hacks](https:\/\/ios.gadgethacks.com\/news\/20-features-ios-13s-safari-you-wont-want-miss-0198425\/)* who’ve described it as “formidable,” yet many of their citations invoke token Apple jokes. *Thank you so much, your majesties, for giving us this new gift of your genius... The Start Page*.\n\n- [ ] The one ever-improving advantage of using native Safari which I think we can all agree on aligns with Apple’s new - and actually quite admirable - **privacy and security-founded brand identity**. (\n\n- [ ] > A new downloads folder gives you a central place to access your web downloads and attachments from Safari and Mail.\n\n### Siri\n- [ ] Siri is my favorite voice assistant because she’s by far the biggest idiot of the bunch, yet I’ve found her to *actually* add real functionality to my experience.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts \n- [ ] The new “Quickpath” swiping keyboard makes zero sense as a feature add at this point, but okay Craig.\n- [ ] Fucking **VALIDATED** by the attention to keyboard shortcuts (most of the big-deal PadOS’ new shortcuts seem to have been tossed in the iPhone too. God Bless.) Very nice of Craig Apple... I am the only iPhone user in history who has (and continues to) ever made use of this feature more than once. (I didn’t have a laptop in Community College so I just fooled around in Evernote, hunched over my little iPhone 4S to reach the fucking thing.)\n*Specifically* though... I can’t find any direct mention of it in Apple’s current preview documentation, but Command-Space shows\/hides **Spotlight**, which is the only way to switch between apps without the touchscreen (I can’t seem to find a definite answer on whether or not Command-Tab ever functionally switch applications on iPhone, but I think I would remember it.) This function has always been just clunky enough to interrupt a good workflow.\nFor instance, let’s say I needed to switch from this very document in Bear to YouTube in order to grab a hyperlink to a [quick demo capture](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Yt5lPqn2i6M). Here’s what my keystrokes would look like:\n`Command Space y o u tab enter`\n[file:6188C492-DBC7-4202-BC04-7FB275BB5FBD-2140-0000008B622330B3\/IMG_9033.MP4]\n- [ ]  The various performance updates might seem like a bonus to some, but those of us who’ve been paying attention (out of need or curiosity) to the *absolutely absurd* size of regular app updates to date find the rework of software packages in iOS 13  (claimed 50% smaller App Store packages and 60% smaller updates) to be nothing more than a monstrously-late address to conclude *years* of gross negligence. (Remember we’re talking about the world’s richest company, here...

    "content" : "# Last Year of the NC: 2013 Mazda MX-5 Club Review\n11 Oct 2012\n#### by [David Blue](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel)\n\n![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review\/IMG_9562.JPG)\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Full](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RIl7x6g.jpeg)\n## As we bid farewell to the Miata’s third-generation, sizing up its top trim summarizes its legacy.\nI recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5. This is the first time the looks of the perky roadster have changed since the front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of insanity in 2008. They have once again dulled it to what I would call a smirk. The new front end blends with the rest of car more than it has in the past. It seems to have grown a bit more serious. In fact, with black 17-inch alloys on a glossy black (creatively called \"Brilliant Black,\") this example is the most aggressive-looking of any Miata I have seen.\n\nThat's not to say it's aggressive in the slightest, even in such a scheme. This car is in the “Club” trim replacing the previous “Touring” designation as the top-of-the-line option. This selection adds ridiculous three-leaf clover side badges, red stitching on the seats, red stripes on the dash and sides, along with a price tag very near 30,000 USD.\n \n![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review\/IMG_9563.JPG)\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Badging](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/edJ18j9.jpeg)\n\nSo I present you with my first problem with this particular car....it's a contradiction. The MX-5 was never intended to look serious. That grin was there to convey the primary attribute aspired to by its creators; joy. It's designed to be joyful in driving and the exterior of previous generations did a good job of communicating what the car is all about. Unfortunately, it seems they have decided that it's time for the roadster to grow up. Frankly, that's not going to work.\n\nNow, to the drive.\n\nFor this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response quickened, as well as the throttle response in manual-equipped cars. Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed automatic with optional pattle-shifters. Given that this is my first drive in an NC (third generation) MX-5, I can only compare it to my own NB.\n\n![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review\/IMG_9570.JPG)\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Trunk](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AwmhWqh.jpeg)\n\nImmediately, my passenger and chaperon starts the process of opening the optional retractable hard top. Open air is this car's natural environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making sure its occupants never notice. Wind buffeting has been drastically reduced. We were able to maintain conversation beyond 70mph without necessitating shouting thanks to a much taller wind brake behind our seats. Unfortunately, I couldn't really hear much of anything from the 158-hp 2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal amounts of right foot burying. It would seem the optional dual exhaust outlets are rather pointless then.\n\n![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review\/IMG_9566.JPG)\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Engine](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jF3z0Qc.jpeg)\n\nGetting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by the 6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with an automatic is sort of like going on a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn't necessarily ruin the immediate experience but you'll always have some regret regarding the subject in the future. The pattles add some of the fun back in, but I prefer the Golf GTI's arrangement of right side-shift up, left side-shift down, while the MX-5 has both functions on either side of the wheel.\n\nIt took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won't effect your daily driving experience. Another plus; when in manual shift mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will allow you to exceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being nannied when you're first told that you're in control can be a major annoyance. (Looking at you, Kia Forte.) It's disappointing that Mazda chose only to up throttle response in manual-equipped cars. This one most certainly needed it.\n\nThe original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication between driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase “Jinba Ittai,” meaning “rider and horse are one.” Being an MX-5 owner, this philosophy is very important to me, thus my expectations for the steering were very high. It was very disappointing, then, to discover that it has been very nearly ruined.\n\n![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review\/IMG_9568.JPG)\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Driver’s Side](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/dLg41pi.jpeg)\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not very generous in revealing the road. In corners it felt jumpy, imprecise, and unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence was noticeable in a straight line as well, along with a nervous fidget. Keep in mind, I am comparing this to roadsters of the past, not to other automobiles currently on the market. It would take a global nuclear war to make the MX-5 less fun to drive than a Toyota Camry.\n\nThough it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a more comfortable suspension and oodles of storage space. The trunk is massive for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equipped with an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The center console contains two reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that will inevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham also pointed out to me that the track on which the door slides appears vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose.\n\n![](Last%20Year%20of%20the%20NC%202013%20Mazda%20MX-5%20Club%20Review\/IMG_9571.JPG)\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Center Console](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/fTXsEEn.jpeg)\n\nIn general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience, albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has “grown up,” forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the opposite of the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be an aggressive-looking performance car, and it will never do well as one. It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either.\n\nIts soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I'm afraid it's losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you're attracted by the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a Subaru BRZ\/Toyota GT 86\/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come lightly or easily.\n\nUntil Mazda gets wise about what it's doing to the beloved little car, I'm afraid it's headed down a path that will mean losing a grip on the niche it's held for so long, and that's quite saddening.\n \n[2013 Mazda MX-5 Miata Club | Autoblog](https:\/\/www.autoblog.com\/2012\/11\/20\/2013-mazda-mx-5-miata-club\/)\n\n#auto",

    "content" : "2019 Jeep Compass 4x4 Limited\r\nIf you've paid any attention to my sparse autowriting since 2013, you might've noticed that I've found myself chronicling my journey to kill every last brand bias-born ignorant assumption within my perspective for clarity's sake. It required Juke NISMO and Xterra wheeltime for me to understand the strengths of my favorite adolescent target, Nissan, and just one night out with the CrossCabriolet to see its shortcomings. Eight years in proximity to CR-V ownership in tandem with an active academic effort to look at South Korea's then-upcoming place in the industry empirically let down the mystical aura in which Honda once dwelled for me throughout my later childhood. Driving the EcoBoost Mustang in Portland last year was a brutally epiphanous smack in the face as I began to realize just how confused this country's automotive culture is when it comes to our historic brands' identities and how they should be represented in the present. How can marques like \"Mustang\" and \"Jeep\" possibly mean anything after both the engineering and consumer expectations have changed so drastically? For all the marketing, PR, and editorial talent employed by the remaining car giants, one wonders how many live moment to excruciating moment in full-body mortal terror.\r\nI haven't written a car review in years, but I thought I should take the opportunity to confront what I hope to be my last toxic brand bias. Believe it or not, I once had an awfully agricultural driving experience with a restored civilian Willy's from the early 1950s, which couldn't have contrasted more against the past three weeks I've spent with the 2019 Jeep Compass, which has - perhaps above all else - an absolutely horrendous name. It's a cheap joke, but I can't imagine it ever falling flat: that cold, round, steel, entirely unassisted steering wheel has been replaced with a heated leather unit connected to an electromechanical rack that leaves embarrassingly little required effort from its operator. I can't be bothered with a confirmation, but I suspect the lot of it was sourced from Fiat, which would make any old Jeep customer from the Grand Cherokee's golden era fall immediately ill - if you could actually manage to convince them you weren't joking, that is. This model year apparently starts at $21,095, but my \"Limited\"-specced example would manage to set you back a mid-boggling $33,045 with its decently-composed CarPlay-equipped infotainment system, heated leather seats, steering wheel, and door mirrors, keyless entry, and a few more checked checkmarks which aren't particularly relevant or interesting. Considering, I must (perhaps unfairly) insert some conclusive commentary already: this vehicle is fucking overpriced. Pre-research, I was briefly impressed by the rumor that my car was priced almost $8,000 less, which would almost make it a bargain, but - God be with them - there really are Americans out there spending more than $30,000 on these every day.\r\nTo be honest, I'm growing very tired of driving Fiat-Chrysler products that come from the factory completely let down by their drivetrains. It's been over five years since new automatic-equipped Dodge Darts so thoroughly disappointed even the least-discerning owners with its driving behavior thanks to the transmission's horrendously-fudged mapping. The Compass' 9-speed ZF automatic looks great on paper - for some thirty years, the Friedrichshafen name has the badge of the industry's most dynamically capable available pairings with any given luxury power plant - but the reality of Jeep's execution is despicably discouraging. No, it's not as entirely-comprising as the Dart's, but it's certainly bad enough to warrant recommending checking out the \"4x4 Manual\" trim if you insist on Compass ownership, which should at least enable more hands-on drivers to make the best of the model's inescapably inadequate 180 horsepower 2.4 Liter four. It's not hopeless, by any means, but its ~3,500 lb. burden requires a significant amount of work in normal driving from whoever is making gearchange decisions - whether it ultimately be a human being or daftly-programmed computer. Staying with traffic on a typical United States highway will require them often - attacking fairly moderate inclines in such a setting at a cruise controlled 76mph had my example downshifting three whole gears to tackle in a manner noticeable enough to breach the unconscious threshold of even the least mechanically-empathetic operator. \r\nMore than most other categories, the Compass' place among the newborn \"Compact Sport Utility\" segment should be examined with thorough critique. When I brought it up with a good friend of mine, he introduced me to the term \"Mall Crawler,\" which I've desperately needed to describe a specific compartment of local car culture for several years now.\r\nJeep, Nissan, and Subaru have entered into this no man's land of budget-friendly crossovers that straddle the unclaimed dimensionality between subcompact and compact crossovers with the Jeep Compass, Nissan Rogue Sport, and Subaru Crosstrek. Bonus: All three are new to the market this year.\r\nYes, those who are seriously considering a pick from this segment should consider this MotorTrend comparison of the Compass, Rogue Sport, and Crosstrek to be required reading. I haven't driven either of the other two, though - for what it's worth - my sister and brother-in-law bought the latter in 2017 and have nothing but good things to say, which confirms Christian Seabaugh's first place endorsement of Subaru's entry. To him, the \"Trailhawk\"-trimmed Compass \"feels like an old-school body-on-frame SUV,\" which is a considerable compliment, and I'd at least partially concur in the Limited's case. It's important to consider that my Compass was proudly equipped with what Jeep calls \"4WD,\" which is a proclamation I personally hadn't seen branded on any non-pickup automotive products in a long time. (Then again, I'm almost positive I saw such a badge on the back of a fourth-generation CR-V the other day, which seems auspicious, at best.) When I took the opportunity to pilot the confusingly-pseudoplush Compass about a handful of forlorn county gravel roads, it was much more competent than I expected. In fact, I'm not sure I could name a vehicle from my own experience - including a vast assortment of pickups - which was any less perturbed by loose limestone. After manually depressing the \"4wd Lock\" control, it was simply unstickable in the most precarious corner entries my local routes could muster, even when \"fording\" a foot or two-deep crick.\r\n"

There, he discovered that poisonous snakes were a regular and legitimate threat, in rural parts - cottonmouths and copperheads in the grass. To protect himself and the family, he bought a revolver - a Ruger .357 Magnum - and kept it on his hip in a leather holster, loaded with six shotshells - a particular type of cartridge in which a solid projectile is replaced with pellets, essentially turning a rifled handgun into a shotgun. (This sort of ammunition is known colloquially as \"snake shot.\") According to the stories I remember, his preparation proved its worth on several occasions, but by the time I was eight or nine, he'd lived long enough on the North-Mid-Missouri flatland on which I grew up to recognize its comparative lack of natural dangers, and so, the then-weathered Ruger had long been sequestered to a cabinet in the old house's sun porch.\n​​\n​​As strange as my childhood was in comparison to my peers - as much common culture from which I was exempted - the complex stigma of the gun was not included. Though little recollection of that time is at all definite, I do remember a sparked curiosity the first time I stumbled upon it, there, and it was my first expression of this attention that prompted Dad to retrieve it, late one afternoon, and lay it - sans-ammunition, dusty & distressed, but still well-oiled - in front of me upon the short wooden table in the living room with sanded edges for my safety. It's cliche, but it really is the weight - the density of milled steel - that defines one's first impressions, holding a real handgun.  Considering the sentiments my father would express as I shifted its weight to and fro by way of the old handgrip's grain and cycled the action with its serrated hammer, he made no particular ceremony of the occasion. It was from behind an oaken half wall, seated at his computer desk, out of sight, that he told me what it all meant. Whether by design or not, I believe it was essential how calmly he explained its function as a weapon - exactly what it could do, and when - where it and its ammunition were kept, and the ideal attitude with which to regard it: respect without fear.\n​​\n​​To be afraid of it, he explained, could be just as dangerous as handling it recklessly, like a toy, and I'd like to think it was due in large part to his delivery of this advisory that led to the instincts still ingrained in the deepest parts of my psyche to this day. Perhaps it was my Germanic obsession with mechanical relationships that lent toward precocious knowledge and appreciation (ripening incubators of respect) for the precision and physics involved in engineering a firearm, which quickly sated any juvenile, maliciously exploratory curiosities, and formed the essence of my particular motivation to handle weapons: to experience - and later master - their operation. It wouldn't be until early adolescence that I'd have to confront the basal human psychology of the power of the gun, as is notably inevitable in the conversation, but I believe it was the nature and volume of my exposure, in childhood, that would leave me ideally prepared.\n​​\n​​In reflection, it's obvious that my father didn't care much for weapons. From a devotee's perspective, the Ruger and his well-worn lever-action, .308 Savage 99 - which he kept in his pickup for coyotes and trespassers in the Georgian era - were rather neglected, and virtually irrelevant in day-to-day life. There were a couple of dusty shotguns, somewhere, with which he had allegedly hunted ducks and pheasants from the blind with friends and siblings, but they were far from his first thought upon the sight of either fowl, in the field, and the duck-themed depictions throughout the house - of which there were many - were haplessly reverent paintings and fading quilted patterns instead of stuffed trophies. (There were also at least two painted wooden carvings.)\n​​\n​​Dad's inability to muster any believable bloodlust helped us understand one another, in this regard. I began just wanting to shoot the gun, apathetic as to any particular target; he preferred nurturing to destruction, and would've rather spent the time tending to his garden.\n​​\n​​Shortly after my first education with the revolver, he bought me a Daisy Red Ryder BB gun - as decrepit and cliche of an American rite of passage as the Pledge of Allegiance, vacation bible school, and the ancient, exhausting film A Christmas Story (and its local and curricular theatre adaptations,) from which you likely know its brand and cheeky, painfully-suburban accompanying catchphrase: you'll shoot your eye out. They can be had 'for $30 apiece from your nearest Cracker Barrel (undoubtedly the most surreal and horrific American dining experience imaginable for any visiting foreigner unfortunate enough to wander in,) and virtually every single male relative had at least one of the miserable things lying around. Once, while I was visiting family in central Illinois, my same-age second cousin demonstrated for me his intermittent hobby of shooting BBs into the sides of grazing cattle behind his farmhouse, which I found - even minus any tangible ability to empathize with any living thing - to be a pointless and unamusing infliction of suffering. (He insisted that the spherical metallic projectiles couldn't possibly penetrate their hides at the Daisy's rudimentary pneumatic-launched velocities, but they didn't seem to find it very cute.)\n​​\n​​I, myself possessed a particular disdain for approximations of adult things as a child, and never accomplished much with my Red Ryder save for the inadvertent maiming of an ancient, humongous toad, for which I shall surely suffer some excruciating and grotesque ailment, by karma, at some future date. It did at least fulfill its intended role as training wheels for the traditional mindfulness my father required I demonstrate before he'd let me wander around the bordering forests and half-dozen ponds of the 800-acre farm with a real firearm, and the wait was not long.\n​​\n​​If memory serves, I was a month from turning eleven years old when Dad acquired for me - through some obscure dealer - a gorgeous, limited-edition black-on-cherry bolt-action Marlin .22 rifle for Christmas - an object which quickly stirred within me an affection unlike any I should hope to experience ever again. I've been unable to forget the smell of its powder discharge mixed with gun oil before passing through my runny nose on that first frigid Winter outing as I cycled my perceptibly unlimited supply of little rimfire cartridges through its seven-round magazine. Though I have yet to live through a quarter-century, my experiences with my .22 happened in a different era, entirely, when 1000-round boxes of Remington brand full metal jacket or hollowpoint ammunition could be found in the sporting goods section of any ole big-box store for fifteen dollars. According to my sparse contact with enthusiasts in the decade since I last held my rifle, a stockpiling frenzy coinciding with the inauguration of Barack Obama has left retailers more or less powerless to keep up with demand, suddenly eliminating a stigma of reassuring excess that had pervaded, unshaken for a hundred years of American recreational shooting.\n​​\n​​My prepubescent supply, though, was a challenge to diminish, if anything, which quickly metamorphosed nearly every object in my isolated world into a fair-game target. When my father retired to his midday naps, I'd fill the pockets of my Vietnam-era Army jacket with a few handfuls of loose, clinking ammo and my extra magazine before venturing out - regardless of the season - to walk my work boots over tasseling fescue grass, around barbed wire fences, through steel & aluminum gates, under pin oaks, maples, cedars, and foul, parasitic locust trees - over rows of soybeans and between itchy, towering corn stalks with that magnificent, richly-aromatic thing rested on my shoulder, looking for the right squirrel's nest, splintered fence post, or fossilized implement remnant to pump a few rounds in. At first, I was alone, but we'd soon bring home a zealous three-month-old yellow Labrador named Dolly that summer, who's unlimited energy and zest for life propelled her from puppyhood to ninety-pound cruise-missile-of-the-brush status in a single school year, and instilled in her the wholehearted adoration of freedom necessary to become the perfect boyhood companion. For a young man in those early stages of independence-seeking, responsibility-worshiping development, it was a novel paradise - the stuff of fiction.\n​​\n​​North by any substantial distance from the geological consequences of dearest Big Muddy's path, the meat of Missouri is flat. Fucking flat. In daylight, one's field of vision - one's entire world - is constricted by the limitations of Earth's curvature, which dooms his\/her\/their horizon to fall away after just three miles, at eye level, confining the maximum possible diameter of my home planet to approximately six miles, in ideal conditions.\n"

We will cooperate with any law enforcement officials or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone broadcasting or otherwise making available any materials that are believed to violate these TOS. Without limiting any other remedies Ustream may have, Ustream may terminate your Ustream account and\/or use of the Site and Subscription Software and Related Services, if Ustream becomes aware that you have violated these TOS.\n\nThe Ustream Site and Related Services are not designed to comply with any specific governmental regulation or specific security measures. You agree not to input content that may be subject to any such regulations or required additional security measures. You are responsible for all necessary permissions to include the content in the Site and Related Services and you grant Ustream permission to use, store and process the content in the Site and Related Services. The Site and Related Services are not intended for the storage or receipt of any: 1) personal data and other data, the loss of which would trigger a data breach notification requirement, or 2) health information, including without limitation individually identifiable health information as defined under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended. You will be responsible for all costs Ustream may incur relating to any such information made available by you to the Site and Related Services, including those arising out of any third party claims.\n\nEligibility and Registration.\nYou must be at least 18 years of age to use our Subscription Software and Related Services. If you wish to access certain Subscription Software and Related Services, you will be required to create an account.\nWhen you register with Ustream and set up your Subscription Software accounts, you agree to provide Ustream with accurate, true, current, and complete information. You agree to promptly update your information for your Subscription Software account(s) on an ongoing basis. You authorize Ustream, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary or appropriate to verify your information for your Subscription Software account(s). You agree that you will not use false identities or impersonate any other person or use a username or password that you are not authorized to use.\nYou are responsible for safeguarding your account administration password(s) and you agree not to disclose your password(s) to any third party. You are solely responsible for any activities or actions taken under your password(s), whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password. Ustream reserves the right to require you to change your username or password for any reason and at any time.\nModification.\n1. Ustream reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate all or a portion of the Subscription Software and Related Services, or to modify these TOS, at any time and without advance notice. If we modify these TOS, we will update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these TOS. If any modified terms and conditions are not acceptable to you, your sole remedy is to cease using the Subscription Software and Related Services. By continuing to access or use the Subscription Software and Related Services after Ustream makes any such revision, you agree to be bound by the revised TOS.\nFees and Payment.\nEach of our Subscription Software and Related Services offerings have defined fees for use and overages (collectively, the “Fees”), some of which may be recurring on a monthly, quarterly, annually, or some other period of time. You will have an opportunity to review and accept the Fees and billing cycle for your chosen Subscription Software and Related Services either through our Site or as part of your Sales Order. Ustream reserves the right to change the Fees and\/or billing cycles for our Subscription Software and Related Services at any time, but any such changes will only apply prospectively.\nAll Fees are due in advance of receiving any services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a current Sales Order with Ustream your Fees will be invoiced upon you signing your Sales Order and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date, unless otherwise set forth in the Sales Order. Subsequent payments for the services will be invoiced in advance (except for any overages, which will be invoiced monthly in arrears unless otherwise stated) and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of invoice date or the monthly, quarterly or annual billing date, as applicable. Late payment fees may apply. All invoices will be sent to the billing contact and address information shown on your Sales Order. Unless otherwise set forth in your Sales Order, all Fees are recurring (until terminated) and charged to you regardless whether or not you use the Subscription Software and Related Services. If you choose to enroll in Subscription Software and Related Services that have recurring Fees, you agree that Ustream may automatically charge the recurring Fees to your chosen payment method at the beginning of each billing cycle.\nAll fees and charges are expressed as exclusive of any Transaction Tax (including, but not limited to value added, goods and services, consumption, sales, use, stamp tax, personal property tax) customs or other duty, tax, or similar levies (collectively “Taxes”). If any Taxes are imposed by any authority on or in connection with your acquisitions under the Agreement, the applicable Taxes will be added to the charges payable by you to Ustream. You will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all Taxes to Ustream. To the extent that Ustream and you agree that no Transaction Tax is chargeable by Ustream on your acquisition of Subscription Software and Related Services, you warrant to provide Ustream with any required exemption certificates or other applicable documentation or information to evidence the non-charging of Transaction Taxes. \nWhere taxes are based upon the location(s) receiving the benefit of the Subscription Software and Related Services, you have an ongoing obligation to notify Ustream of such location(s) if different than the business address that you provided for billing purposes. \nIn the event that you provide inaccurate information or fail to update Ustream with any change in status relevant to taxation, you indemnify and hold Ustream harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for Transaction Taxes, interest and penalties levied as a result of your misinformation. \nYou agree to: i) pay withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to Ustream; iii) pay Ustream only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with Ustream in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents.\nThe services you order will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account, or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these TOS. You must cancel your subscription at least 30 days before it renews in order to avoid a charge for the next billing cycle. UNLESS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN A SALES ORDER, ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.\nIf you fail to meet your payment obligations, Ustream reserves the right to terminate your relevant Subscription Software account(s), convert your account to a Basic Services Ustream account (upon which advertisements will appear on your User Submissions), charge you an overage or other fees, or take any other action which we deem to be reasonable, and your continued use will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services.\nTermination and Effect of Termination\nTermination by Ustream. Ustream reserves the right to immediately terminate or suspend your account or your access to any or all of the Subscription Software and Related Services and remove any material (including User Submissions (as defined below)) from the Subscription Software and Related Services or our servers at any time with or without cause and without notice. This includes, without limitation, terminating or suspending your account if the charges to your credit card or our Fees are refused or otherwise not paid for any reason. If Ustream terminates all or a portion of your Subscription Software and Related Services prior to the completion of the term of your Sales Order with Ustream for such services stated online or in a Sales Order (“Term”), you are still liable for paying all outstanding Fees and charges incurred prior to termination and your sole remedy against Ustream is a pro-rata refund of the purchase price paid in advance (if any) for the unavailable service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if termination of your account or access to services is as a result of your breach of these TOS or a Sales Order, Ustream will have no liability to you and you will be solely liable for the full amount of any Fees owed and contracted for with us and any outstanding charges relating to your account.\nTermination by You. You may terminate your Ustream account(s) at any time and for any reason by contacting us at billing@ustream.tv or, if available to you, selecting “Close Account” in your account preferences. Subscription Software and Related Services Fees are non-refundable and if you choose to terminate your Subscription Software and Related Services prior to the end of the Term (excluding a termination due to non-monetary causes beyond your control that exceeds 30 days). You agree to pay any outstanding Fees contracted for under your Sales Order with Ustream and\/or outstanding charges relating to your account.\nEffect of Termination. Once your Subscription Software and Related Services account is terminated, and unless otherwise agreed by you and Ustream, your account will be converted to a Basic Services account and your continued use (including the continued hosting of your User Submissions on our servers) will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services. Ustream will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in our database related to your account or to forward any information to you or any third party, including User Submissions. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you by these TOS will immediately cease. Ustream is not liable to you or any third party for any alleged or actual damages, losses, or claims related to the termination of the Subscription Software and Related Services or termination of your use of the Subscription Software and Related Services.\nUpgrading or Downgrading Your Account.\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your Subscription Software and Related Services account if available to you through your Ustream Dashboard, available at http:\/\/www.ustream.tv\/dashboard, although in some instances, you may need to contact us directly.\nUpgrades will be applied retroactively to the beginning of the current billing cycle. Any usage in the current billing cycle will be charged under the new plan rates. At the time you choose to upgrade, you will be charged the difference between your old plan rate and the new plan rate. Your billing date will remain the same as your original billing date.\nDowngrades will not take effect until the commencement of the next billing cycle. On your next billing date, you will be charged (if at all) under the new plan rates. You will not be refunded for any unused portion of the current billing cycle. Downgrading your plan may cause loss of features or functionality. Ustream will not be liable to you or any third party for any downgrading and Ustream will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in our data centers related to your account or to forward any information to you or any third party.\nGrant of License; Intellectual Property Rights.\n“Content” means, collectively, the text, data, graphics, images, logos, trademarks, photos and video files, organization, compilation and overall look and feel of Ustream’s offerings made available by Ustream through the Subscription Software and Related Services, but excluding User Submissions. “User Submissions” means, collectively, the text, data, graphics, images, photos and video files and other content and information which Ustream members or our other third-party licensors stream, post, upload and otherwise submit to the Subscription Software and Related Services, including without limitation in broadcast chats, discussion groups, message boards and Ustream member-created profile pages. Ustream reserves the right to remove and permanently delete any Content or User Submissions without notice. We have the right to cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting publishing or otherwise making available any User Submissions, emails or other materials that are believed to violate these TOS.\nWe and our licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Subscription Software and Related Services and the Content.

At Ustream’s request and expense, you will execute documents and take such further acts as Ustream may reasonably request to assist Ustream to acquire, perfect and maintain its intellectual property rights and other legal protections for the Feedback. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Ustream is engaged in creating and developing its own programs, plans and projects so it is possible that we are already independently developing products services, plans and projects that are quite similar and\/or competitive with your Feedback (including the concepts contemplated by or embodied therein). Nothing in these TOS will be construed as a representation or agreement that we will not develop or have developed, distribute, market or promote applications, services, products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to and\/or compete with the applications, services, products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in any Feedback or compensate you or provide you with any input or response with regard to your Feedback.\n\nGeneral.\nAssignment.

(“Ustream”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our website accessible at www.ustream.tv (the “Site”) and our proprietary video player platform which enables the sharing of live and recorded video and audio content and chat on the Internet and via computers and mobile devices by our users (any and all of the foregoing (the “Services”). The Services include Ustream’s proprietary embeddable video players, the Ustream channels, our software applications (including any updates, new versions or new releases thereof) including, but not limited to, our viewer, broadcaster and recorder applications.\n\nAs used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within the United States or internationally.\n\nInformation Collection and Use\nOur primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, features and content, to administer your membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. We also may also use your information in order to better understand how our Services are used.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information.\n\nIn the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.\nPlease be aware that when you register to become a Ustream Member, other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post to the Site or submit via the Services. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you. If your use of the Services violates or potentially violates Ustream’s Acceptable Use Policy, your Personal Information may be shared with law enforcement and other third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to all applicable laws.\nWe also collect the other information that you provide as part of your use of the Services, including via your registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation zip code, gender, age and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Ustream Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used.\nWe also use your Personal Information to contact you with Ustream newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. Ustream Members who agree to the terms and conditions of the Ustream Terms of Service Agreement are given the opportunity to opt-in to receiving such communications from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)\nUstream will also share and use your Personal Information with Ustream Asia, and other networks, websites and entities affiliated, owned, controlled and\/or connected with Ustream. We will use your Personal Information in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nAt times, we may offer special access to pay-per-view or other special promotional events (e.g., live broadcast of concerts), and we may share your Personal Information with those entities and advertisers that are participating in such event. Unless otherwise stated, we will only share your name and email address to the such parties, so you may receive newsletters or promotional materials from such entities.\nSurveys and Promotions. From time to time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a “Promotion”) via our Services. If you participate in a Promotion we will request certain Personal Information from you. We use the Personal Information you provide to us in these instances to administer your participation in the Promotion. Participation in a Promotion is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.\n\nLog Data. As you use the Services, whether as a Ustream Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Ustream User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This log data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.\n\nCookies\nLike many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your encrypted registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site as well as display preference settings (such as preferred language). Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Ustream Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.\n\nWe may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Pixel Tags”) in connection with our Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.\n\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\nUstream Members. When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, Ustream Users will see your “Screen Name” and the month and year you first registered with Ustream (“Required Member Identifiers”). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (“Other Member Information”) and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly on the Site by making selections via the “user preferences” section of your profile webpage. Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Ustream Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information.\n\nNotifications and Following other Ustream Members. Ustream Members can also choose to join a “crowd” of other Ustream Members and follow their favorite Ustream broadcaster. If you choose to follow another Ustream Member, you will provide that Ustream Member with your public Ustream identity. By joining the crowd of another Ustream member, you also opt-in for notifications sent to you within the Ustream platform. You may also be followed outside of the Ustream platform, if you expose and make public your identity, email address and social network identity.\n\nAggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.\n\nService Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (each a “Service Provider”). The types of Service Providers we use include, without limitation, those that provide the following types of services: credit card processing, accounting, customer relationship management, website maintenance, notification services, database management and web analytics. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.\n\nSpotXchange. SpotXchange serves ads on the Site and through the Services and collects information about users’ interaction with those ads, as described in the SpotXchange Privacy Policy, located at http:\/\/www.spotxchange.com\/spx_privacypolicy.html.\n\nThird Party Social Networking Services. As a Ustream Member you can link your account information with certain social networking services (“SNSs”) and broadcast your activities and other data to your friends. In these instances, depending on the “user preferences” you set in your Ustream account, with your permission and on your behalf we will share the information contained in your Ustream account (e.g., Ustream profile page, channel page and any other information you deem public in any content you create on the Site) with the SNS. We also receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal information a SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other online services you use.\n\nCompliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Ustream cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ustream or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.\n\nBusiness Transfers. Ustream may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. If Ustream becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice to you before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n\nChanging or Deleting Your Information\nAll Ustream Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request. See below for privacy contact information.\n\nSecurity\nUstream is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\nWe will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.\n\nInternational Transfer\nYour information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Ustream transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.\n\nLinks to Other Sites\nThe Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

If any modified terms and conditions are not acceptable to you, your sole remedy is to cease using the Subscription Software and Related Services. By continuing to access or use the Subscription Software and Related Services after Ustream makes any such revision, you agree to be bound by the revised TOS.\nFees and Payment.\nEach of our Subscription Software and Related Services offerings have defined fees for use and overages (collectively, the “Fees”), some of which may be recurring on a monthly, quarterly, annually, or some other period of time. You will have an opportunity to review and accept the Fees and billing cycle for your chosen Subscription Software and Related Services either through our Site or as part of your Sales Order. Ustream reserves the right to change the Fees and\/or billing cycles for our Subscription Software and Related Services at any time, but any such changes will only apply prospectively.\nAll Fees are due in advance of receiving any services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a current Sales Order with Ustream your Fees will be invoiced upon you signing your Sales Order and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date, unless otherwise set forth in the Sales Order. Subsequent payments for the services will be invoiced in advance (except for any overages, which will be invoiced monthly in arrears unless otherwise stated) and are due and payable within fifteen (15) days of invoice date or the monthly, quarterly or annual billing date, as applicable. Late payment fees may apply. All invoices will be sent to the billing contact and address information shown on your Sales Order. Unless otherwise set forth in your Sales Order, all Fees are recurring (until terminated) and charged to you regardless whether or not you use the Subscription Software and Related Services. If you choose to enroll in Subscription Software and Related Services that have recurring Fees, you agree that Ustream may automatically charge the recurring Fees to your chosen payment method at the beginning of each billing cycle.\nAll fees and charges are expressed as exclusive of any Transaction Tax (including, but not limited to value added, goods and services, consumption, sales, use, stamp tax, personal property tax) customs or other duty, tax, or similar levies (collectively “Taxes”). If any Taxes are imposed by any authority on or in connection with your acquisitions under the Agreement, the applicable Taxes will be added to the charges payable by you to Ustream. You will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all Taxes to Ustream. To the extent that Ustream and you agree that no Transaction Tax is chargeable by Ustream on your acquisition of Subscription Software and Related Services, you warrant to provide Ustream with any required exemption certificates or other applicable documentation or information to evidence the non-charging of Transaction Taxes. \nWhere taxes are based upon the location(s) receiving the benefit of the Subscription Software and Related Services, you have an ongoing obligation to notify Ustream of such location(s) if different than the business address that you provided for billing purposes. \nIn the event that you provide inaccurate information or fail to update Ustream with any change in status relevant to taxation, you indemnify and hold Ustream harmless against any and all claims by any tax authority for Transaction Taxes, interest and penalties levied as a result of your misinformation. \nYou agree to: i) pay withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to Ustream; iii) pay Ustream only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with Ustream in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents.\nThe services you order will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your subscription or the account, or service is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these TOS. You must cancel your subscription at least 30 days before it renews in order to avoid a charge for the next billing cycle. UNLESS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN A SALES ORDER, ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.\nIf you fail to meet your payment obligations, Ustream reserves the right to terminate your relevant Subscription Software account(s), convert your account to a Basic Services Ustream account (upon which advertisements will appear on your User Submissions), charge you an overage or other fees, or take any other action which we deem to be reasonable, and your continued use will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services.\nTermination and Effect of Termination\nTermination by Ustream. Ustream reserves the right to immediately terminate or suspend your account or your access to any or all of the Subscription Software and Related Services and remove any material (including User Submissions (as defined below)) from the Subscription Software and Related Services or our servers at any time with or without cause and without notice. This includes, without limitation, terminating or suspending your account if the charges to your credit card or our Fees are refused or otherwise not paid for any reason. If Ustream terminates all or a portion of your Subscription Software and Related Services prior to the completion of the term of your Sales Order with Ustream for such services stated online or in a Sales Order (“Term”), you are still liable for paying all outstanding Fees and charges incurred prior to termination and your sole remedy against Ustream is a pro-rata refund of the purchase price paid in advance (if any) for the unavailable service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if termination of your account or access to services is as a result of your breach of these TOS or a Sales Order, Ustream will have no liability to you and you will be solely liable for the full amount of any Fees owed and contracted for with us and any outstanding charges relating to your account.\nTermination by You. You may terminate your Ustream account(s) at any time and for any reason by contacting us at billing@ustream.tv or, if available to you, selecting “Close Account” in your account preferences.

You agree to pay any outstanding Fees contracted for under your Sales Order with Ustream and\/or outstanding charges relating to your account.\nEffect of Termination. Once your Subscription Software and Related Services account is terminated, and unless otherwise agreed by you and Ustream, your account will be converted to a Basic Services account and your continued use (including the continued hosting of your User Submissions on our servers) will be subject to the Terms and Conditions for Basic Services. Ustream will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in our database related to your account or to forward any information to you or any third party, including User Submissions. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you by these TOS will immediately cease. Ustream is not liable to you or any third party for any alleged or actual damages, losses, or claims related to the termination of the Subscription Software and Related Services or termination of your use of the Subscription Software and Related Services.\nUpgrading or Downgrading Your Account.\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your Subscription Software and Related Services account if available to you through your Ustream Dashboard, available at http:\/\/www.ustream.tv\/dashboard, although in some instances, you may need to contact us directly.\nUpgrades will be applied retroactively to the beginning of the current billing cycle. Any usage in the current billing cycle will be charged under the new plan rates. At the time you choose to upgrade, you will be charged the difference between your old plan rate and the new plan rate. Your billing date will remain the same as your original billing date.\nDowngrades will not take effect until the commencement of the next billing cycle. On your next billing date, you will be charged (if at all) under the new plan rates. You will not be refunded for any unused portion of the current billing cycle. Downgrading your plan may cause loss of features or functionality. Ustream will not be liable to you or any third party for any downgrading and Ustream will have no obligation to maintain any information stored in our data centers related to your account or to forward any information to you or any third party.\nGrant of License; Intellectual Property Rights.\n“Content” means, collectively, the text, data, graphics, images, logos, trademarks, photos and video files, organization, compilation and overall look and feel of Ustream’s offerings made available by Ustream through the Subscription Software and Related Services, but excluding User Submissions. “User Submissions” means, collectively, the text, data, graphics, images, photos and video files and other content and information which Ustream members or our other third-party licensors stream, post, upload and otherwise submit to the Subscription Software and Related Services, including without limitation in broadcast chats, discussion groups, message boards and Ustream member-created profile pages.

(“Ustream”, “we” or “us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our website accessible at www.ustream.tv (the “Site”) and our proprietary video player platform which enables the sharing of live and recorded video and audio content and chat on the Internet and via computers and mobile devices by our users (any and all of the foregoing (the “Services”). The Services include Ustream’s proprietary embeddable video players, the Ustream channels, our software applications (including any updates, new versions or new releases thereof) including, but not limited to, our viewer, broadcaster and recorder applications.\n\nAs used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within the United States or internationally.\n\nInformation Collection and Use\nOur primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, features and content, to administer your membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. We also may also use your information in order to better understand how our Services are used.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information.\n\nIn the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.\nPlease be aware that when you register to become a Ustream Member, other users of the Services may be able to see your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post to the Site or submit via the Services. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you. If your use of the Services violates or potentially violates Ustream’s Acceptable Use Policy, your Personal Information may be shared with law enforcement and other third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to all applicable laws.\nWe also collect the other information that you provide as part of your use of the Services, including via your registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation zip code, gender, age and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Ustream Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used.\nWe also use your Personal Information to contact you with Ustream newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. Ustream Members who agree to the terms and conditions of the Ustream Terms of Service Agreement are given the opportunity to opt-in to receiving such communications from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)\nUstream will also share and use your Personal Information with Ustream Asia, and other networks, websites and entities affiliated, owned, controlled and\/or connected with Ustream. We will use your Personal Information in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nAt times, we may offer special access to pay-per-view or other special promotional events (e.g., live broadcast of concerts), and we may share your Personal Information with those entities and advertisers that are participating in such event. Unless otherwise stated, we will only share your name and email address to the such parties, so you may receive newsletters or promotional materials from such entities.\nSurveys and Promotions. From time to time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a “Promotion”) via our Services. If you participate in a Promotion we will request certain Personal Information from you. We use the Personal Information you provide to us in these instances to administer your participation in the Promotion. Participation in a Promotion is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.\n\nLog Data. As you use the Services, whether as a Ustream Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “Ustream User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This log data may include information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.\n\nCookies\nLike many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your encrypted registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site as well as display preference settings (such as preferred language). Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Ustream Users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.\n\nWe may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “Pixel Tags”) in connection with our Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.\n\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\nUstream Members. When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, Ustream Users will see your “Screen Name” and the month and year you first registered with Ustream (“Required Member Identifiers”). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (“Other Member Information”) and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information publicly on the Site by making selections via the “user preferences” section of your profile webpage. Providing Other Member Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Ustream Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information.\n\nNotifications and Following other Ustream Members. Ustream Members can also choose to join a “crowd” of other Ustream Members and follow their favorite Ustream broadcaster. If you choose to follow another Ustream Member, you will provide that Ustream Member with your public Ustream identity. By joining the crowd of another Ustream member, you also opt-in for notifications sent to you within the Ustream platform. You may also be followed outside of the Ustream platform, if you expose and make public your identity, email address and social network identity.\n\nAggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.\n\nService Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (each a “Service Provider”). The types of Service Providers we use include, without limitation, those that provide the following types of services: credit card processing, accounting, customer relationship management, website maintenance, notification services, database management and web analytics. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.\n\nSpotXchange. SpotXchange serves ads on the Site and through the Services and collects information about users’ interaction with those ads, as described in the SpotXchange Privacy Policy, located at http:\/\/www.spotxchange.com\/spx_privacypolicy.html.\n\nThird Party Social Networking Services. As a Ustream Member you can link your account information with certain social networking services (“SNSs”) and broadcast your activities and other data to your friends. In these instances, depending on the “user preferences” you set in your Ustream account, with your permission and on your behalf we will share the information contained in your Ustream account (e.g., Ustream profile page, channel page and any other information you deem public in any content you create on the Site) with the SNS. We also receive certain information (which may include your Personal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have set in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may share with the SNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal information a SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other online services you use.\n\nCompliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Ustream cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ustream or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.\n\nBusiness Transfers. Ustream may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. If Ustream becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice to you before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n\nChanging or Deleting Your Information\nAll Ustream Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by contacting us. If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request. See below for privacy contact information.\n\nSecurity\nUstream is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n\nWe will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.\n\nInternational Transfer\nYour information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Ustream transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.\n\nLinks to Other Sites\nThe Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through our Services. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.\n\nOur Policy Toward Children\nUstream does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at Privacy@ustream.tv If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.\n\nContacting Us\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at Privacy@ustream.tv or at:\n\nPrivacy Matters\nc\/o Ustream, Inc.\n410 Townsend Street, Ste 400\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\nI agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nATTENTION:\nPLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (\"TERMS\") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE USTREAM WEBSITE (\"SITE\"). YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY CLICKING THE \"I AGREE\" BUTTON, OR BY USING THE SITE, SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY CONTENT PROVIDED THEREIN), OR YOUR ACCOUNT, OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

I don’t think she feels anything for me as a being, particularly - I think my hands are all that truly matters to her. But should this be a problem? Certainly much less so than depending on the habit of beginning sentences with “but.” \n\nPerhaps that is the way language needs to evolve, but I can’t “stand” for it - a sensation I think I might be beginning to understand, which I certainly did not in all previous youth. It is not necessarily a rational preference. (By that I think I mean: one that I would feel confident rationalizing to you on the spot if you demanded it.) It is somewhat upsetting to find myself in this state - I can imagine it founding much of the mental activity in Western society that grows what we refer to as “hate.” \n\nIn my defense: I think my religion (right now, at least) is dignity. Somehow, this rotting, archaic, elderly process of brain mutation has led me to find beginning sentences with “but” simply unfuckingdignified.",

    "content" : "The strength of most consumer finance is that it takes 30 minutes at the shortest in terms of examination time, and it ends quickly.  If it is a simple diagnosis on the web, the result will be answered within 10 seconds. \n\nIn terms of consumer finance interest rates, it can be said that it shows the performance of loan cashing, and now customers use the comparison site and compare them well enough to borrow at low interest rates.  \n\nIt is a natural time to choose.  There are many comparison websites for each consumer finance loan, where details of interest rates that differ by company are summarized for easy comparison.\n\nSince interest points are important points, please try to compare until you are satisfied. If you search for “consumer finance reviews” for a while, you will find a huge number of sites.\n\nMany people are confused about how much they should trust.  Bank-affiliated consumer finance is said to be severely screened, and we will lend only to customers who can lend with confidence.  \n\nOn the other hand, consumer lenders who are easy to pass the examination can lend money even to customers who are slightly risky.  \n\nIf you can be sure that you can borrow money this month and repay immediately when you get the next salary, you don't have to take into account interest rates anymore.\n\nThere are fat consumer finance companies that lend without interest. Many bankers, such as consumer bankers, are now able to accept loans on the same day if the application is completed by 14:00.  \n\nBasically, it can be considered that it takes about two hours for the loan examination. \n\nIf you are a well-known consumer finance company, even if you use the same-day loan in addition to the same-day screening, the loan interest rate will be able to borrow at a low interest rate, so cash with confidence  I think you can.  \n\nBank-based consumer lenders sell their own screening criteria so that they can lend if possible, so if you fall into a bank card loan review, please apply for a bank-based consumer finance company.  What do you think. ",

    "content" : "# MacStories Tweetbot Coverage\n*Beginning on [the last page of their tweetbot tag](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/7\/).*\n\n# Tweetbot for iPhone Review\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&21919_6.jpg)\nI remember when I bought my first iPhone, Twittelator was the first Twitter client I downloaded from the App Store. Back then I wasn’t writing for MacStories, and I didn’t know about Loren Brichter’s Tweetie. I used Twittelator for months: it was a great app that had everything I needed. I saw no point in switching to another application, let alone start browsing the App Store looking for alternatives. Twitter was a young platform in the middle of expansion with lots of downtime issues, there were no lists or location features and the concept of “retweets” was just taking off thanks to the initiative of some users not affiliated with Twitter at all. For what I had to do, Twittelator was fine. Then I started MacStories, and the hunt for more compelling, alternative, different Twitter apps began.\n\nTwitterrific came after Twittelator for me. I used it for a couple of months and then finally purchased Tweetie – which had seen a terrific rise in popularity thanks to an elegant UI design, a fast engine and a simple, yet powerful set of features. I fell in love with Tweetie: it was stable, fast, intuitive, continually updated. It received the support [of the entire Apple community](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/apoltix\/3614598843\/), and it quickly became a standard among iPhone geeks to have Tweetie on a device’s homescreen. The rest is history: Tweetie 2 shipped and revolutionized the ecosystem with pull to refresh, gestures, a refreshed interface and, overall, the richest feature set available on the market. In the meantime, Twitter as a platform was growing to accommodate more users, more servers and – as a side effect to media starting to use the service to deliver news – more responsibilities. Without going back through all the changes that happened at Twitter HQ between 2009 and 2010, you might remember when the company announced [they were buying Loren Brichter’s Tweetie](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-acquires-tweetie-becomes-twitter-for-iphone-soon-free-in-the-app-store\/) and putting him in the position of lead mobile developer. Twitter rebranded the app as “Twitter for iPhone”, Tweetie 2 for Mac disappeared from our radars to eventually [come back as Twitter for Mac](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/twitter-for-mac-review-love-it-hate-it-tweet-it\/). Twitter as a *company* has changed (so much that they don’t even want [too many unofficial clients anymore](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/) ), but the core concept of the *service* stays the same: it’s all about sharing content in real time. That hasn’t changed at all. If anything, it got better.\n\nThis is why I’m looking back at the 2008 - 2010 period with a bit of nostalgia mixed with excitement for what’s next: the developer community has always driven Twitter’s innovation on mobile platforms. Twittelator, Twitterrific, Birdbrain, Tweetie, Osfoora, Tweet Library: these are some of the great apps that have changed the way we check on Twitter with our iPhones and iPads, and have created new uses and interfaces for a service that was initially meant for sharing short status messages. You can’t say this for many companies nowadays, but third-party developers have been the greatest contribution to Twitter in the past three years.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, there’s the personal aspect of the story. As Twitter was growing in 2009 and 2010, so was this website. Of course I’m not trying to compare Twitter’s growth to MacStories’ one – that would be silly – but I’m saying *I was there* when all those clients started coming out in the App Store, when Tweetie 2.0 was released, when Twitter launched [its criticized iPad app](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twitter-for-ipad-review\/). Those are pretty big milestones in the history of technology, moments of innovation that a bad ranking on Google Search can’t take away from us. I have installed dozens of Twitter apps, I have seen developers struggling to come up with the right features at the right time, or the best design to appeal new users in a market that was getting crowded very quickly. And you know, there are actual people behind the indie Twitter apps we usually cover – not faceless companies looking for easy funding and a solid exit strategy. From a blogger’s perspective, the adoption of Twitter clients and the rise of Twitter as a real time communication service are quite possibly the most notable changes that happened in the tech scene in the recent years.\n\nBut as the timestamps on our tweets teach us, stuff in the real-time world gets old in a matter of minutes. And when something gets old and fails at keeping our attention span active, it’s time to make room for the new. But make no mistake: if there’s anything I’ve learned from iOS developers, it’s that innovation doesn’t stem from a “New & Noteworthy” label in the App Store. Shipping a new product isn’t a proxy for innovation. It takes a lot of ideas, willingness to change the rules and, most of all, a real “leap of faith” to release something you’re not sure it’s ever going to catch on, but you feel in your heart and tired coding fingers was worth the effort.\n\nInnovation comes from the stubborns that don’t accept what’s been given to them.\n\n::Innovation is a big word when it comes to Twitter clients.:: The market has been saturated by thousands of copycats that don’t add any new functionality to Twitter as a platform or service for iOS devices; the official applications are generally fine for average users who are looking for a way to tweet from their iPhones and iPads and Macs. Being an innovator in the mobile Twitter scene today means being able to disrupt what’s already available. I can understand why that could be a risk not so many devs are willing to take, especially considering Twitter’s aforementioned update regarding third-party clients. It’s a tough call.\n\nYou may be wondering why I’ve already written 900 words to introduce you to the latest application from [Tapbots](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/), makers of App Store hits like Pastebot and Convertbot. I mean, it’s not a secret that I’ve been testing [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) over the past months and that Mark Jardine and Paul Haddad were working on a Twitter app for iPhone. But I believe sometimes a proper introduction is needed, just like a beautiful landscape needs to be admired and examined before a shot. In the case of Twitter clients, looking back at the platform’s history is necessary.\n\nInnovation is a risk. True excellence, on the other hand, is exclusive to those who took risks in the past and know what they’re facing now, when a new risk comes forward.\n\nTweetbot is the app I’ve been waiting for: an excellent innovator of the Twitter platform. My new favorite Twitter client.\n\nThere’s a lot to do in [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), and several features to talk about. After months of development and testing in a private beta group, Tapbots has managed to release the most complete and functional Twitter client currently available on the App Store – a powerful application that is Tapbots’ take on the whole Twitter experience. You can think of Tweetbot as Pastebot applied to your timeline: a beautiful app that shines on the Retina Display thanks to Mark Jardine’s usual attention to pixels and taste, combined with a set of functionalities and new ideas that make Tweetbot the most innovative and disruptive Twitter app for iOS I’ve seen since Tweetie 2 came out years ago. I’m not afraid to call Tweetbot the “best Twitter client available for iPhone”, as in these weeks spent testing it I’ve noticed a clear improvement in the way I can access and read Twitter from my iPhone, as well as being able to get actual work done on it.\n\n## Settings\nSo let’s start from the main screen. Tweetbot allows you to set up multiple Twitter accounts, and switch between them from the same page – which also contains a Settings tab to customize your Tweetbot experience and the various sharing options implemented by Tapbots. Adding a new Twitter account doesn’t take you to an embedded Twitter web view, you just have to enter your username and password and wait for the app to authenticate you. One little touch I’m sure a very few people have noticed so far: if you enter the wrong username or password, the login popup will “fall” off screen. Try it. It’s this attention to detail that make Tweetbot a great app.\n\nThe Settings are organized in General preferences that apply to every section of the app, and account-specific settings that you can tweak and customize for each account you’ve added in Tweetbot. I want to start from the Settings as I believe Tapbots has nailed this aspect of the app by providing many options that enable you to deeply personalize the experience, and make your Tweetbot different from someone else’s – especially when it comes to touch gestures and sound effects. First off, Tweetbot can post tweets in the background: if you leave this preference set to “off”, Tweetbot’s new tweet window will stay on screen until a tweet is posted. But if you activate it, you’ll be able to instantly return to the timeline or whatever window you’re in after you’ve pressed the Send button. What’s the benefit? Simple: when you’re uploading media like videos and photos, the posting process might take a while. With background posting, Tweetbot gets out of the way, does its job in the background so you can keep interacting with the app while a tweet is being processed. Other options in the General settings include sounds, font size, display name, and triple tap preferences.\n\nSo here’s what Tweetbot is doing to be the “innovative client” I described above: instead of simply relying on graphics to visually communicate the status of the timeline and your interactions with tweets and users, Tweetbot makes great use of sound effects to let you know when a tweet has been posted, when new ones have arrived, or when you’ve successfully retweeted something. It may sound strange at first, but sounds add a whole new layer to Tweetbot – think of [Pastebot’s](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/pastebot\/) sound notifications for copy and paste actions and you get the basic idea. Yet in Tweetbot almost everything was given a proper sound effect, and quality is top notch. In the sound settings, you’re given the option to choose whether you want effects for all actions, notifications only, or nothing. Why are sound effects such a big deal? Because I’ve found myself instantly recognizing what was going on in the app without even looking. I can scroll my timeline, hit retweet on something, keep scrolling and a few seconds later hear a sound effect and think “Hey, that retweet went through.” Again: it’s all about the details, and rethinking interaction schemes to innovate a platform that’s been stagnant for too long.\n\nI appreciate the fact that you can set font sizes and display users as real names, but I want to focus on tap actions. Like in Twitterrific for iOS, you can perform a triple tap on a tweet to *do something*. In Tweetbot, you can configure this triple tap to mark a tweet as favorite, initiate a reply, retweet, or translate. I keep mine set to “mark as favorite”, and I love it.\n\nLast, there are the account settings. In this window you can basically select all the additional services you want to use with your Twitter account, and Tweetbot has a great selection of URL shorteners, image \/ video upload websites and read later services to choose from. Instapaper and Read It Later are supported, but there’s no Readability integration yet. For video upload, you can choose between Mobypicture, TwitVid and yfrog. Mobypicture and yfrog also work as image services, with the addition of img.ly (which I use), Plixi, Twitgoo and TwitPic. In the URL shortening section, you can log in with your CloudApp account (my favorite), bit.ly (no authentication), goo.gl, is.gd, j.mp, Linkyy, l.pr and TinyURL. If you select a URL shortening service, all the links you post in Tweetbot will be automatically shortened.\n\nAnd that’s it for the Settings. Like I said Tapbots worked really hard to get as many options as possible out in the first version, and expect more coming in future updates. Right now, these settings help a lot in customizing how Tweetbot works for you, but it’s when you get to the app’s timeline that you notice why Tweetbot is, indeed, different.\n\nLet me get back to the subject of taking risks for a minute: how do you break the rules and conventions in a Twitter client for iPhone, a well-established category that hasn’t seen real innovations since the inception of swipe actions and pull to refresh? By **building on** those innovations, and trying to come up with something new that can “fix” the issues many people had with Twitter apps in the past. At the same time, you have to make sure your product is still accessible and easy to use, because new features added for the sake of being original at all costs can turn out to a terrible idea. This was the risk – the challenge Tapbots had to accept. And with the final product in our hands today, I have to admit the Twitter experience offered by Tweetbot is perfect. At least for me, I haven’t seen any other app that’s so well executed, beautiful, fast and useful for what I have to do with Twitter.\n\n## Timeline & Actions\nTweetbot’s timeline is based on three key features: lists, gestures, and actions. Together with these features, there are dozens of additional touches like pull to refresh, timeline resume and customizable tabs that are the proverbial icing on the cake. In Tweetbot, any Twitter list can become your main timeline in two taps. With a button in top toolbar that separates the “back” and “new tweet” buttons, you can access all your private \/ public lists you’ve created or subscribed to and make them a timeline that will replace the people you follow until you select the main Timeline again. Let’s say I want to temporarily switch to a timeline based on a list collecting people that tweet about RIM: I tap on the timeline button, select the list, and there my main timeline is replaced by the RIM folks. I can go back at any time, choose lists – even create new ones and add users to them thanks to Tweetbot’s full list management. Other Twitter clients in the past tried to play around with this concept of turning lists into timelines, but none of them got close to today’s implementation in Tweetbot. It’s simple, fun, and adds value to my productivity.\n\nThe timeline is organized in tabs: people you follow, replies, direct messages, and two customizable tabs. Instead of putting a tab for favorite tweets and then an obscure “More” tab to let you navigate between other sections like most Twitter clients do nowadays, Tapbots created a system that allows you to access **4 sections using 2 tabs**. Once you try it, it’s genius: the last two tabs in the bottom bar have little arrows next to the main icon, which means these tabs can be “expanded” to reveal more sections. So let’s say Tweetbot defaults my fourth tab to Favorites but I want to put Lists in there, all I have to do is tap & hold the tab, and choose lists (or the third item, retweets). It’s a tiny, translucent menu that contains icons for the additional sections you might want to open and – guess what – it’s got its own sound effect as well. In my opinion, this is incredibly better than having a More tab [to manually customize the contents of the tab bar](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/iphone-tab-bar-lessons\/) – Tweetbot has 5 tabs, but they’re virtually 9. Also, the selected tab has a pressed state, and a blue highlight to indicate new tweets or direct messages. It looks great, it works equally well. Direct messages can be marked as read with a double tap, and they’re presented in threaded conversation views. Thumbs up.\n\nTo quickly scroll to the top of the timeline, you can tap on the iOS status bar as you would expect from any iPhone app. But as you do that, you might notice something different about Tweetbot’s timeline. First, there’s a search field above the first tweet that enables you to filter down status updates based on specific keywords. If you keep scrolling up, you will stumble upon Tweetbot’s version of the mythical pull to refresh gesture: it’s got a spinning blue indicator that visually tells you what’s going on, and a timestamp with the last time you’ve refreshed the timeline. When the timeline is successfully updated, Tweetbot plays a “ping” sound but doesn’t automatically scroll to the top: instead, it places a blue bar between the last tweet you read and the newly fetched ones telling you how many new tweets you have. Swipe up, and there you have some new tweets to read – refresh again, and the previous bar goes away making room for a new one indicating new tweets. It’s a lot simpler than it sounds from a written review. Combine pull to refresh and the “new tweets” inline notification with Tweetbot’s perfect resume function and you get the idea of why I love this app so much. You know when you leave Twitter for a few hours and you come back to find hundreds of new tweets, right? To me, that usually happens in the morning when I wake up and fire up Twitter for Mac. Now, in most Twitter apps for iOS the action of loading past tweets isn’t well implemented at all: you have to manually scroll to the bottom, and keep scrolling until an API limit is reached and the app can’t get any more tweets. In Tweetbot, you get a visual “break” between recent tweets and past ones in the form of an empty dark grey bar with a + icon in the middle. When you tap on that, the app begins loading tweets, “opens” the timeline with a cool animation and puts loaded tweets in there. Your position is maintained, and the process takes seconds even on 3G. In my tests, Tweetbot has always been reliable at keeping my exact position in the timeline even after days, and it always loaded new \/ past tweets correctly. For work purposes, this is simply great: I don’t lose my position in the timeline, and I don’t lose tweets. It’s a win-win feature.\n\nThe best thing about Tweetbot, however, isn’t the timeline itself: it’s how you can do stuff with tweets that impressed me since the first beta I installed on my iPhone. It’s how you can perform actions on tweets easily, quickly, with just a few gestures or taps without being forced to leave the timeline at all. And when you *do need* to leave the timeline to open another view that can’t be displayed inline (for obvious reasons), Tweetbot makes sure you get there with ease. Everything in Tweetbot is intuitive. A big feature of version 1.0 is support for gestures: you can swipe right on a tweet to view a conversation, or swipe left to view “related tweets” – namely, all replies to the author. These features are useful and fun to use for three reasons: they have their own sound effects and indicators next to the main tweet; they’re fast; they’re so addictive you’ll wonder why didn’t anyone else think of them before. Ever since I started using Tweetbot, I tried to go back to other clients and I immediately missed Tweetbot’s quick way of displaying a conversation with a single swipe. This is a functionality you can’t understand from the screenshots – you have to try it and let it grow on you.\n\nAnd then there’s the **action drawer**. This is hands-down my favorite feature of Tweetbot and the one that’s helping me save a lot of time when dealing with tweets related to MacStories or material I want to write about. It works like this: tap on a tweet, and the timeline collapses to reveal a drawer “beneath” a message. This action panel contains buttons to reply, retweet, mark as favorite, open the detail view for a tweet or “do stuff.” The gear button, in fact, allows you to send to a read later service, post a link to the tweet, copy an entire tweet, email it or translate it. The “copy tweet” functionality is the one that I’ve been using the most over the past months, as it enables me to copy tweets from the @macstoriesnet account and re-post them as they are. To dismiss the action drawer, tap again on the tweet. Why is Tweetbot’s action drawer any better than Twitter’s swipe-to-reveal menu? First, it doesn’t hide a tweet and it’s unobtrusive in the way it shows up on your timeline. More importantly, it contains functionalities that several clients only let you access from a “sharing” button in the tweet detail view, which in Tweetbot is entirely optional and doesn’t need to be opened. These actions can also be activated with a tap: tap & hold on a link to send to Instapaper, tweet the URL or open in Safari; tap on a link (while the action drawer is open) to view it in the built-in web view. On the other hand, if you tap & hold on a tweet you’ll get the same options from the gear button. But there’s more: tap&hold on a profile pic to check on follow status, unfollow, add to list, DM and report for spam; double tap to open a user’s profile. This view gives you all the information you need about a user: location and website (both tappable), picture, bio, followers, following count and lists. You can block users within Tweetbot, if you want. You can also view everyone’s tweets, replies, favorites and lists without leaving the app. Furthermore, the “find people” feature in the Search tab lets you find users and follow them with literally two taps. Of course, you can browse trends, interests and saved searches, too.\n\nLast, there’s the tweet compose window. Tapbots went for a minimal approach here, with a simple design focused on letting you get a tweet out as fast as possible. However, there are many options behind the curtain: you can save and attach drafts (I love this); switch accounts with a single tap thanks to the user button at the top; you can upload photos or videos or – here comes one of the many big features of Tweetbot – remove the location the app automatically gets for you and choose coordinates or points of interests instead.\n\n## Wrap-up\nThere’s a lot to do in Tweetbot, and many little design touches and interactions I haven’t mentioned. Like the way the app displays retweets, Boxcar integration, or the blue drawer that comes down from the status bar after you’ve posted a new tweet. They play an important role in the app, but they’re all part of a much sophisticated plan when you look at the big picture. Tweetbot comes from developers who decided they wanted to make the perfect Twitter client with a beautiful user interface, an amazing feature set, and an innovative approach to timelines. That’s what I call a *risk*. A challenge that’s been in development for more than a year, a huge risk considering Twitter’s intention to undervalue “regular clients” and focus on new uses for the platform.\n\nYet, Tapbots wanted to make a better client.\n\nThey succeeded. Tweetbot is everything I’ve ever wanted from a Twitter app: it looks great, it’s fast on WiFi and 3G, it innovates in several aspects that have been regarded as “standards” from both users and developers for too long. Could Tweetbot be any better? Maybe. The developers could work on improving the speed of animations and refresh times as much as possible, or implement support for Readability and other URL shortening services. But as far as the Twitter experience goes, Tweetbot has got everything I’m looking for.\n\nSo go download it now. [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) was a risk for Tapbots, but they managed to build the best Twitter client for iPhone I’ve ever had.\n\n[Tweetbot for iPhone Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.1 Released: Landscape Mode, CloudApp, Fixes\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&22827_PTM_343_1000000714.png)\nIf you read my original [Tweetbot for iPhone review](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), you know it’s a great Twitter client I’m in love with. Over the past weeks I had the chance to try out an early version of Tweetbot 1.1, [released today in the App Store](http:\/\/cl.ly\/5zY6), and once again Tapbots has managed to fit so many features into the app it’d be hard at this point to think of anything that didn’t find its way into Tweetbot. Version 1.1 introduces the much requested support for landscape mode, but there’s a catch: considering the portrait nature of the iPhone, landscape only works in three sections: compose window, for those who like to type with a larger keyboard; media, to view photos in landscape; web, to have a broader view of web pages. It makes sense to not offer landscape support in the timeline – you’d have to give up on viewing a certain amount of tweets in horizontal orientation, plus, let’s face it, it would just look weird. So landscape it is, but only for some sections of the app.\n\nTweetbot 1.1 is also rich in additions to the main experience. The app’s got new user and hashtag buttons added to the compose screen, to make it easier to include people of specific keywords in a tweet. The hashtag picker has been improved as well, if you’re into following Twitter trends, or have a set of tags you use often. More importantly, photos and videos can now be uploaded to CloudApp, meaning the service is not only being used for URL shortening anymore. In the timeline, Tapbots has fixed the location stuff to display more accurate locations and moved the “tweet gap” bar above old tweets, instead of below. I’m not sure I like the new gap bar better, but perhaps it’ll keep growing on me over the next weeks.\n\nOverall, Tweetbot 1.1 builds on the excellent foundation of version 1.0 to deliver a powerful Twitter client that’s heavily based on Tapbots’ custom style, but it’s accessible for anyone who’s never used a Tapbots app before. The app is propagating now in the App Store, so check for updates in iTunes in a few minutes if it isn’t out for you yet.\n\n[Tweetbot 1.1 Released: Landscape Mode, CloudApp, Fixes](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-1-released-landscape-mode-cloudapp-fixes\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.2 Released With Several Enhancements\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&23900_Photo-09-6-11-19-13-53.jpg)\nTweetbot, the Twitter client from Tapbots we reviewed [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), has been updated to version 1.2, adding several features requested by users in the past weeks and fixing some of the minor gripes we had with the application when it first came out. Whilst version 1.1  [focused on adding CloudApp](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-1-released-landscape-mode-cloudapp-fixes\/) and landscape support, Tweetbot 1.2 brings a series of refinements and enhancements across all the sections of the client that should dramatically improve the experience. For example, you can now undo retweets, and retweet from another account if you hold down the retweet button. That’s quite handy: not only you can delete accidental retweets, you can also retweet quickly without constantly switching between accounts. And if you don’t like Twitter’s standard retweets, Tweetbot 1.2 has an option to send old “quote style” retweets.\n\nTweetbot 1.2 introduces absolute and relative timestamps, Google\/Instapaper Mobilizer support for when you need to strip away all the clutter from a webpage and read it in a text-only view, as well as integration with Bitly.Pro for those who keep a custom domain on the popular link shortening service. Besides the new great user & hashtag picker from the compose view (make sure to check out the animations), short link geeks should be happy to know Tweetbot 1.2 has support for custom API endpoints. Other features in this update include:\n\n* Pinboard support in the read later options\n* Pikchur image upload support\n* Tapping on a success\/failure message dismisses it instantly\n* Added @username\/listname for followed lists\n\nTweetbot 1.2 is [available now at $1.99 on the App Store](http:\/\/cl.ly\/5zY6).\n\n[Tweetbot 1.2 Released With Several Enhancements](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-2-released-with-several-enhancements\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.3 Released with New Features & Favstar Support\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&24448_IMG_8044.png)\nIt was only three weeks ago that we [covered](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-2-released-with-several-enhancements\/) Tweetbot 1.2, an update to the popular Twitter client from Tapbots that added retweet undo options, old-style retweets, Pinboard support and a new user\/hashtag picker in the compose screen. Today, another update to Tweetbot has been released, reaching version 1.3 and adding new design refinements, Twitter features, as well as general fixes aimed at improving the user experience.\n\nTweetbot 1.3 comes with a new account switcher popover that adds one extra step to go back to the account screen, but should prevent users from accidentally hitting the button when touching the top timeline bar. Tapbots received several reports of users annoyed by the fact that the button was too close to the timeline selector, and rather than removing it or replacing it altogether, they figured out a way to quickly switch accounts or go back to the accounts & settings page. It is an extra step but the trade-off should be worth it. Also improved in Tweetbot 1.3 are direct messages: you can now delete entire threads and single messages, copy them and translate them, but also enjoy a new recipient selector when composing a new DM. Obviously, Tweetbot has already been updated to include Twitter’s recent policy changes and OAuth login to use direct messages (if you haven’t re-authorized the app, do it now).\n\nAnother new feature that had me excited to check out Tweetbot 1.3 is Favstar support: for those who don’t know, [Favstar](http:\/\/favstar.fm\/) is a fantastic ego-booster service that lets you see how many people have retweeted and marked your tweets as favorite. It provides a “most recent” list, as well as an all-time chart to see your most successful 140-character messages ever. I’m addicted to Favstar, and Tweetbot now comes with handy integration to invoke the “award tweet of the day action” (tap and hold the favorite button in the tweet drawer) and open your Favstar profile (double tap your profile tab). I love this.\n\nOther changes in Tweetbot 1.3 include:\n\n* Local trends\n* “Add to List” feature improved and renamed to “Manage List Memberships”\n* Added “go to user” feature in people search (shows when typing into the “Search People” box)\n* Gaps now load above or below depending on position of gap when button is invoked.\n* Compose Tweet from hashtag (by holding down on a hashtag in a tweet)\n* Drafts button now displays # of drafts.\n\nIt’s great to see Tweetbot getting better and more powerful on each release, and you can read more about the future of the app [here](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/tweetbot\/tweetbot-1-3-and-the-state-of-push-notifications). Or, you can check out more screenshots of version 1.3 below and download the app [here](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n[Tweetbot 1.3 Released with New Features & Favstar Support](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-3-released-with-new-features-favstar-support\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Gets Initial Push Notification Support\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&24812_IMG_0091.png)\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), the Twitter client “with personality” we [reviewed](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/) a while ago and [followed](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-2-released-with-several-enhancements\/) as the developers [introduced](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-3-released-with-new-features-favstar-support\/) new features and fixes, has received a major update to version 1.4 that adds a new important functionality, highly requested by the app’s userbase: push notifications. Alongside various bug fixes, selected tabs now remembered when switching accounts, and lists from Twitter users viewable as tweets, Tweetbot 1.4 comes with a new Push Notifications service in the Settings that allows you to be notified about incoming DMs, replies, follows and unfollows, and so forth. The supported Twitter services are many, however the developers have decided to limit the rollout of push notifications for now, mentioning scaling issues and API limitations from Twitter. As Tapbots wants to ensure an optimal experience for everyone, make sure their push notification servers hold up to the new traffic (enabling push notifications for an app – especially a Twitter client – isn’t as easy as most people think) and avoid delays in notification delivery, the initial rollout of Tweetbot push notifications will allow 1,000 users to sign up on a first come, first serve basis. In the following weeks, the limit will be raised to 10,000 users. Please keep in mind that right now – the app has just started propagating in the iTunes Store – notifications might take a while to become active as Tapbots set up the new service.\n\nTapbots [explained](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/tweetbot\/push-notifications-push-notifications-push-notifications) the decision on their blog:\n\n> Yes, Tweetbot 1.4 has push, but not everyone will have access to it as soon as we launch. We need to make sure our code will properly scale. If we let everyone access the service at once, any small problem on our part may cause the servers to crash. Also, Twitter has only approved us to monitor 10,000 accounts via their site streaming service. Their service is in beta and they need to scale properly as well. We’ll be working with them over the following weeks to increase this limit.  \n\n> For launch, we are allowing around 1000 twitter accounts to access push notifications.  \n\nTo enable push notifications, and see if they’re still available to new users, head over to the app’s settings, open the Push Notifications panel and try to activate a switch. Furthermore, Tapbots has also implemented nice in-app notifications that will slide from the top of the screen to show you an incoming DM or mention without specific to the Messages or Replies tab.\n\nAnother interesting addition to Tweetbot in version 1.4 is tweet notes. Users can now attach a note to tweets using services like CloudApp, twtmore or pastebin. Push notifications are a welcome addition to Tweetbot, and we’ll keep an eye on the service as Tapbots scale their servers to accomodate more users. You can [download Tweetbot at $2.99 on the App Store](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n**Update**: In a blog [post](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/tweetbot\/ready-set-whoops), the Tapbots developers say an issue with the 1.4 build is preventing push notifications from working. An update has been already submitted to the App Store to fix the error.\n\n> The push service isn’t working in 1.4. Provisioning profile issues. Human error. We are truly sorry. We submitted a new build with a fix that will work. We’ve politely asked Apple to expedite the process so hopefully the wait won’t be too long.  \n\n**Update 7\/15**: Tweetbot 1.4.1 has been approved and it’s now available in the App Store. The new build fixes the issues with push notifications reported yesterday, allowing access to the first 1,000 users to enable them. According to Tapbots, roughly 10 minutes after the release they were already halfway through the initial 1,000 users limit. Check out a screenshot of Tweetbot’s in-app notification banner below.\n\n[Tweetbot Gets Initial Push Notification Support](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-initial-push-notification-support\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.5: Muting is Forever\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&25644_MuteThatPaul.png)\n\nWell, it’s finally here. You asked for it — you wagged your finger about it — you hate the people you follow on Twitter so much that you don’t want to hear another peep out of them, yet deep down you don’t really want to get in one of those uncomfortable, “Why did you unfollow me!?” moments. Or maybe someone’s had a little too much caffeine and you just need a break. With Tweetbot 1.5, you can mute those pesky over-tweeters and keep meme-esque hashtags from cluttering your timeline. Although I hear there’s a self desctruction mechanism built in if you ever mute .\n\nMuting! It’s like the unfollow no-one else but you has to know about. Let’s look at Tapbot_Paul for example: he’s been going overboard with these Google + Motorola tweets. Yeah, I could miss out on some new Tweetbot news, but I’ll take my chances and keep Paul out of my timeline for a day. Ah, peace and quiet! And if I miss the warmth of his tweeting voice, I can undo the mute at anytime.\n\nSo how does muting work? It works pretty similarly to reporting someone as spam: you hold down on that person’s avatar (or alternatively visit their profile and hit the gear button), and select the mute option. If you want to see everything you’ve muted, there’s a new button in the tab bar so you can manage everything and everyone. What about hashtags? Just hold on the hashtag, and mute that bad-boy too. Anyone who tweets with that annoying will be filtered from your timeline.\n\nSay hello to muting Zen.\n\nThere’s some additional goodies too, just in case muting wasn’t enough. You’ve been able to email direct message conversations for a while now, but what if you only want to email a single message? You were once able to tap on a direct message and only get options to translate and copy the tweet, but now you have the additional option of emailing it off. This is great if you want to share directions, instructions, etc. without sharing the entire conversation about Godzilla vs. Mothra. I imagine this will be useful for a lot of you mobile lackeys.\n\nTalking about lackeys (this is a terrible transition — I am *so sorry* ), those engineering-crazies over at Twitter are undoing this whole short URL business with a bunch of t.co links. Every link you post on Twitter will now be shortened with Twitter’s magic shortener — if you want the “why” behind it all, read [here](https:\/\/support.twitter.com\/entries\/109623) and [here](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/blog\/next-steps-with-the-tco-link-wrapper). I’m not crazy about t.co, but other people love them. The nice thing about t.co links at least is that you won’t notice them — Twitter’s apps and Tweetbot automatically expand the URL so you can see what you’re getting into.\n\nBecause of this short URL hoopla, there might be an unhappy person or two. Tweetbot, now in full support of t.co URLs, has cut down on the shortening services provided. Everything from j.mp to TinyURL has been gutted to support only a few services (including Twitter’s own) for analytics outside of the Twitter ecosytem (bit.ly pro) or for CloudApp. In response to the, “OMG @$#! WHY would you do this!?” exclamation-exclamations, the short answer is because t.co is going to [shorten links regardless of external short URL](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/docs\/tco-link-wrapper-faq#My_application_or_users_already_use_URL_shorteners._Will_this_break_URL_shortening_and_can_my_users_opt-out) you use.\n\nWhile I sidestep the possible rage-face caused by the last dose of information, I can gladly say that Tweetbot has international hastag support! At least for Japanese, Cryllic, and Korean (I’m not sure about other languages) — Twitter rolled out a feature not long ago that would allow you to see [English Tweets written in a more familiar language](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/asia\/2011\/07\/13\/twitter-now-supports-japanese-hashtags\/), and now Tweetbot can do it too.\n\nSo that’s Tweetbot 1.5: Muting, t.co all the way, and international hashtag support ready for your grimey fingers in the App Store. Just hit the update button — it’s sitting right there (or will be soon). If you don’t have Tweetbot yet, you’re missing out: slick animations, in-app notifications, and other goodies await. A great companion to your stockpile of Twitter clients, you can grab Tweetbot [for $2.99 in the App Store](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\nP.S.: We’ve unblocked Paul. *For now*.\n\n[Tweetbot 1.5: Muting is Forever](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-5\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.6 Gets Tweet Marker Timeline Sync\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&25805_1.jpeg)\nFollowing the  [muting features and improvements](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-5\/) introduced in version 1.5, everyone’s favorite Twitter client from Tapbots, [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), has been updated to 1.6 to include timeline sync through Manton Reece’s [Tweet Marker](http:\/\/tweetmarker.net\/). For those unaware of such system, Tweet Marker is a fantastic free web service that allows developers to turn on a feature in their Twitter clients to enable timeline sync for users. Best showcased in the Iconfactory’s Twitterrific for Mac and iOS, Tweet Marker lets users effortlessly switch between apps or platforms (such as the iPad and Mac) while retaining the last-read tweet position. In Twitterrific, as we [detailed in our coverage](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/mac\/twitterrific-4-3-syncs-timeline-position-with-tweet-marker\/), Tweet Marker integration means the app can either “show the marker”, or automatically scroll to it.\n\nBecause Tweet Marker is cross-platform, your timeline position from Twitterrific (or any other app that will soon support the service) can be synced to Tweetbot, and vice versa. Tweetbot will automatically scroll to the last synced tweet in your timeline, and display a “marker” next to it. To enable Tweet Marker in Tweetbot a quick trip to the Settings is required, so you can activate “Sync” under Account Settings -> Services. Furthermore, Tweetbot syncs mentions and lists as well through Tweet Marker, so future applications that will integrate this technology will have the opportunity to get further syncing besides the main timeline. As usual, Tweet Marker’s sync is invisible, and fast. You won’t even notice it once it’s active, and it works really well combined with Twitterrific (which I’m a big fan of).\n\nTweetbot 1.6 also brings various improvements to username search in the compose view, which now uses your following list, and location. The latter has been refined to “stick” your location including POI across multiple tweets if you haven’t moved. It’s a nice touch.\n\nThe latest update to Tweetbot is nice, but it becomes a must-have if you’re already hooked to Tweet Marker’s usefulness and simplicity. Get it now [on the App Store at $2.99](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n[Tweetbot 1.6 Gets Tweet Marker Timeline Sync](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Gets iOS 5 Twitter Integration with Single Sign-On\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&26727_15.jpg)\niOS 5 is officially launching tomorrow, and the App Store’s review team has been busy these past few days quickly approving app updates that take advantage of the new features available to developers. A first example was OmniFocus for iOS, [updated to include the location reminders](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/omnifocus-updated-with-ios-5-location-reminders\/) Apple will make popular with its own native Reminders app. Today another popular third-party app for the iPhone, Tweetbot, has been updated to include bug fixes and a new iOS 5-only feature – Twitter integration.\n\nWhilst we’ll have a detailed overview of Twitter integration in iOS 5 tomorrow, Apple has already announced that developers will be able to use a feature called single sign-on to let their apps fetch Twitter credentials directly from the operating system, which has a new Twitter panel inside the Settings. Thanks to single sign-on, if a Twitter account (or multiple ones) are already configured in iOS 5’s Twitter settings, third-party apps like Tweetbot won’t need to re-authenticate users through a clumsy web view as they’ve been forced to do until today. They can simply get the account-related information from iOS’ Settings app.\n\nSo when you’ll install iOS 5 tomorrow, try to add your Twitter account to the iPhone’s settings – this will enable [other functionalities](http:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/features.html#twitter) that we’ll also cover tomorrow in our overview. Then install the new Tweetbot 1.7, which is already available, and you’ll notice you won’t have to re-enter your Twitter credentials again – Tweetbot will ask you if it’s okay to add the accounts already on your device. The procedure takes seconds, and is managed by an “Import iOS Accounts” option in Tweetbot’s settings. The best part is that because third-party apps are deeply integrated with Twitter in iOS 5, new accounts you’ll add through Tweetbot will also be carried over the system’s Twitter settings.\n\nThis kind of Twitter integration with the OS makes for a better first launch experience as users don’t need to go find their Twitter passwords again and re-authorize every account on each Twitter-enabled app. Tweetbot is the first popular third-party client to take advantage of this, and you [get it now on the App Store for $2.99](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n[Tweetbot Gets iOS 5 Twitter Integration with Single Sign-On](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-ios-5-twitter-integration-with-single-sign-on\/)\n\n# Tapbots Release First Ever\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&27591_Tweetbotsale.jpg)\n[Tapbots](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/), creators of awesome iPhone apps such as Calcbot, Weightbot, Pastebot, and Convertbot have decided to promote their fantastic twitter client by having a limited time sale of [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/).

You keep working on it, trying to look at your product from as many perspectives as possible. If you believe in it, you can make something great an even *greater* product. Last year, [I reviewed Tweetbot 1.0 for iPhone](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), the Twitter client many of us had been impatiently waiting for:\n\n> Tweetbot is the app I’ve been waiting for: an excellent innovator of the Twitter platform. My new favorite Twitter client.  \n\n> Tweetbot is everything I’ve ever wanted from a Twitter app: it looks great, it’s fast on WiFi and 3G, it innovates in several aspects that have been regarded as “standards” from both users and developers for too long. Could Tweetbot be any better? Maybe. The developers could work on improving the speed of animations and refresh times as much as possible, or implement support for Readability and other URL shortening services. But as far as the Twitter experience goes, Tweetbot has got everything I’m looking for.  \n\nI have tried many Twitter apps in the past years, as [you may know](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/new-twitter-clients\/), and I’ve never seen a third-party developer as committed to making their client *great* as Tapbots did with [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/). Iteration. Tapbots listened to feedback, and managed to pull the old trick of implementing features without turning your original vision into a piece a software it wasn’t meant to be. With [version 2.0 of Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), Tapbots has improved almost every aspect of the original experience, adding features, bug fixes, and refinements that still make Tweetbot the finest Twitter client available on the iPhone. Now faster, smoother, and more intuitive.\n\nAnd it’s not like we didn’t see [Tweetbot 2.0](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) coming. In the past nine months, Tapbots has brought Tweetbot from a fantastic 1.0 release to a state-of-the-art Twitter app capable of suiting all kinds of needs when interacting with Twitter in short burst of tweets, or longer sessions aimed at catching up with hours worth of timeline updates. Let’s look back at Tweetbot’s history:\n\n* Tweetbot 1.1  [brings](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-1-released-landscape-mode-cloudapp-fixes\/) landscape mode.\n* Tweetbot 1.2  [is released](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-2-released-with-several-enhancements\/) with several enhancements all around the app.\n* Tweetbot 1.3  [has new features](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-3-released-with-new-features-favstar-support\/) including Favstar support.\n* Push notifications [are added](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-initial-push-notification-support\/) natively to Tweetbot, and they are fantastic.\n* Tweetbot 1.5  [gets](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-5\/) muting features.\n* Tweetbot 1.6  [syncs](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync\/) with other Twitter clients using Tweet Marker.\n* Tweetbot is one of the first clients to [get native Twitter integration](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-ios-5-twitter-integration-with-single-sign-on\/) in iOS 5.\n\nAs you can see, Tapbots didn’t rest on its laurels, deciding to keep on building on the app’s momentum to deliver *the* Twitter client that could appeal to both power users and less tech-savvy citizens of the Twitterverse. I have already explained why Tweetbot is my Twitter client of choice: if anything, I’d like Tweetbot to take over the entire ecosystem to offer an integrated experience consistent across platforms.\n\nIt would be easy to look at Tweetbot 2.0 and say it’s everything Tweetbot 1.0 should have been without considering the various milestones and updates that brought us to this release. Think of Tweetbot 2.0 as a natural evolution of Tweetbot, rather than just a collection of features that didn’t make it in version 1.0. Tweetbot 2.0 is the culmination of nine months of fine-tuning.\n\nThe biggest change in Tweetbot 2.0 is the timeline. What used to require two taps now needs only one, and the way retweets are displayed has been improved to increase interaction and overall navigation between original posters and retweeters. In Tweetbot 1.x, opening a @username or http:\/\/ link from a tweet in the timeline required a double-tap (or an initial tap to “expand” the tweet and reveal the tweet drawer), then a second one to tap on usernames and links. In Tweetbot 2.0, you can directly single-tap on links and usernames (which are a bit bolder than other words) without opening the drawer; you can always reveal more options by tapping somewhere else on the tweet, but this time single taps on usernames and links will open a user’s profile view or a web view, respectively. Similarly, single-tapping on profile pics in the timeline will take you to the profile view, whereas in Tweetbot 1.x this action would open the tweet drawer. Without sacrificing performances in any way (actually, Tweetbot 2.0 with its new tap actions and timeline UI feels faster than Tweetbot 1.x on my iPhone 4S – both in terms of scrolling, swiping, and image caching), Tweetbot’s improved tap behavior is more than a welcome change – it’s a terrific improvement over the previous version’s navigation system.\n\nLinks and usernames aren’t the only things you can now tap on – retweets, displayed natively in Tweetbot, have been redesigned to allow users to tap and tap & hold on the name of the user that retweeted a status update; furthermore, the entire retweet UI has been tweaked to integrate the “Retweeted by …” indicator inside the message cell – take a look the screenshot below for comparison. If the people you follow often retweet stuff, this is another great improvement as it enables you to easily check the user who retweeted something you like.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&iPhone-1.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&iphone-2.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&iphone-newbar.png)\nAs you scroll Tweetbot’s new timeline, you’ll notice that another addition has found its way in this update: image thumbnails. How many times have you looked at Instagram links (or any picture link) and wondered if it’d be appropriate to open it, or if you’d be interested in it? Fear no more, as Tweetbot now displays thumbnails inline and allows you to tap on them to jump straight to the image viewer in full-screen. The image viewer itself is the same of Tweetbot 1.0; by tapping & holding the thumbnail, however, you’re given some handy options such as Send to Instapaper (which becomes Pinboard or Read It Later depending on the service you’ve configured in Settings), Tweet URL, Open in Safari, Copy URL, and Email URL. Even with thumbnails, scrolling in Tweetbot’s new timeline is smooth and fast.\n\nBut there’s more. Remember the “new tweets bar” from the original Tweetbot, the blue stripe that let you know how many new tweets you had in your timeline and loaded differently depending on gap behavior? It’s gone. Instead, Tweetbot 2.0 features a new beautiful translucent tweets bar that works the same for gap loading (admittedly, still the best implementation on any iOS Twitter client) but that you can also hide on scroll or make persistent as you swipe down to reach the top of your timeline. Why is the new tweets bar useful? It provides a nice-looking and unobtrusive way of knowing how many tweets you still have to read – at least for me, this is **very** useful when I’m opening Twitter after hours of inactivity.\n\nAnd then there are a lot of little changes and minor fixes. Overall performance, as I said, has been improved, making Tweetbot faster than ever and smoother in any kind of animation. Perhaps this will convince those who said Tweetbot was “heavy” that it’s worth trying the app again. Even when the new tweets bar isn’t hidden, you can tap on it to dismiss it. You can tap & hold on the gear icon in the tweet drawer to reveal two extra actions: Post Link to Tweet and View in Favstar, with Copy Link to Tweet now assigned to a single tap on the gear icon. Links in users’ profiles are tappable and the visual Tweet Marker indicator is now always visible regardless of whether you’ve activated the service or not (obviously, you’ll have to turn it on to sync to other clients).\n\nI can go on with changes and enhancements. Direct Messages have been completely redesigned to load faster and have conversations displayed from top to bottom as in Messages.app. To reply to a DM in a conversation, Tapbots has brought a Messages-like text entry field to the DM view, which now also happens to refresh every 5 minutes as part of the timed auto-refresh feature that also works for Timeline and Mentions. In Tweetbot 2.0, when a DM fails the app will make it red, allowing you to tap on it to resend or delete. Readability has been added as a mobilizer service, and there is now a toggle in every web view to instantly switch between full site and mobilized view. I love this feature (but I use Instapaper for that). Oh, and *one more thing*: don’t forget Tweetbot supports a variety of URL schemes, [more than you know](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme), and they work very well with [Launch Center](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/launch-center-1-2-gets-all-new-app-detection\/).\n\n[Tweetbot 1.0](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) was packed with [features](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/tweetbot\/tweetbot-2-0-for-iphone), proving that Tapbots could make their distinctive style work in the saturated market of Twitter clients. Updates to Tweetbot 1.0 built on the original vision, adding new powerful features and interactions that allowed Tapbots to reach an even larger audience, especially since the addition of native push notifications. Tweetbot 2.0 accomplishes the difficult goal of dramatically enhancing Tweetbot 1.0 while keeping everything familiar and accessible, proving that Tapbots can still make the best Twitter client around.\n\nTweetbot 2.0 is [now available on the App Store at $2.99](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n[Tweetbot 2.0 Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-0-review\/)\n\n# More Tweetbot\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&28412_Screen-Shot-2012-02-08-at-10.18.14-PM.png)\nWith the launch of Tweetbot 2.0 for iPhone and [Tweetbot for iPad](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/ipad\/), the team at Tapbots has once again set new standards for Twitter clients on iOS. We have taken [separate](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-0-review\/) [looks](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/) at the two apps, but you can also check out other in-depth reviews at [The Next Web](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apps\/2012\/02\/08\/tweetbot-for-ipad-enhances-the-classic-twitter-experience-with-a-speedy-gesture-focused-interface\/), [iMore](http:\/\/www.imore.com\/2012\/02\/08\/tweetbot-ipad-review\/), and [Wind on a Leaf](http:\/\/blog.windonaleaf.net\/post\/17275820500\/tweetbot-2-review-iphone-ipad). David Chartier makes a good point:\n\n> Speaking of lists, Tweetbot is one of the few clients I’ve used that truly integrates Twitter lists and makes them useful.  \n\nAs for the iPad app’s launch, the app is currently #5 in the Top Paid iPad Apps chart, up from #9 only a few minutes ago. Tapbots has already [confirmed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/167349406859919360) this is the fastest growing launch of their apps ever:\n\n> Tweetbot for iPad is the at #20 in the Top Paid iPad apps. That’s faster than we’ve ever gone on the iPhone side of things.  \n\nThe Next Web’s Matthew Panzarino [has published a great interview](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apple\/2012\/02\/08\/tapbots-founder-on-tweetbot-for-ipad-state-of-the-app-store-and-googles-app-problem\/) with Tapbots’ Paul Haddad. I particularly liked this bit:\n\n> I think the biggest problem is that Google chooses to develop iOS apps using web technologies. This might work well on Android but it just makes for a crappy feel on iOS. If you want people to use and love your apps on iOS they should be tailored for iOS and should feel like an iOS app. You can’t just hack together some cross-platform Javascript and HTML and expect it not to feel like something that was hacked together.  \n\n> On top of this they are an engineering focused company without a great history of design. This works really well on the Web where you just want to go in, search for some results and get out. But on an iPhone the interaction is much more intimate, people want something that looks and feels just right, the front end is more important than the back end.  \n\nLast, make sure to check out Rene Ritchie’s fantastic side-by-side comparison of Tweetbot, Twitter for iPad, and Twitterrific [over at iMore](http:\/\/www.imore.com\/2012\/02\/08\/tweebot-twitterrific-twitter-ipad-twitter-app-shootout\/).

[Tweetbot for iPad](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/ipad\/) is the better Twitter app I have been waiting for, and it sets a new standard that future Twitter clients will have to be compared with.\n\nFrom a Twitter power user’s perspective, the iPad came at an interesting point in the history of the platform. Twitter clients for iPhone and Mac had reached a kind of maturity and complexity that enabled users like me to demand a certain grade of efficiency from new Twitter apps for the tablet; Twitter itself was beefing up its first-party app portfolio with acquisitions and a fresh strategy based on making the official clients the go-to apps for the average Twitter user. Some notable Twitter clients came out on the iPad throughout 2010, including the excellent Twitterrific, which  [we have reviewed](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/twitterrific\/) several times on MacStories.\n\nIn 2010, Twitter also released its very own application for the iPad; developed by Loren Brichter, the man behind Tweetie, Twitter for iPad launched to a (still ongoing) controversy as to whether iPad interfaces should adopt more courageous designs in displaying information and sections to the user. Taking the best features of Twitter for iPhone (fluidity, clean design, pull to refresh) and mixing them up with  [new interaction schemes](http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2010\/09\/twitter-for-ipad-sharing-content-in.html) such as panels and pinch gestures, Twitter for iPad collected rave reviews and considerable disapprovals because of its interesting use of classic Twitter elements (vertical timeline, separate section for Mentions) alongside a new model for driving users’ taps around the app in the form of sliding panels, modal menus, and popovers. You can read more about it in  [my original review](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twitter-for-ipad-review\/) from 2010.\n\nThe problem with Twitter for iPad, I believe, is that it failed to appeal power users in the long term, stalling on the same feature set it had at launch without adding substantial improvement over what could have been a fantastic application. I, for one, used the official Twitter iPad app for months, but then I came at a point where I couldn’t stand seeing decent third-party apps staying on top of new Twitter functionalities and “unofficial” services, and Twitter’s own app left behind with Brichter [gone](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/11\/04\/loren-brichter-creator-of-official-twitter-apps-for-mac-and-iphone-leaves-twitter\/) and seemingly no interest from Twitter’s mobile team in keeping it up to date – fixing the bugs and annoyances that were reported on day one. Some  [improvements](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-updates-ios-app-with-ipad-2-camera-support-more-bug-fixes\/) and  [new features](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-updates-ios-app-with-ios-5-twitter-integration-new-ipad-dm-interface\/) eventually found their way to the app, and word is that we are waiting for a major 4.0 redesign of the client which, I believe, will put the app on par with the disastrous  [iPhone version](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/review-twitter-4-0-for-iphone\/). Tweetbot for iPad thus arrives in a landscape with no clear leader, but with some very good apps that have caught the attention of both power and average users in the past two years.\n\nI wrote about this  [before](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/new-twitter-clients\/). I wish third-party developers would accept Tweetbot as the de-facto app for power users and move on to innovate on other areas of the service. I’m biased: I love Tweetbot, I use it every day on the iPhone, and I couldn’t wait for an iPad version to be released. Today is kind of a dream come true for a Twitter nerd, but the question is – was it worth the wait? Not just good – is Tweetbot the  *great* app the iPad was waiting for? Let’s dive in.\n\nLong story short: yes, it is. Tweetbot for iPad is an amazingly advanced and full-featured Twitter client that, in spite of its 1.0 version number, already sports a series of features most apps don’t have. It’s got Tapbots’ distinctive design style applied to every aspect of the interface, and whilst some may quickly dismiss it as a non-native, Android-like look, I think it’s beautiful. More importantly, Tweetbot comes to the iPad not to single-handedly reinvent Twitter clients and the entire Twitter ecosystem, but to provide a delightful experience optimized for the bigger screen.\n\nThat’s not to say Tweetbot for iPad is a blown-up version of its iPhone counterpart – you’d be mistaken in thinking Tapbots simply took Tweetbot for iPhone and made its graphics bigger to fit the iPad. The two Tweetbots look similar to each other – some of interface elements are used consistently across both devices – but the experience offered by Tweetbot for iPad is uniquely built for a device that’s swiped, touched, and held in a different way than an iPhone.\n\nThose who use Tweetbot for iPhone will be instantly familiar with Tweetbot for iPad. In fact, I don’t think it’s necessary to go through the feature set of the app again as Tapbots managed to incorporate the same functionalities across the two platforms very cleverly:  *what* the app does is the same,  *how* it does it is different. I want to focus on how Tweetbot for iPad takes advantage of the features built by Tapbots to deliver the best Twitter experience on the iPad yet, rather than explain once again how you can turn a list into a timeline, or  [iOS 5 Twitter integration](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-5-twitter-integration\/). From a feature checklist standpoint, Tweetbot for iPad bears great resemblance to Tweetbot 2.0 for iPhone, which we have reviewed earlier today.\n\n## The Timeline\n\nLike Twitterrific for iPad, Tweetbot takes a simple approach at displaying your Twitter timeline on the tablet’s bigger screen. Rather than trying to break taps on usernames, mentions, or links into multiple panels that some users might find distracting, Tweetbot presents a clean, full-screen timeline design that can fit more status updates than an iPhone at once, and doesn’t try to revolutionize the concept of vertically scrolling a list of messages and clicking on links. There are tabs for the various sections of Twitter – including some new stuff that Tapbots has prepared for this new Tweetbot release – but no panels for the actual interaction with content, meaning that tweet details, webpages, and conversations will load in full-screen in a single window, not a panel sliding into view. And here’s where Tweetbot for iPad reveals one of its little design touches that manages to greatly enhance usability: because the iPad’s screen is so big, forcing users to tap on a tiny Back button to load a previous level of navigation can be cumbersome.\n\nTo solve the problem of a bigger screen with tiny navigation buttons, Tweetbot for iPad implements “smart gestures” in the same way that the iPhone version allows you to quickly load replies and conversations with a quick swipe, only adding new actions for going back one level or to the “root” of a section, such as your Mentions. Typically, when I’m sitting down with my iPad and fire up Twitter I like to explore around, engage in conversations and look up other people’s tweets. It’s not like I’m always in my timeline: I might open a link or two, load a conversation and follow a user’s profile from there – “nested views”, as they should be properly called, are frequent and they must be considered carefully from a usability standpoint as the app should always provide the user with an easily understable way to go back. Tweetbot for iPad offers three: the Back button, tabs, and swipe gestures. Let’s say you’ve opened a conversation from your timeline, a user’s profile from that conversation (double-tap on avatar), and another conversation from the profile (swipe on a reply). Now, it’s likely that you’ll want to go back to Point A (your main timeline), or Point B (the conversation). Tweetbot offers a two-finger swipe gesture to go back one level, and three-finger swipe to go back to root. These gestures work amazingly well in any context, and they performed fluidly on my iPad 2 in any possible scenario.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0474.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0466.png)\nOf course, you can also use the aforementioned tabs and Back button to navigate if you don’t feel comfortable with gestures: whilst simply tapping Back will “go back” one level, a tap & hold on the same button will go back to the root of a view; similarly, tapping a tab in the sidebar – whether it’s in portrait or landscape mode – will always go back to the root. Tweetbot for iPad introduces a new option in Navigation settings that lets you hide tabs you don’t want, so make sure to keep the ones you think you’re going to use as a way to navigate back in the timeline. As for URLs: they open in full-screen mode à la Twitterrific and feature the same options seen in Tweetbot 2.0 for iPhone, new mobilizer command included (plus, they are colored and single-tappable).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0465.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0464.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0463.png)\nFrom a web view, you can take a look at Tapbots’ custom popover menu design by tapping on the Sharing button in the upper right corner.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&timelines.png)\n*Timelines: Tweetbot for iPad (right) offers font size controls and bigger profile pictures than Twitter for iPad (left).*\n\n## Gestures\n\nBecause the iPad’s screen is so big compared to an iPhone, some areas of Tweetbot might appear to be “wasting space” when there’s nothing left to load – for instance, a conversation of only two tweets won’t even fill half of the screen in portrait mode. In testing the Tweetbot beta, I initially didn’t appreciate the choice of loading short conversations in their own dedicated view, because the rest of the window looked empty; with time though, I have developed a habit of using this empty space as a gesture area for navigation – it almost seems meant to be used that way. Otherwise, I don’t have a problem with Tweetbot using the same timeline design of the iPhone app as long as more tweets are displayed – reinventing the wheel (in this case, the timeline design) is not necessary when you just want to focus on reading status updates.\n\nTouch interaction is a distinctive trait of Tweetbot, and I’m glad Paul and Mark have kept gestures consistent across the iPhone and iPad. I’ve already mentioned swipes; here’s what you can do with taps:\n\n* Tap a tweet to open the tweet drawer;\n* Double-tap a tweet to open the Detail view;\n* Tap a user’s profile pic to open the Profile view;\n* Tap usernames to open Profile view, tap links to open Web view;\n* Tap & hold a link (or inline picture\/link in user’s Bio) to: Bookmark, Tweet URL, Open in Safari, Copy URL, or Email URL;\n* Tap & hold a tweet to: Bookmark, Copy Link to Tweet, Copy Tweet, Email Tweet, or Translate;\n* Tap & hold retweet button to retweet from a different account;\n* Tap & hold favorite button to Award Tweet of the Day;\n* Tap Actions button to: Copy Link to Tweet, Copy Tweet, Email Tweet, or Translate;\n* Tap & hold Actions button to: Post Link to Tweet, or View in Favstar;\n* Tap & hold a profile pic (or username\/retweet author) to: Public Reply, Manage List Memberships, Mute, Follow\/Unfollow;\n* Double-tap a tab to scroll to the top;\n* Double-tap Messages tab to Mark All Messages as Read;\n* Tap & hold an image to: Save Image, Copy Image, View Website, or Tweet Link;\n* Tap & hold hashtag to: New Post with Hashtag, or Mute;\n* Tap & hold the “via…” client link in Detail view to mute a specific Twitter client;\n* Tap the location button when composing a new tweet to Remove Location, Use Coordinates, select a Point of Interest, or choose a Location;\n* Double-tap the Profile tab to open a user’s Favstar page for recent tweets;\n* Last, you can configure triple-taps in Settings for: Reply, Retweet, Favorite, Translate, or View in Favstar.\n\nSupport for gestures, tap actions, and a variety of different web services is essentially the reason why Tweetbot is so highly regarded as an app for power users; Tweetbot for iPad doesn’t disappoint with a large selection of preferences and services to adjust and activate in the Settings. As on the iPhone, these options include Pinboard and Instapaper integration, support for upload services such as CloudApp and Moby, and mobilizer tools like Google and Readability. I particularly like how Tapbots figured out a way to implement  *a lot* of settings and gestures without overwhelming the user experience. Going through all my settings for a newly added account takes only a couple of minutes (you’ll find some new options in Tweetbot 2.0 and Tweetbot for iPad, like a switch to make the new tweets bar persistent or invisible on scroll), and the Welcome screen should get you up to speed on the most important gestures in no time.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0459.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0477.png)\nI should also note that a kind of gesture Twitter for iPad implemented directly on the timeline,  [pinch to reveal tweet](http:\/\/c0839932.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com\/Twitter%20for%20iPad%20-%20Pinch.png), is nowhere to be seen in Tweetbot, with Tapbots opting for more intuitive taps and swipes throughout the whole app. I think it’s a good choice.\n\n## Everything Else\n\nTweetbot is the best Twitter client I’ve ever used on the iPad for a number of reasons. I’ve already mentioned gestures, user interface design, and integration with many different services I use on a daily basis. Next on the list would certainly be fluidity and timeline gaps – two aspects I expect to find fully functional and stable in the Twitter client I want to use every day. In spite of its custom UI, I didn’t find Tweetbot for iPad to be “heavy”. Whilst some people are firmly convinced Tweetbot is a “heavy app”, I think such purported “heaviness” can be subjective in terms of visual appearance, because as far as the engine that powers scrolling and animations goes, Tweetbot is extremely snappy and fluid both on my iPhone 4S and iPad 2. The beefy A5 processor certainly helps in getting views to load quickly and a timeline with hundreds of tweets to scroll fast, and I’ll admit I haven’t tested Tweetbot on the original iPad, but I’m also fairly certain a lot of optimization was done on Tapbots’ side to make sure Tweetbot’s custom graphics wouldn’t interfere in any way with the UX.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&timeline.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0456.png)\nMy coworkers often make fun of me because I’m always on Twitter. As  [I have written elsewhere](http:\/\/ticci.org\/40000.html), Twitter has become more than a simple social network for me – it’s a *people* network that helps me connect with amazing individuals for work, discussion, or pure leisure. You see, I  **need** a Twitter client that’s capable of loading several hours of tweets with hundreds of status updates when I wake up. I need it to be fast at fetching these updates and stable at scrolling through them as I catch up with the news; I need it to be able to go back even 20 hours if I need to read older articles, and I want it to feature state-of-the-art timeline gap detection that picks up right where I left off, no matter how far in the timeline it is. Fortunately, Tweetbot nears perfection with its implementation of timeline gap that puts the competition to shame when it comes to loading past tweets while maintaining your previous position in the timeline intact. Twitter and Twitterrific never quite got gap detection rigt, and I’m glad this functionality of Tweetbot for iPhone has been ported over to the iPad. With the new tweets bar (which is dark gray on iPad), you also have a nice way to see how manu unread tweets you have  *while scrolling*.\n\nAs I said above, Tweetbot for iPad shares the same UI principles and feature set of Tweetbot for iPhone, but there are many things that are unique to it, especially in the interface design department, given the different screen real estate Tapbots had to work around. Several views aren’t simply bigger, as the timeline could suggest, they are  *different*.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&IMG_0484.png)\nTake the user profile view for example: rather than placing a single user’s stream in a tab separate from the profile page, Tapbots is integrating tweets directly below the profile with a tabbed interface. In the upper section of the view, you can check out various information such as following and followers count, bio, web link, and other data. There’s also a Follow button in the upper right corner, and the usual action icon will let you message people, mute them, or add them to a list. The profile view opens with the Tweets tab directly selected, so you’ll see a portion of a user’s tweets below the initial user info box. But as you scroll these tweets, the tabs will snap back to the top of the timeline so they will “stick” as you scroll, allowing you to easily switch between Tweets, Mentions, Favorites, and Lists. The effect is really neat, helps saving taps and precious interface space, and you should see it in action. As with the iPhone app, Tweetbot for iPad has solid list support with creation, management and deleting features built-in. You can create new lists on-device, manage users inside those lists, and subscribe to other people’s lists without leaving the app. And of course, you can make a list Tweetbot’s main timeline, which is another characteristic feature of the app iPhone users will immediately recognize.\n\n[Tweet Marker](http:\/\/tweetmarker.net\/) support, which was initially added to Tweetbot for iPhone, plays a big role in this iPad version if you own multiple iOS devices running Tweetbot, or a Mac with a Twitter client that has Tweet Marker sync. Now, the timeline position that the service saved from your iPhone’s Tweetbot will be pushed to the iPad automatically (if you activate Tweet Marker) every time you launch the app. I have tested Tweet Marker pretty heavily (I use it every day), and Tapbots’ implementation is flawless: getting the last synced position takes less than a second, and the app is capable of automatically scrolling to the last tweet you saw or mention you were about to reply to. We have covered Tweet Marker support in Tweetbot [before](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync\/), and those who were waiting for cross iPad-iPhone compatibility in Tweetbot to start using Manton Reece’s service finally have a reason to.\n\nI should probably mention that one of the things Twitter for iPad did exceptionally well in my opinion was letting you load links in a separate panel and scroll the timeline at the same time. That was one of the most controversial features of Loren Brichter’s app (animations weren’t 100% smooth and the web panel could be lost by simply switching tabs), and I liked it a lot. Tweetbot doesn’t take the crazy-innovative approach of Twitter for iPad, but I haven’t found the absence of panel-based link opening to be a problem in daily usage. I did notice, though, that I’ve been marking a lot of tweets as Favorites lately, but I’m not sure that’s related to Tweetbot.\n\nTypically, I’d mention that a new app I am reviewing is pretty great, but has some flaws in its first version – which is completely normal. With Tweetbot, however, I tried to come up with things I didn’t like in my three week period of testing – which involved several days of using only an iPad and hours spent on Twitter – but couldn’t. Honestly, there’s nothing “I don’t like” about Tweetbot, just a few things I wish 1.0 already had, and that perhaps are coming in the future. Personally, I would like to finally be able to use both Pinboard and Instapaper as bookmarking services at once, and have some kind of Evernote integration for saving tweets and links. I also think it’d be neat to have real-time streaming for tweets, iCloud sync for settings, and an option to add tweets to  [Storify](http:\/\/storify.com\/) – even though I understand the latter may be asking  *too much*. Like I said: I’m very happy with the workflow Tweetbot enables and I never found myself wishing a feature had been implemented differently.\n\n## New Twitter Clients\n\nIn my  [New Twitter Clients](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/new-twitter-clients\/) piece, I wrote:\n\n> So here’s another possible scenario. Let’s continue to diversify the offer of available Twitter clients, and settle with one app for power users. Justin doesn’t like Tweetbot, but perhaps one year from now Tweetbot will be available on more platforms with changes and tweaks that everyone will like and use on a daily basis, even Justin. Around that Twitter client for power users, I imagine a flourishing ecosystem of innovative Twitter apps that don’t simply focus on building an alternative to Tweetbot — a daunting task at this point — but provide a unique experience that can live alongside the main, full-featured client.  \n\nI’ve been using [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/ipad\/) on my iPad for three weeks now, and it’s good. More than good, it’s the  *great* Twitter client power users and those who simply didn’t like the alternatives out there were waiting for. Tweetbot doesn’t reinvent the genre and will look fairly familiar to those coming from the iPhone app; Tapbots brought the iPhone version’s highly engaging experience and powerful features to the iPad, fine-tuning the interface and interaction for the bigger screen in the process. You have to despise Tapbots’ style to not like this app, as anyone who’s been around long enough in the industry can tell that, as a Twitter client, Tweetbot is an amazing achievement for its developers, and the third-party community as whole, which has now a new standard to be compared to.\n\nTweetbot for iPad is [available today at $2.99 on the App Store](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n- [Tapbots website](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/ipad\/)\n\n- [Promo video](http:\/\/c200349.r49.cf1.rackcdn.com\/tweetbotipad_iphone.m4v)\n\n[Tweetbot for iPad Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/)\n\n# Interview: Tapbots’ Paul Haddad Talks Tweetbot for iPad Launch\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&28425_wpid-Photo-Feb-9-2012-532-PM1.jpg)\nFollowing yesterday’s release of Tweetbot 2.0 for iPhone and Tweetbot for iPad (our reviews [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-0-review\/) and [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/), more coverage [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/more-tweetbot\/) ), I was able to chat with Tapbots’ co-founder Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) about the launch of their first “real” iPad app, the reception of Tweetbot 2.0 for iPhone, and the iPad App Store.\n\nCheck out the interview below.\n\n**MCSTR**: Hi Paul, congratulations again on the launch of Tweetbot 2.0 and Tweetbot for iPad. So how did yesterday go in terms of sales? Was the launch as successful as you hoped?\n\n**PH**: Yeah I was surprised we hit #1 in the iPad App Store so fast, I was hoping we’d hit it at some point but wasn’t expecting it to happen in 8 hours. It was pretty fast – the Top Paid is a moving average over what I think is 3 days, so to do it in less than one is pretty amazing.\n\n**MCSTR**: I mean, it’s not easy for a social networking app priced at $2.99 to get the first spot over games and utilities (most of them sold at $0.99), right?\n\n**PH**: At least in the US I think the iPad market is certainly different than iPhone, not as heavily skewed towards the $.99 games\/apps.\n\n**MCSTR**: Do you think with the current number of downloads you can stay on #1 for many days?\n\n**PH**: I hope so, but don’t really have any idea. The iPad App Store is virgin territory for us so we don’t have many set expectations both in the short and long term.\n\nI will say that yesterday was our second biggest day ever in terms of revenue.\n\n**MCSTR**: Nice. I guess your biggest day ever was Tweetbot for iPhone launch? Or perhaps that Tweetbot sale you had last year?\n\n**PH**: Tweetbot for iPhone launch was the biggest day, but that was also a full day Vs more or less a half day, so who knows what will happen today.\n\n**MCSTR**: Yeah, it seems you guys are still #1 in the US Store, so that’s promising. Besides the rave reviews, how has general reception been?\n\n**PH**: Surprisingly good. It’s really hard to gauge these things pre-launch and we’re too close to the app to really get a feel for what other people will think of it. There certainly was a concern that people would dislike the idea of it being a separate app. But there have been very few complaints about that.\n\nSince it was our first large iPad app, I was also worried that people would feel our style wouldn’t translate well on the device. But again – overwhelmingly positive responses.\n\n**MCSTR**: How about Tweetbot 2.0? Obviously the iPad launch was bigger because it was a completely new app, but Tweetbot 2.0 is pretty sweet too.\n\n**PH**: It was really cool to be able to do both at the same time. I think Tweetbot 2.0 answers a lot of the criticisms folks have had with the app, while still making it feel like Tweetbot. I’m really happy that we were able to make it look and perform better at the same time.\n\n**MCSTR**: The obvious question is – now that we have two Tweetbots, will we get to see some sort of iCloud integration between them?\n\n**PH**: We don’t generally talk about future features because we don’t really know how long things will take, or even if things are possible. I will say it’s one of the things we are looking at.\n\n**MCSTR**: Sounds good. Last question: Is there anything you would have done differently in Tweetbot 1.0 for iPad?\n\n**PH**: I’m really happy with the way Tweetbot 1.0 came out. We actually have a very strong set of features planned out for the near future that will make it even cooler. But 1.0 is exactly what we wanted it to be, the best Twitter app for iPad and a solid base to grow from.\n\n[Interview: Tapbots’ Paul Haddad Talks Tweetbot for iPad Launch](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/msinterviews\/interview-tapbots-paul-haddad-talks-tweetbot-for-ipad-launch\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Gets Streaming\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&28891_IMG_0593.png)\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), Tapbots’ excellent Twitter client for iOS that we recently [reviewed](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/) for the launch of its long-awaited iPad version and [2.0 update](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-0-review\/) on the iPhone, received today support for one of the most requested functionalities by its users: streaming.\n\nAvailable today in version [2.1 of the iPad app](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), live streaming allows users to stay on top of the latest tweets thanks to Twitter’s real-time push technology that can be seen in the new Tweetbot timeline, which, when on WiFi, will constantly check for new tweets and automatically load them above your timeline position. An option is available to disable streaming in the app’s Settings, as well as a switch to enable “Pin to Top”. In my tests, Tweetbot’s new streaming feature has been extremely reliable – that is, unless Twitter itself was experiencing issues – and has enabled me to forego completely the need of manually refreshing or waiting for Tweetbot to update my timeline every few minutes. Like on Twitter for Mac, I think streaming is an invaluable tool if you’re planning on getting the most out of Twitter’s real time nature, and Tweetbot’s implementation doesn’t disappoint.\n\nWith streaming come a few other changes to make the experience of fetching and syncing tweets more pleasant. The new tweets sound, for instance, is now limited to mentions, direct messages, and tweets fetched with pull-to-refresh. The Tweet Marker service, which allows you to keep your Tweetbots (and other [supporting clients](http:\/\/tweetmarker.net\/) ) in sync, has been vastly improved. Generally, this means the process of getting your latest-seen tweet and timeline position should sync faster to the cloud and back to the app – in testing the latest Tweetbot, I can confirm Tweet Marker sync seems a little faster and more “accurate” than before.\n\nTweetbot is my favorite Twitter client on any platform, and streaming makes it a lot better from a user experience standpoint. You can get iPad update from the App Store now (the app’s graphics are also ready for the new iPad coming out later this week); version 2.1 of the iPhone app, sporting the same new features and [Camera+ 3.0 integration](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/camera-3-0-review\/), is still waiting for approval in the App Store’s queue.\n\n- [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n- [Tweetbot for iPad](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n[Tweetbot Gets Streaming](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-streaming\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Gets iCloud Sync for Timelines, DMs, and Mute Filters\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&29137_1sy.png)\nTwo months ago, I took a look at [the state of iCloud-enabled apps](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/the-state-of-icloud-enabled-apps\/) for Mac and iOS, sharing somewhat unsurprising results that showed few applications successfully were using iCloud sync across devices (not to mention *platforms* ), and that developers were frustrated for the lack of extensive documentation by Apple. In these past 60 days, very little has changed on Apple’s side – if anything, we’ve only seen more third-party developers trying to figure out ways to properly use iCloud and make it work in their apps. Tapbots, makers of Tweetbot (our reviews for [iPhone](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-0-review\/) and [iPad](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/) versions of the app), are releasing today an update to their Twitter client, which brings iCloud sync for various Twitter functionalities to the iPhone and iPad.\n\nI have been able to test iCloud sync in Tweetbot for a few weeks now, and whilst I was initially skeptical about the service, I am pleased to report that Tapbots has come up with a solid, clever system that might just convince you switch from [Tweet Marker](http:\/\/tweetmarker.net\/) – the only third-party solution to sync Twitter timelines that’s been widely adopted to date – if you’re planning to use Tweetbot as your main client.\n\niCloud sync, unlike Tweet Marker, works exclusively inside Tweetbot across its iPhone and iPad versions. You won’t be able to start iCloud sync on Tweetbot for iPhone and, say, find your timeline synced on Twitterrific. If you’re still looking for a real cross-platform syncing solution for Twitter, Tweet Marker remains your best option. If you, however, are you using the two Tweetbots as your default Twitter apps anyway and happen to be intrigued by iCloud sync, you might want to consider giving this new option in version 2.2 a try. Once enabled in the Sync settings, iCloud integration will sync mute filters, timeline positions, and DM read status across all instances of Tweetbot. This means that, if you’re using iCloud on your iOS devices running Tweetbot, the app will keep your position in the Twitter timeline synced similarly to how Tweet Marker works, only it will also sync your direct messages’ read status (if you read a DM on your iPhone, it will also be automatically marked as read on the iPad) and mute filters set in the app’s Preferences. In my tests, both Tweet Marker and iCloud have worked reliably when syncing timelines, but I switched to iCloud full-time for the added convenience of syncing DMs and filters across Tweetbot, and because of the lack of Tweet Marker-enabled apps (that I like) on my desktop. In fact, at least for the time being, I’m still using Twitter’s official client on my Mac. With iCloud sync, I can keep more data synced across Tweetbot for iPhone and Tweetbot for iPad, which I use on a daily basis. Please note that, while iCloud is supposed to be “invisible” to the user, working all the time in the background, there may be a short delay of 10-15 seconds when syncing the timeline position across clients, although I have noticed this sporadically. I suggest you use Tweetbot as you normally would, switching from one client to another when you really need to, avoiding keeping both apps open at the same time just to see if iCloud is working.\n\nVersion 2.2 of Tweetbot also brings other improvements and bug fixes throughout the app; most notably, images can now be closed with a pinch gesture on the iPad (similarly to how you can close images in Photos) and both iTunes and YouTube links have gained thumbnail previews in the timeline.\n\nFor the past months, I have been increasingly using my iPad as my primary computer, and thus Tweetbot has become the Twitter client I spend the most time using on my iOS devices. This newest update increases the overall stability and performances of the app, but more importantly it brings a native, consistent way to sync data across platforms that, at this point, can only get better in the future – and it’s already working admirably now.\n\nYou can get Tweetbot 2.2 on the App Store today.\n\n- [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n- [Tweetbot for iPad](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n[Tweetbot Gets iCloud Sync for Timelines, DMs, and Mute Filters](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-icloud-sync-for-timelines-dms-and-mute-filters\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 2.3 Adds New Gestures, Integrations, UI Refinements\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&29480_IMG_0210.png)\nLess than a month after a major 2.2 update that [added](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-icloud-sync-for-timelines-dms-and-mute-filters\/) iCloud sync for timelines, DMs, and mute filters, [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) is back today with a significant update on the iPhone and iPad that redefines some of the gestures and interactions introduced with the original version 1.0 (2.0 on the iPhone). Overhauling the standalone tweet detail and conversation views that, based on intuitive gestures, were two of Tweetbot’s hallmark features, Tweetbot 2.3 unifies single tweets, actions, replies, and conversations within redesigned screens that, with a bit of practice, I believe will ultimately help saving time and precious taps around the app.\n\n## New Tweet Detail View\n\n### Quick access: swipe right to left on a tweet.\n\nThe single tweet view – the screen that displays a user’s single tweet alongside the action bar, geo-location and client info, and other data – has been redesigned to accomodate inline conversations and replies. Providing the usual context for author, buttons to reply, retweet, fave, share, and view, the new tweet detail view elegantly puts a banner-like notification up top to indicate how many replies a specific tweet received; if the tweet belongs to a conversation, Tweetbot 2.3 displays a “In reply to…” section at the bottom (down to the original tweet that started the conversation), with additional replies *above*.\n\nThe developers have managed to cram a lot of information and elements into a single screen without sacrificing usability and clarity – unlike other apps, it’s always clear which tweets belong to a conversation and which ones generated other replies.\n\nTo go back to the timeline from the tweet detail view, you can now quickly swipe with one finger from left to right. [Here’s a recap](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/) of all the gestures and tap actions supported in Tweetbot from our review of the iPad version (interactions are mostly the same on iPhone).\n\n## New Conversation View & Sharing\n\n### Quick access: swipe left to right on a tweet.\n\nSimilarly, the new conversation view of Tweetbot 2.3 displays both conversations and replies inline. Accessible with the usual swipe-to-reveal action, the conversation view loads replies in a neatly separated section just like the aforementioned tweet detail view.\n\nNew in 2.3, conversations can now be uploaded directly to social curation platform [Storify](http:\/\/storify.com\/) for further sharing with the world; the uploading process is automatic and doesn’t require a dedicated login, meaning that Tweetbot will simply publish a conversation, such as [this one](http:\/\/storify.com\/viticci\/conversation-with-viticci-and-benjaminzamayo), to Storify using your Twitter account. Whilst I hope for a future version of Tweetbot to let me save “all replies” to a specific tweet from the detail view (right now, it’s only enabled in the Conversation window), I think Tapbots did the right thing in simplifying the curation aspect of Storify and make it available as a direct option without additional configuration required.\n\nAlso new in the 2.3 conversation view (but enabled for single tweets and DMs as well): the app now has an improved email format when sending tweets to someone else via email.\n\n## More Features in 2.3\n\nSeveral additional refinements and improvements went into the development of Tweetbot 2.3. First off, Droplr support: for URLs, images, and videos, users have now the option to choose Droplr as a sharing service in the Settings. When shared, videos now have a dedicated “play” thumbnail to differentiate them from images, and thumbnail support has been added for Vimeo links, too.\n\nThe app now correctly recognizes $stock links, allowing you to easily fire up a search for $AAPL or your favorite stock, and save it for future usage.\n\nThe tweet drawer has been reorganized, with the last two buttons gaining more order in the process.\n\nLast, some minor touches in version 2.3 will contribute to improving usability and to allowing users customize their timelines to their needs and tastes: retweets from specific users can now be disabled at any time, and it’s possible to quickly open the last saved draft by holding down the tweet compose button. The timeline sync bookmark icon is now an optional setting, and Tweetbot is capable of uploading high-res images when on WiFi.\n\nWith important improvements and UI refinements aimed at increasing the app’s ease of use and display of information, Tweetbot 2.3 is another solid and rich update that adds powerful functionality without compromising the app’s interaction and workflow. You can get Tweetbot 2.3 on the App Store today.\n\n- [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n- [Tweetbot for iPad](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n[Tweetbot 2.3 Adds New Gestures, Integrations, UI Refinements](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-3-adds-new-gestures-integrations-ui-refinements\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 2.4 Brings New Search View, Keyword Mute Filters, Refinements\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&29887_search-and-top.png)\nFollowing updates focused on [iCloud sync](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-icloud-sync-for-timelines-dms-and-mute-filters\/) and [gestures](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-3-adds-new-gestures-integrations-ui-refinements\/), Tweetbot 2.4, released today on the App Store ( [iPhone](http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-twitter-client-personality\/id428851691?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg), [iPad](http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-twitter-client-personality\/id498801050?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg) ), brings an updated search view with additional location features, relocated Trends and People categories, and various improvements that make the client’s search functionality more powerful and intuitive.\n\n## Search\n\nThe new Search tab unifies Trends, People, and Top Tweets under a Browse section, with Saved Searches and the classic search box still available at the top of the screen. The dedicated Top Tweets option is quite enjoyable – I have indeed found myself browsing such flow of status updates on a couple of times for the occasional laugh or remarkably snarky tweet. Top tweets now also show up in regular search results, and they are marked by a silver star indicator.\n\nTrends, on the other hand, can be changed to another location directly from the search view of Tweetbot 2.4 – I don’t use Trends, but I assume the option will come in handy for those who, for some reason, like to check the recurring trend in Italy.\n\nThe big addition in Tweetbot’s new search interface is support for nearby tweets. Here, you can view nearby tweets with the ability to change your location (just tap on the embedded Google Map), and you can perform location-based keyword searches for tweets containing specific words that also happen to be located near you. Unfortunately, Viterbo resembles a ghost town when it comes to looking for fellow local MacStories readers. I asked Tapbots, and they confirmed my town’s insistence of loading @viticci as the only local MacStories tweeter isn’t an app’s bug.\n\nThere are two more little touches I like in Tweetbot 2.4: you can double-tap the search tab to open search with the keyboard, and the search box has been optimized to let you easily jump to tweets, users, or a specific @user without additional taps.\n\n## Keyword Mute Filters\n\nTweetbot has been offering advanced mute filtering options for [quite some time now](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-5\/). Version 2.4 now allows you to block specific keywords – not just users or clients – and there’s even support for [regular expression](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regular_expression) if you really want to make sure you’re not reading about the latest spoilers in Game Of Thrones. Mentions can be muted as well.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThere are plenty of other refinements in Tweetbot 2.4. Offline support, for instance, will ensure tweets marked as favorite or sent to a Read Later service when no Internet connection is available will get “queued”, then sent\/favorited as soon as you come back online. Sure enough, while browsing my timeline in Airplane mode, I fave’d a couple of tweets, sent some links to Pocket, and Tweetbot queued them. When I turned WiFi back on, the app refreshed, the tweets were marked as favorites in my account, and they appeared in my Pocket.\n\nOn the iPad, web and map views can now be dismissed with a two-finger swipe down gesture, which I found incredibly convenient and faster than reaching out for the Close button in the upper left corner. Also on the iPad, list views show one line of a list or profile description, and when viewing an image in full-screen, you can hold down for options.\n\nAdditionally, aside from the usual bug fixes, you can now swipe to the right on profile views to go back; items sent to Pinboard are marked as unread; and last, the compose screen comes with basic smart quote support (for quotes, em dash, and ellipsis).\n\nWith powerful new features and UI refinements added to an existing set of great functionalities, Tweetbot 2.4 retains familiarity while striving to remain the best third-party Twitter app for iOS.

This is *not a final review* of the app: being in the development stage – albeit ready to be tested by the public – Tweetbot for Mac is still lacking several features that will be available in the final Mac App Store version (such as iCloud sync and Notification Center support), and for this reason I’ll save my full analysis of the app for the future.\n\nHowever, I have been testing Tweetbot for the past week, and I can say that it already is the best Twitter client available on the Mac.\n\n## Gimme Shelter\n\nEver since Loren Brichter (creator of the original Tweetie, [who sold his app](http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2010\/04\/twitter-for-iphone.html) to Twitter and went on to work there) [left the company](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/11\/04\/loren-brichter-creator-of-official-twitter-apps-for-mac-and-iphone-leaves-twitter\/), Twitter for Mac – what [I had deemed](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/twitter-for-mac-review-love-it-hate-it-tweet-it\/) as the best Twitter client for OS X – fell into an unexplainable state of abandon and lack of updates. You would think it’s in Twitter’s best interest to keep a native client up to date with the latest features of the service; and yet, after a solid first version – which came after years of speculation on Tweetie 2 – Twitter started ignoring the app, failing to bring several of Twitter’s new features (such as inline media and updated search) to the desktop. It only got worse recently: after many updates to Lion, Twitter for Mac has started showing new bugs and glitches that haven’t been fixed by Twitter, alongside the ones that have always been there and were never corrected. And then with the release of the Retina MacBook Pro, Twitter’s lack of support for high-res text and graphics became the proverbial final nail in the coffin of what used to be a great app.\n\nThe saddest part, however, is that in spite of its current state and overall “what could have been” feeling attached to it, Twitter for Mac still is, for many, the best shot at a decent native Twitter experience on the Mac. On OS X, there aren’t as many Twitter third-party apps as on iOS, but still software like [Twitterrific](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/mac\/twitterrific-4-for-mac-review\/), [Hibari](http:\/\/hibariapp.com\/) and [Osfoora](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/mac\/review-osfoora-for-mac\/) have provided good options to users looking outside the classic Tweetie environment. The problem is, there is a whole segment of Twitter for Mac users that, like me, [have been stuck with Tweetie’s paradigms](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/mac\/tweetie-2-for-mac-is-alive-and-it-will-be-free\/) and features for more or less three years now, as other desktop apps – while promising – have always lacked that feature or two that would make them a must-have. And it’s likely that those users have only been able to use another equally feature-rich Twitter client on another platform: Tweetbot.\n\nThus, Tweetbot for Mac. I won’t go into any more detail about Tapbots’ success with Tweetbot on the iPhone and iPad: I have reviewed both apps [extensively here at MacStories](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/), and their success is very much history at this point. Tweetbot, for me, is the best Twitter client ever produced on iOS; its design, feature set, and care for the details contribute to providing a fantastic Twitter experience for users looking for more than just scrolling the timeline or casually checking out a link or two. Tweetbot is made for people who see the richness in the information that travels across Twitter, and Tweetbot for Mac wants to offer the same powerful iOS experience on the Mac, with no compromises. As Cody [wrote in his review of Twitter 4.3](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/twitter-twitter-4-3-and-the-mixed-message\/), Tweetbot users want features – and Tweetbot for Mac aims at delivering on this premise, for all those users who have been impatiently waiting for it.\n\nLike I said, it would be unfair to judge Tweetbot for Mac for what it is now as the app is still lacking several functionalities both because of Apple’s own limitations (only Mac App Store apps can use iCloud and Notification Center; the latter is also exclusive to the upcoming Mountain Lion) and due to the ongoing development of the client. For instance, there is limited support for keyboard shortcuts, there are some rough edges around the interface, and one of my favorite features of Twitter for Mac – being able to navigate and switch sections with gestures – isn’t yet available. Indeed, [Tapbots say](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/tweetbot\/tweetbot-for-mac) that features like better management of multiple windows will be coming in the future, and they confirmed in a blog post that they are planning “ on making everything as beautiful and pixel perfect” as they can. Don’t be surprised if, in this version, some pixels will look misaligned or out of place. Eventually, it will all be fixed.\n\nNotably, Tapbots wants you to keep in mind that this is a public alpha – a free trial of a piece of software that will be sold for a price on the App Store. While feedback and crash reports are welcome now, when the app hits 1.0, you’ll have to decide whether or not it’s worth your cash. According to Tapbots, a final price hasn’t been set yet.\n\nToday’s public alpha of Tweetbot is definitely what it sounds like: an unfinished product that needs feedback and more testing before being ready for primetime. And yet the essence of what Tweetbot for Mac will be like is already here, and I can tell it’ll make for a fantastic app.\n\n## Back to the Mac\n\nTweetbot for Mac acts like [Tweetbot for iPad](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/) for the most part. It looks like Tweetbot for iPad with a sidebar on the left for Timeline, Mentions, Messages, Favorites, Search, Profile, Lists, Retweets, and Filters; the timeline design is the same, sections inside the app look the same, user profiles and conversations look just like their iOS counterparts.\n\nTweetbot is a consistent experience across platforms.\n\nSome features of Tweetbot for iOS have been ported to the Mac with no modifications. Double-clicking on the title bar will scroll to the top of any timeline, and clicking on one of the sections on the left when inside a conversation or multiple levels into navigation will go back to the “root” of the section, just like iOS. Unlike Twitter for Mac, navigation isn’t implemented with breadcrumbs – it uses an iOS-like back button. Those familiar with [Favstar](http:\/\/favstar.fm\/) and the double-tap action on Tweetbot’s Profile tab will appreciate the same option available as double-click on Tweetbot for Mac.\n\nThe app makes use of an iOS-inspired popover to load lists that you can use as your main timeline: just click on the lists button in the title bar and choose between your lists, private lists, or followed ones. If you want to keep tabs on multiple timelines, you can open a separate window by hitting CMD-Shift-N; I found this option particularly handy to keep my personal account in one window, and a special list (or the @macstoriesnet account) in another one. Tapbots said that, in future versions of the app, window management will be “much more elegant”.\n\nA popover is also used for the compose widget, which resembles Twitter’s one but adds the typical options you’re used to seeing in Tweetbot: switching accounts and adding location and images to tweets. The popover can be detached, and you can keep multiple ones on screen simultaneously (notice how the little arrow disappears as you detach the popover).\n\nYou can add images through the action button in the compose widget, or via drag & drop. Once attached, an image will be displayed as a thumbnail in the compose area; images are also displayed inline in the timeline, and clicking on one will first display a new loading indicator, then a floating preview that you can resize and move around on screen.\n\nOther features that underline the consistency of functionality and design choices chosen by Tapbots are shown in the Settings, which include more already-seen stuff like Tweet Marker sync, new tweets bar, font size options, and various online accounts to configure.\n\nWhen you reach the top of the timeline, like on iOS, Tweetbot will show that it’s streaming, with no need to manually refresh.\n\nIf you’re familiar with Tweetbot on iOS, you’ll instantly know how to use Tweetbot for Mac.\n\nThat’s not to say, though, that Tapbots is simply taking a successful iOS app and putting a native Mac wrapper around it. Tweetbot for Mac wants to be a native Mac application, and for this reason Tapbots had to rethink some of the interactions that couldn’t be suitable for a point-and-click system such as the Mac.\n\nBecause on the Mac it is possible to implement the concept of “hover” through the cursor, the tweet drawer’s options (reply, retweet, fave, share, more) are shown when hovering over a tweet, and they are presented inside contextual menus: this helps reducing the number of clicks needed to navigate around tweets, and it stays true to the nature of OS X while adapting Tweetbot’s existing feature to different patterns and possible scenarios.\n\nI hope the final version of Tweetbot will allow us to assign keyboard shortcuts to sharing actions, much like Reeder for Mac does for RSS articles (tweets can already be scrolled using the keyboard).\n\nSimilarly, direct messages are presented like on iOS, but as you click on a conversation the cursor automatically focuses on the text field, so you can start typing, then send a message with CMD-Return (this also works with normal tweets). There are other instances of iOS features being slightly modified to work on OS X already, such as dictionary definitions with three-finger taps that work on any word in a tweet directly from the timeline, or keyboard shortcuts for switching sections. I’m sure there will be more cases of features coming from Tweetbot for iOS being slightly tweaked to work better on the Mac come the final version of the app.\n\nWhat’s really interesting for now, I believe, is the reason behind Tapbots’ decision to do a public alpha. Typically extremely secretive about their releases, Tweetbot for Mac hasn’t been Tapbot’s best concealed effort to date, but there’s a long way between [teasing app screenshots and icon](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apps\/2012\/06\/21\/tapbots-designer-shows-off-first-screenshot-of-twitter-for-mac-on-retina-macbook-pro\/)  and doing a public alpha testing period. According to Tapbots’ blog post, they released the public alpha to get the motivation to finish faster, and receive valuable feedback, as developing for the Mac is no easy task. I have no inside knowledge about Tapbots’ decision, but I suspect it’s somewhat related to [Twitter’s controversial stance on its API](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/blog\/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience) and letting developers build applications that compete with the native Twitter experience, offering apps that mimic functionality found in Twitter’s own apps.\n\nI don’t think Twitter will ever completely kill off existing products like Tweetbot or Twitterrific, but they may start looking into disapproving *future* new apps that don’t comply with Twitter’s policies. If this theory is correct, Twitter may keep the existing ecosystem intact by “grandfathering” apps, but there could be problems for developers of new apps. And again, if this will be the case, Tapbots may be thinking that, in order to fall into the category of apps that “Twitter can’t kill”, it was necessary to speed up development, build up a userbase in the meantime, and combine the benefits of public alpha testing (lots of feedback) with becoming an established player in the current Twitter API ecosystem.\n\nAs things stand right now, even if Tweetbot isn’t available on the Mac App Store, I think it’s here to stay no matter what Twitter decides to do in the future.\n\n## Wrap-Up (For Now)\n\nTweetbot for Mac’s first alpha feels good. Very good. It still doesn’t offer some of the functionalities that former Tweetie\/Twitter users may have become accustomed to, and, as I mentioned above, I’ll be watching the development of the app closely, saving my complete review for the Mac App Store version. At the same time, however, this public alpha already sports a number of features and little touches that have enabled me to forego the *need* of using Twitter for Mac. In an unordered list of importance:\n\n* Streaming\n* Reliable gap detection\n* View followers inside the app\n* View conversations and replies to tweets separately\n* Copy tweets and links to tweets\n* Mute people, hashtags, keywords, and clients\n* View retweets for a specific tweet\n* Send to Instapaper and Tweet URL as contextual actions\n* View any profile in Favstar\n\nRight now, Tweetbot for Mac is, in my opinion, already superior to any other client for OS X – and it still can be improved. More importantly, Tweetbot makes better use of Twitter features than Twitter’s own Mac app, and that says a lot about the [importance of third-party clients](http:\/\/gedblog.com\/2012\/07\/09\/the-murky-future-of-3rd-party-twitter-apps\/) in this ecosystem.\n\nIf Tweetbot for Mac is an example of “iOS-ification” of Mac software, then I’m glad developers are bringing iOS-inspired features and design ideas back to the Mac. The strategy is working.\n\nDownload Tweetbot for Mac [here](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/tweetbot_mac).\n\n[Tweetbot for Mac: Public Alpha Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-mac-public-alpha-review\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Mute Filters For U.S. Elections\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&30879_iPhone1.png)\nI’ve recently become annoyed with the amount of tweets in my timeline about the upcoming United States elections, so I set out to find a way to mute those tweets without necessarily unfollowing people. In case you missed it, [Tweetbot 2.4 introduced support](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-4-brings-new-search-view-keyword-mute-filters-refinements\/) for keyword mute filtering, allowing you to mute (read: make invisible in the timeline) any keyword, with support for [regular expression](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regular_expression). I manually added hashtags and keywords to the list of filters on my iPhone, iPad, and Mac, but it turns out someone already made a set of filters you can easily install on your devices.\n\nThanks to [Jono Hunt](https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonohunt\/statuses\/241104756699955200), you can head over [this GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/jonohunt\/Mute-filters-for-Tweetbot\/blob\/master\/Mute%20Filters%20for%20Tweetbot.md) and check out the 2012 U.S. elections regular expression he built for Tweetbot. You can add keywords in the middle if you feel like you should be blocking more from your timeline. To install the filter, open the Mute Filters view in Tweetbot, hit the Edit button, then the + button in the upper left corner and select Mute Keyword. Paste the filter, and turn on  Regular Expression. You can set a duration (I chose “forever”) and mute mentions for the filter as well. To make sure you’re entering the expression correctly, Tweetbot will also display matching tweets *already* in your timeline.\n\nJono has built other mute filters for recurring tweets besides the elections, so check them out [here](https:\/\/github.com\/jonohunt\/Mute-filters-for-Tweetbot\/blob\/master\/Mute%20Filters%20for%20Tweetbot.md).\n\n[Tweetbot Mute Filters For U.S. Elections](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/tweetbot-mute-filters-for-u-s-elections\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for Mac Review\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&31575_Screen-Shot-2012-10-18-at-6.17.23-AM.png)\nWhen the first alpha of Tweetbot for Mac [came out in July](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-mac-public-alpha-review\/), I said I would take a look at the app again. Here we are, three months later, with the [final version of Tweetbot for Mac available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?ls=1&amp;mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg).\n\nI concluded my review of the public alpha version with:\n\n> Right now, Tweetbot for Mac is, in my opinion, already superior to any other client for OS X — and it still can be improved. More importantly, Tweetbot makes better use of Twitter features than Twitter’s own Mac app, and that says a lot about the importance of third-party clients in this ecosystem.  \n\nIn calling the alpha version of Tweetbot a “superior” product, I took quite a stance. I had been using the alpha for weeks before the public release, and I had the perspective and context to make a conscious and reasonable decision about my statement. I knew I was going to like Tweetbot and use it on a daily basis. Three months later, that’s still the case.\n\nI’ll get to the point right away. Tweetbot is, in my opinion, the best Twitter client for Mac. From my perspective, no other app gets closer to the amount of polish and functionality that Tapbots poured into their latest creation, making it the most powerful, fast, and elegant Twitter app I’ve seen on OS X to date. In hindsight, it’s also a superior product than Twitter for Mac, which, as you may recall, [used](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/twitter-for-mac-review-love-it-hate-it-tweet-it\/) to be my go-to client. Three months ago I reviewed an app that I *knew* was going to be great.\n\nIn thinking about how I should approach this new review, I came to the conclusion that you don’t need me to go through the backstory of Twitter clients on the Mac. Here’s what I wrote, again, for context:\n\n> Ever since Loren Brichter (creator of the original Tweetie, who sold his app to Twitter and went on to work there) left the company, Twitter for Mac — what I had deemed as the best Twitter client for OS X — fell into an unexplainable state of abandon and lack of updates. You would think it’s in Twitter’s best interest to keep a native client up to date with the latest features of the service; and yet, after a solid first version — which came after years of speculation on Tweetie 2 — Twitter started ignoring the app, failing to bring several of Twitter’s new features (such as inline media and updated search) to the desktop. It only got worse recently: after many updates to Lion, Twitter for Mac has started showing new bugs and glitches that haven’t been fixed by Twitter, alongside the ones that have always been there and were never corrected. And then with the release of the Retina MacBook Pro, Twitter’s lack of support for high-res text and graphics became the proverbial final nail in the coffin of what used to be a great app.  \n\nTwitter for Mac still hasn’t received an update since last year. Some say it’s [no longer in development](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/09\/06\/reportedly-development-to-cease-for-twitters-mac-client\/).\n\nIn my review of Tweetbot Alpha, I briefly touched upon features that were missing from the app:\n\n> For instance, there is limited support for keyboard shortcuts, there are some rough edges around the interface, and one of my favorite features of Twitter for Mac — being able to navigate and switch sections with gestures — isn’t yet available. Indeed, Tapbots say that features like better management of multiple windows will be coming in the future, and they confirmed in a blog post that they are planning “ on making everything as beautiful and pixel perfect” as they can. Don’t be surprised if, in this version, some pixels will look misaligned or out of place. Eventually, it will all be fixed.  \n\nIt is with this standpoint that I want to look at Tweetbot again: you don’t need me to know what Tweetbot is or what it looks like. Between the Mac and iOS, we’ve covered Tweetbot [extensively here at MacStories](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/).\n\nWhat follows is my review of Tweetbot 1.0 based on *how I use* the final version of the app. The little features and the details I’ve come to rely upon, and the overall functionality that makes Tweetbot the best Twitter client for Mac.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\nOne of the key features missing from the initial alpha of Tweetbot was support for keyboard shortcuts. At some point, every Mac user – not necessarily [the “power” ones](http:\/\/5by5.tv\/mpu) – gets curious about keyboard shortcuts, as they can be fantastic timesavers. Tweetbot for Mac doesn’t disappoint: it comes with many different shortcuts for timelines (i.e. “views”) and tweets.\n\n### Navigation and Views\n\n**Command + 1…9** to open specific sections of the app. Sections are called “tabs”, and they are available in the Window menu. Available tabs are: Timeline (1), Mentions (2), Messages (3), Favorites (4), Search (5), Profile (6), Lists (7), Retweets (8), and Mutes (9).\n\nIf you’re already in a tab and you hit Command +1…9 the app will go back to the top level of the view (eg. you’re viewing someone’s profile, the app will go back to timeline) so you don’t have to hit the Back button. If you’re already in the top level, the shortcut will scroll to the top.\n\nTabs available in Tweetbot’s sidebar can be customized. From View > Displayed Tabs, choose the tabs you want to exclude from the sidebar by deselecting them. Even if a tab is hidden, you’ll still be able to access it with the shortcuts mentioned above.\n\nA bunch of shortcuts are available in the View menu:\n\n* You can scroll to top or bottom using **Command + Up** and **Command + Down**, respectively.\n* You can move to the Next Tab using **Command + ]** and to the Previous Tab using **Command + [** – choosing “Previous Tab” when you’re in the Timeline tab will cycle back to the bottom one (Mutes).\n* If you add Shift to the Previous\/Next Tab shortcut, you’ll get Previous\/Next Account.\n* Not listed, but you can Page up and down using Space and Shift + Space; this also works with Home and End on keyboards with those keys.\n\nIn Tweetbot, you can open Tabs in new windows or columns. You can also open specific views such as user profiles or a saved search in columns or windows. To open the current view in a new window, use **Command + Shift + N**; to open in a new column, the shortcut is **Command + Option + N**. You can then remove specific columns from the View > Columns menu, or by hitting the gear icon icon in the bottom right corner of the main window. You can **tab** and **shift-tab** to move between columns.\n\nTweetbot’s windows can be resized. However, the “separate” ones don’t support shortcuts for changing tabs, as they are, essentially, single-purpose views turned into a window.\n\nYou can go to a specific user by hitting **Command + U** and typing its username. Tweetbot will try to autocomplete it.\n\n### Actions\n\nTweetbot comes with several “action shortcuts” for tweets and integration with third-party services.\n\nTo compose a tweet, hit Command + N, and Command + W to close the compose box. If you’ve typed something in the box and try to close it, Tweetbot will ask you to save the tweet as a draft. Drafts can be opened with **Command + 0**, which will display a separate window for all your saved tweets; click on one, and the tweet will open again in the compose box, ready to be sent.\n\nYou can perform various actions on selected tweets. Command + R will initiate a reply to the author of a tweet, with additional mentioned usernames selected so you can remove them instantly (it basically defaults to Reply All). Command + D will send a Direct Message to the author; **F** will mark a tweet as favorite; T will retweet, and **Option + T** will “quote” the selected tweet. Command + K will mark all tweets in a tab as read.\n\nTweetbot uses streaming by default, but you can also manually refresh a view by pulling down tweets to unveil the loading bar, or by hitting Command + Shift + R. Please note, though, that if the app is streaming you can’t actually pull to refresh: if streaming *fails*, you can. You can also pull to refresh views that don’t stream, like Search and Lists.\n\nWhen a tweet is selected, the entire app is navigable using the keyboard: up\/down arrows will let you move between tweets, the right arrow key will open a tweet’s detail view and left will always work as a “Back” button. If you are in the tweet detail view and you hit the right arrow, you’ll go to the user’s profile.\n\nIt gets more interesting with actions available inside the **Tweet > Action** menu. You can open the links contained in a selected tweet with **Command + Shift + L**: if the link is a regular http:\/\/ hyperlink, it’ll open in the default browser; if it’s an inline image, the shortcut will bring up the app’s image viewer.\n\nThe image viewer comes with a sharing button to save the image (it’ll be placed in your Downloads folder), copy it, view it on the web, or tweet the URL. To close the image, you can hit Esc or the Space bar. In this first version of the app, I’ve encountered a bug that, when the browser is minimized in the Dock, will bring it up in slow motion (I assume it’s because the shortcut includes Shift, which triggers the slow-motion effect system-wide).\n\nThere are two more actions that have been assigned a keyboard shortcut: you can quickly open a user’s profile by pressing **Command + Shift + U** on a tweet; and if a tweet belongs to a conversation, you can hit Command + Shift + C to view it.\n\n## Contextual Menus\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&31575_con2.jpeg)\nadamtyree, I haven’t really blocked you. We’re cool.\n\nMenus \n\nWhere Tweetbot doesn’t get with keyboard shortcuts, it does with contextual menus. In July, I wrote:\n\n> That’s not to say, though, that Tapbots is simply taking a successful iOS app and putting a native Mac wrapper around it. Tweetbot for Mac wants to be a native Mac application, and for this reason Tapbots had to rethink some of the interactions that couldn’t be suitable for a point-and-click system such as the Mac.  \n\n> Because on the Mac it is possible to implement the concept of “hover” through the cursor, the tweet drawer’s options (reply, retweet, fave, share, more) are shown when hovering over a tweet, and they are presented inside contextual menus: this helps reducing the number of clicks needed to navigate around tweets, and it stays true to the nature of OS X while adapting Tweetbot’s existing feature to different patterns and possible scenarios.  \n\nIn Tweetbot for iOS, you can tap & hold on certain elements to bring up additional options; in Tweetbot for Mac, tap & hold becomes right-clicking (or Control-clicking).\n\n* A right-click on a tweet will let you: Copy Link to Tweet, Copy Tweet, Email Tweet, View Details\/Conversations\/Retweets, Open in Favstar, and Translate.\n* If you right-click on a link, you can send to a Read Later service, Tweet the URL, Open in Browser, Copy, and Email the URL.\n* Right-click on a user (link or profile picture) will check follow status, and offer options for DM, Manage in Lists, Disable Retweets, Mute, and Unfollow.\n* Right-click on a sidebar tab will let you open it in a new column or window.\n* Right-click on your own username will allow you to view your profile in Favstar; the same can be done by double-clicking on the Profile tab.\n* Double-clicking any tab scrolls it to the top (or to last-synced position).\n* Control-clicking on the retweet action icon in Timeline will let you choose the account to retweet from.\n* Control-clicking on the fave action icon in Timeline will let you award the “Tweet of the Day” through Favstar.\n\nOverall, I find the selection of Tweetbot’s contextual menus rich and intuitive – it’s in line with the iOS counterpart (therefore making it easy to switch between the two), yet, at the same time, it stays true to the nature of the Mac.\n\n### Gestures\n\nThere’s one area of the app where I think Tapbots could have done more: gestures. Right now, Tweetbot only supports:\n\n* Two finger swipe –> Status details\n* Two finger swipe <– Conversation\n\nIn my Twitter for Mac days, I quickly became a fan of the three-finger gesture that allowed you to swipe vertically to move between sections in the sidebar. I wish Tapbots did the same for tabs in Tweetbot. I’d also like to see gestures from iOS, such as triple taps, finding their way to the Mac. I do appreciate how Tapbots decided to render text natively in the app, thus enabling OS X system features such as triple tap to define in Dictionary within the Timeline (however, text is only selectable in the tweet detail view).\n\nTo overcome the lack of vertical swipes to change tabs, I set up two [BetterTouchTool](http:\/\/blog.boastr.net\/) gestures for the job: swipe up to go to the next tab, swipe down to go up (per Apple’s own scrolling paradigm). On my computer, which has keyboard input set to Italian, I had to go with one extra step to pipe the shortcut for changing tabs through Keyboard Maestro, as I [showed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/statuses\/258604407829176320) yesterday; if you don’t want to use Keyboard Maestro, you could achieve the same “hack” using BetterTouchTool and [GUI scripting](http:\/\/www.macosxautomation.com\/applescript\/uiscripting\/index.html), or anything that associates gestures with Tweetbot’s Previous\/Next Tab menu. I also noticed a visual bug in which, occasionally, the selected tab won’t be properly highlighted in the sidebar.\n\n## Using Tweetbot\n\nHere’s how I use Tweetbot: I leave it open all day, reading my timeline and checking for links to interesting stuff that happens online. If someone mentions me, I want to double-check what I’m replying to, and I want to be able to see an entire conversation. I mark a lot of tweets as favorite (more [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/send-favorite-tweets-to-omnifocus-inbox\/) ), I have a saved search for “MacStories”, and I mute a lot of hashtags or keywords I’m not interested into (such as sports and [politics](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/tweetbot-mute-filters-for-u-s-elections\/) ). Every once in a while, I try to be a witty and funny guy with [Matthew Panzarino](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/author\/matthewpanzarino\/) or my colleague [Don](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/author\/don\/).\n\nI need a Twitter client that can handle the workflow described above and, more importantly, remember my position in the Timeline.\n\nTweetbot fits like a glove. Maybe it’s because I got used to the app over time. Or perhaps I’m just particularly good at feature requests. Any way I look at it, I can’t seem to find any other client that can achieve the same degree of functionality.\n\nThere’s a fine line between consistency and uniqueness on each platform, and Tweetbot walks it gracefully. The design cues are the same, the interactions are shared across devices, but there’s always a little implementation detail or a subtle graphical change that reminds you which Tweetbot is which. Quite paradoxically, there are more differences between various instances of Tweetbot than between Tweetbot and [Netbot](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/netbot-tweetbot-reborn-for-app-net\/).\n\n### Columns\n\nTweetbot for Mac lets you put sections and views in columns. As those who’ve used apps like Tweetdeck before may remember, columns can become an important “productivity booster” for people who use Twitter for, say, customer support and need to keep an eye on replies and saved searches.\n\nWith the aforementioned “Open in New Column” command, you can do exactly that. During major Apple events or news, for example, I like to keep columns open on saved searches and MacStories’ mention stream so I can stay on top of the tweets being shared.\n\nIn Tweetbot, columns “snap” onto an existing window on the right. You can create multiple columns, but you can’t switch the section focus of a column once it’s been created. To “detach” a column to make it a window and close it, grab the “handle” in the bottom bar and drag the column away. There are still some bugs with attaching columns of different sizes to the main window.\n\nFor a future version of the app, I’d like to see full-screen support, as it makes sense for layouts of 3+ columns.\n\n### Custom Uploads\n\nTweetbot for Mac is, as far as I know, the only Twitter client that supports custom API endpoints for media uploads. I asked our [Don Southard](https:\/\/twitter.com\/binaryghost) to put together a solution that would leverage our Rackspace CDN to handle images and videos; he came up with an easy way to share images in Tweetbot natively, using our own server. You can find his explanation of the feature below.\n\n#### Custom Uploads\n\nTweetbot is the only Twitter client for Mac (that I know of) that supports the ability to upload your photos to a custom image service of your choice. This includes the ability to host your own image sharing service on a web server with nothing more than a few lines of PHP. So what we made is a simple PHP script that we self-host; it accepts the image from Tweetbot and responds with the uploaded URL.\n\nTweetbot provides [short but useful information](http:\/\/tapbots.net\/tweetbot\/custom_media\/) about how it uses HTTP POST to upload the picture and what information is passed along with the image.\n\nFor the MacStories image upload service we opted to use our Rackspace Cloud Files account to host the images. They have a great PHP library that does all the hard work of getting the image objects on to the server. After the image is uploaded to Rackspace the script only needs to echo a JSON encoded response. This code is saved to a PHP file on your web server along with the  [Cloud Files PHP library](https:\/\/github.com\/rackspace\/php-cloudfiles).\n\n**Update 10\/19**: Modified the scripts adding a check to make sure they can only receive images or videos (not scripts or other files). Keep in mind, the URL of the PHP file is private – don’t share it with anyone.\n\n>   \n```\n<?php\n\r\n\/\/ include the API\n\r\nrequire('cloudfiles.php');\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Rackspace Info\n\r\n$username = \"USERNAME\"; \/\/ username\n\r\n$key = \"XXX\"; \/\/ api key\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Connect to Rackspace\n\r\n$auth = new CF_Authentication($username, $key);\n\r\n$auth->authenticate();\n\r\n$conn = new CF_Connection($auth);\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Get the container we want to use\n\r\n$container = $conn->get_container('Mobile_Uploads');\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ store image information from Tweetbot\n\r\n$localfile = $_FILES['media']['tmp_name'];\n\r\n$filename = $_FILES['media']['name'];\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Image filetype check source:\n\r\n\/\/ http:\/\/designshack.net\/articles\/php-articles\/smart-file-type-detection-using-php\/\n\r\n$imginfo_array = getimagesize($localfile);\n\r\n\r\nif ($imginfo_array !== false) {\n\r\n    $mime_type = $imginfo_array['mime'];\n\r\n    $mime_array = array(\"video\/quicktime\", \"image\/png\", \"image\/jpeg\", \"image\/gif\", \"image\/bmp\");\n\r\n    if (in_array($mime_type , $mime_array)) {\n \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t$now = time();\n\r\n\t\t$uploadFilename = $now.'-'.$filename;\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\/\/ upload image to Rackspace\n\r\n\t\t$object = $container->create_object($uploadFilename);\n\r\n\t\t$object->load_from_filename($localfile);\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\/\/ Respond image URL to Tweetbot (Change to your URL)\n\r\n\t\t$outputFilename = 'http:\/\/files.domain.com\/' . basename($uploadFilename);\n\r\n\t\t$response = array(url=>$outputFilename);\n\r\n\t\techo json_encode($response);\n\r\n \r\n    }\n\r\n}\n\r\nelse {\n\r\n    echo \"This is not a valid image file\";\n\r\n}\n\r\n\r\n?>\n```\n\nMost of you probably do not have a Rackspace Cloud Files account and that’s not a problem because you can also just upload images directly to the web server with only a few tweaks.\n\nWithout the Rackspace dependencies this code is even simpler. Save this PHP code to a file (ie. upload.php) on your web server.\n\n>   \n```\n<?php\n   \r\n\/\/server-side directory\n\r\n$directory_self = str_replace(basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']), '', $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);\n \r\n$uploadsDirectory = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $directory_self .

Tweetbot will send images to your server and you can enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling that comes with hosting, sharing, and owning your own photos online.\n\nIn addition to hosting your own PHP script for uploading images, you can also setup a custom domain. In your domain provider’s DNS settings, simply forward that directly to the directory that will be hosting your images.\n\nWe have been using Tweetbot’s custom uploads for weeks, and we’re really enjoying it from both Tweetbot for iOS as well as Tweetbot for Mac.\n\n## Services\n\nTweetbot for Mac upholds Tapbots’ tradition to support a plethora of third-party services for sharing and bookmarking. Here are the ones supported in version 1.0:\n\n**URL Shortening**\n\n* Twitter\n* Bitly\n* CloudApp\n* Droplr\n* Custom\n\n**Image Upload**\n\n* CloudApp\n* Droplr\n* img.ly\n* Lockerz\n* Mobypicture\n* Pikchur\n* Posterous\n* Twitgoo\n* TwitPic\n* Twitter\n* yfrog\n* Custom\n\n**Video Upload**\n\n* CloudApp\n* Droplr\n* Mobypicture\n* Pikchur\n* Posterous\n* TwitVid\n* yfrog\n* Custom\n\n**Read Later**\n\n* bitly\n* Instapaper\n* Pinboard\n* Pocket\n* Readability\n\nI think the selection is solid; however, I would like to be able to send links to both Instapaper and Pinboard, without having to pick one.\n\n## Sync and Notifications\n\nLike the iOS version, Tweetbot for Mac supports Tweet Marker and Notification Center. The settings are exactly the same.\n\nThe Mac version also introduces iCloud sync on the desktop, which lets you keep timeline position, as well as read status on DMs and mute filters in sync. In my tests, I had some initial issues in getting Tweetbot for Mac and Tweetbot for iPhone to communicate with each other, and developer Paul Haddad reiterated how iCloud, in its current version, [is still far from perfect](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/the-state-of-icloud-enabled-apps\/). Indeed, it took a few restarts and forced quits before both versions were synced up correctly. After that, everything was pretty smooth and fast – I especially like the convenience of keeping filters consistent between devices.\n\nAs for notifications, I just like how they stay in Notification Center and allow me to go through them later.\n\n## Tips & Tricks\n\nTweetbot’s image viewer supports animated GIFs.\n\nWhen someone faves one of your tweets, it gets the same yellow ribbon tweets *you* fave get. At first I thought I had accidentally faved a tweet of mine. Confusing.\n\nTweetbot’s menubar item is quite powerful: it lists all your accounts and shows you, through badges, how many unread tweets you have in the Timeline, Mentions, and Direct Messages. It lets you jump to those sections by just clicking, and you can even tweet from the menubar item without launching the full app. I wish Tapbots made a keyboard shortcut for this.\n\nFrom the tweet compose box, you can switch between accounts by clicking on your profile picture.\n\nYou can access the same location menu of Tweetbot for iOS by clicking on the location data in the tweet compose box.\n\nUnfortunately, Tweetbot 1.0 doesn’t have an AppleScript dictionary.\n\nYou can edit your Profile without leaving Tweetbot. Just open the Profile tab and click Edit in the upper right corner. You can also change your avatar from the app using the Mac’s standard photo picker.\n\nClicking on a location in a tweet will open Google Maps in the browser. Same with Translate.\n\nYou can drag the compose box to wherever you like.\n\nWith the exception of Search, the same URL scheme of Tweetbot for iOS works on the Mac. It is documented [here](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme). Below, you can find the code for two bookmarklets I have created to tweet a webpage’s URL and a webpage’s Title + URL (too add these, create a new bookmark and replace its address with the code below).\n\n**Tweet title + URL**\n`javascript:window.location='tweetbot:\/\/\/post?text='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+' '+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)`\n\n**Tweet URL**\n`javascript:window.location='tweetbot:\/\/\/post?text='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)`\n\nYou can drag tweets out of Tweetbot.\n\nDragging a tweet to the desktop will create a .webloc file pointing directly to the tweet’s URL; dragging it into iMessage or Mail will insert the tweet’s link as text; dropping a tweet onto Safari’s icon in the Dock will open a new tab for the tweet. This also works with URLs – you can drag those out from within a tweet.\n\n## Still The Best\n\nTweetbot for Mac isn’t the app for people who casually check on Twitter every couple of days: it is [priced at $19.99](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?ls=1&amp;mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg), a clear signal as to the kind of audience Tapbots want to capture. On the other hand, it’s also understandable why Tapbots may want to [save precious Twitter tokens](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apps\/2012\/08\/27\/tweetbot-mac-alpha-pulled-due-new-twitter-rules-developer-preserving-user-slots-official-release\/) for users who really value the feature set of Tweetbot.\n\nThree months ago, what we had was a great Twitter client with several missing features and some rough edges. But, following the premature demise of Twitter for Mac, it *already* was the most powerful one, suggesting good things would be coming soon. Today, Tweetbot for Mac is faster, more reliable (albeit still not perfect, as [some graphical glitches](https:\/\/313e5987718b346aaf83-f5e825270f29a84f7881423410384342.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/glitch.png) persist), and more functional. It is the rightful evolution of an app that showed its potential earlier this year.\n\nTwitter clients are a very personal matter. Using them on a daily basis, they become deeply entrenched in our workflows and, often, they turn into the apps we’re least likely to give up on. Ask the people who still think Twitter for Mac will eventually get an update. For me, Tweetbot works because it’s got what I need from a Twitter client.\n\nWith Tweetbot for Mac, I give my last and official goodbye to [the app that used to be Tweetie](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/goodbye-tweetie\/).\n\nWe don’t know what the future looks like for third-party Twitter clients. For now, with the Mac version, Tweetbot has created its own ecosystem inside Twitter.\n\n[Tweetbot for Mac Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/)\n\n# Convert Twitter.com URLs to Tweetbot Links\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&31618_Screen-Shot-2012-10-22-at-7.17.35-PM.png)\nI communicate with my team through iMessage. We’ve tried many “communication services” over the years, yet, since last Fall, we’ve always come back to Apple’s solution. It’s [not perfect for us](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/omg-imessage-sounds\/), its reliability is far from 100%, but it *works*.\n\nAs we keep using iMessage every day, there’s one category of “media” we’re constantly sharing: Twitter URLs. We find some cool piece of information or news on Twitter, we share it with the team. Linking back to tweets has, in a way, become our favorite type of commentary for fun, news-hunting, and everything in between.\n\nTwitter.com URLs, though, aren’t the best way to jump back to a tweet, especially when you’re on a mobile device. When you’re on a Mac, clicking on a Twitter link will open a new browser tab, which doesn’t really bother us as we’re used to opening background tabs on our computers. But on the iPhone and iPad, it can become annoying: there’s a limit of 8 Safari tabs on the iPhone, you get yanked out of Messages, and, most of the time, [mobile.twitter.com](https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/) URLs just don’t work. In our team chat, we’ve speculated the “Not Found” errors we’ve seen may be related to how Tweetbot generates Twitter URLs when you hit “Copy Link to Tweet”: instead of using `status` in the URL slug, it uses `statuses`, which seems to be the reason behind erroneous redirecting on mobile devices.\n\nWe’ve come to the conclusion that we want to be able to easily copy twitter.com URLs and turn them into links based on [Tweetbot’s URL scheme](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme). Using a simple tweetbot:\/\/ URL, you can use Twitter’s status ID – the same you receive when you copy a link – to open a single tweet **directly in Tweetbot**. And the best part is, the same URL scheme works consistently across Tweetbot for iOS and Tweetbot for Mac. As everyone on the MacStories team is already using Tweetbot, the solution seemed obvious – plus: no more browser tabs.\n\nThe problem was finding a way to convert twitter.com URLs easily, without having to remember complex combinations of keystrokes and commands. Furthermore, as I promised my team I’d come up with a way, I had to figure out a solution to do text conversion directly on iOS.\n\nAs a result, I’ve come up with an AppleScript, a [Keyboard Maestro](http:\/\/www.keyboardmaestro.com\/main\/) macro, and a simple Python script to transform Twitter URLs into their Tweetbot counterparts.\n\n## AppleScript\n\nIn AppleScript, I had to use `text item delimiters` to identify Twitter-specific strings to replace in the text.\n\nRemember, we want to turn `twitter.com` into `tweetbot:\/\/`, and `statuses` into `status`, because that’s how Twitter’s website likes links. Then, we want to be able to easily paste back the modified text so we can share it with someone, or just open the new URL.\n\nUnfortunately, to make the process as automatic as possible, I had to settle on [GUI scripting](http:\/\/www.macosxautomation.com\/applescript\/uiscripting\/index.html). Writing AppleScript commands that rely on visible user interface elements is never advised because a) menu and button names often change with app updates and b) there may be problems with localized apps (menus have different names). However, Tweetbot doesn’t offer an AppleScript dictionary yet, and the “Copy Link to Tweet” action we’re using doesn’t have an associated keyboard shortcut. Which means we have to simulate clicking *an item of a submenu of a menubar dropdown*. Not the best solution, but it works. I look forward to improving this if Tweetbot ever gets AppleScript support.\n\n>   \n```\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\r\n\t\r\n\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n\r\n\t\r\n\t-- MAKE SURE \"ENABLE ACCCESS FOR ASSITIVE DEVICES\" IS ENABLED\n\r\n\ttell application \"Tweetbot\"\n\r\n\t\tactivate\n\r\n\t\ttell application \"System Events\"\n\r\n\t\t\ttell process \"Tweetbot\"\n\r\n\t\t\t\tclick menu item \"Copy Link to Tweet\" of menu 1 of menu item \"Share\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Tweet\" of menu bar 1\n\r\n\t\t\tend tell\n\r\n\t\tend tell\n\r\n\tend tell\n\r\n\t\r\n\t-- DELAY TO IMPROVE RELIABILITY OF COPY\n\r\n\tdelay 1\n\r\n\tset my_URL to the clipboard\n\r\n\t--FIX THE URL\n\r\n\tset the clipboard to my replaceText(\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/\", \"tweetbot:\/\/\", \"statuses\", \"status\", my_URL)\n\r\nend tell\n\r\n\r\n(* \n\r\n======================================\n\r\n\/\/ UTILITY SUBROUTINES\n \r\n======================================\n\r\n*)\n\r\n\r\non replaceText(searchStr, replaceStr, searchStr2, replaceStr2, my_URL)\n\r\n\t-- SET VALUE FOR OLD DELIMITER\n\r\n\tset oldDelim to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n\r\n\t\r\n\t-- CHANGE TWITTER TO TWEETBOT URL\n\r\n\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to searchStr\n\r\n\tset this_text to (text items of my_URL)\n\r\n\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to replaceStr\n\r\n\tset bot_URL to (this_text as string)\n\r\n\t\r\n\t-- FIX SLUG ('STATUSES' TO 'STATUS')\n\r\n\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to searchStr2\n\r\n\tset this_text2 to (text items of bot_URL)\n\r\n\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to replaceStr2\n\r\n\tset fixed_URL to (this_text2 as string)\n\r\n\t\r\n\t-- CHANGE BACK TO ORIGINAL DELIMITER\n\r\n\tset AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelim\n\r\n\t\r\n\treturn fixed_URL\n\r\nend replaceText\n```\n\nAs usual with quick script I’ve put together, I haven’t added a check for assistive devices. Make sure the option is enabled in System Preferences > Accessibility.\n\nOnce I automated the part to copy the Twitter link, I needed to convert that link to the `tweetbot:\/\/` format with minimal effort. Using `text item delimiters` and a handler, the script can identify the portions of the URL we don’t want, and replace them. The “fixed” URL is then placed on the clipboard.\n\nThe provided AppleScript works well with [Alfred](http:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/). Create an extension (or [download this one](https:\/\/b95866a5f9266e48f606-d53104bc2c3381ac4ae7e3133861612f.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/Tweetbot%20URL%20Converter.alfredextension) ), and assign a hotkey to it. Then, in Tweetbot, select a tweet, press the hotkey, and a `tweetbot:\/\/` link to the tweet will be on your clipboard after a second. *Thanks [Justin](http:\/\/veritrope.com\/)for input and feedback.*\n\n## Keyboard Maestro\n\nKeyboard Maestro comes with a “Search and Replace Clipboard” action that fits our needs for this workflow. Once again using GUI scripting, I created a macro (and later, our Gabe Glick improved on it) to copy a tweet’s link and turn it into `tweetbot:\/\/` format.\n\nThe macro is smart in that, if Tweetbot is at the front, it’ll interpret the hotkey as a command to copy a selected tweet and convert the URL; if Tweetbot isn’t the frontmost app, you can use the same hotkey to paste. I personally use this over AppleScript, as I can quickly generate a link, then switch back to Messages and hit the same hotkey to paste.\n\nDownload the macro [here](https:\/\/b95866a5f9266e48f606-d53104bc2c3381ac4ae7e3133861612f.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/TweetbotURLs.kmmacros).\n\n## Pythonista\n\nI’m new to Python, but I’ve been learning the basics in the past few weeks and I’ve been playing around with the fantastic [Pythonista](http:\/\/omz-software.com\/pythonista\/) app on my iPhone and iPad. I’ve therefore created a simple Python script to replace occurrences of `twitter.com` (and its `mobile` and `https` variations), ` print the result, and launch the new URL directly in Tweetbot.\n\n>   \n```\nimport clipboard\n\r\nimport console\n\r\nimport webbrowser\n\r\n\r\nmytext = clipboard.get()\n\r\nmytext = mytext.replace('https:\/\/twitter.com\/', 'tweetbot:\/\/')\n\r\nmytext = mytext.replace('statuses', 'status')\n\r\nmytext = mytext.replace('http:\/\/twitter.com\/', 'tweetbot:\/\/')\n\r\nmytext = mytext.replace('http:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/', 'tweetbot:\/\/')\n\r\nmytext = mytext.replace('https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/', 'tweetbot:\/\/')\n\r\n\r\nconsole.clear()\n\r\nprint mytext\n\r\n\r\nwebbrowser.open(mytext)\n```\n\nOnce configured, it takes a few seconds to launch Pythonista, hit Run, and have the new URL ready in the output. Python users will have no problems modifying the script to, say, set the result to the clipboard.\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nI like to find automated solutions for common problems that no one is fixing. Having to deal with Twitter.com tabs as a Tweetbot user was one of those problems, and I’m glad I’ve set up a system that improves my link-sharing workflow.\n\nIt’s easy to modify the scripts and macro to work with other URL schemes, such as Twitterrific’s. As usual, [ping me](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci) if you’re inspired by this to build something new.\n\n[Convert Twitter.com URLs to Tweetbot Links](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/convert-twitter-com-urls-to-tweetbot-links\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for iPhone 2.6 Adds Custom POIs, Header Images\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&31706_iPhone15.png)\n[Tweetbot 2.6 is out today](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone\/id428851691?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg) on the iPhone, and it’s a minor update from the previous 2.5 version. There are, however, two changes I would like to cover.\n\nTweetbot 2.6 comes with support for Twitter’s new header images for profiles. You’ll have to upload them directly from Twitter’s website – you can’t upload new ones in Tweetbot – but the app will display them nicely in user profiles, just like Tapbots’ other app, [Netbot](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/netbot-tweetbot-reborn-for-app-net\/).\n\nTweetbot 2.6 also lets you create custom POIs for locations. If you think a location is incorrect, or simply would like to customize the location Tweetbot finds, click on the location in the compose screen, and create a custom POI. Be aware that other Tweetbot users will then be able to use the POI, as it’s based on Twitter’s geolocation features and the address of the location.\n\nTweetbot 2.6 is a minor, but nice update. Get it [from the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone\/id428851691?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg).\n\n[Tweetbot for iPhone 2.6 Adds Custom POIs, Header Images](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/tweetbot-for-iphone-2-6-adds-custom-pois-header-images\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 2.6.1 Tweaks UI\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2012-11-19_160329-TB261.jpg)\nA minor update to Tweetbot [has been released today](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone\/id428851691?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg) by Tapbots: among bug fixes, version 2.6.1 introduces a slightly tweaked user interface with a different design for buttons and icons seen throughout the app. Unchanged since [the first version](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), the new icons are similar to the old ones, yet somewhat more rounded and, in my opinion, peculiar.\n\nLike I said, it is a very minor change. However, if you, like me, stare at Tweetbot for several hours a day, it is something you’ll quickly notice upon updating to 2.6.1. It certainly contributes to subtly differentiating Tweetbot from [Netbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/netbot\/), which I appreciate.\n\nTweetbot 2.6.1 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter-iphone\/id428851691?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg).\n\n[Tweetbot 2.6.1 Tweaks UI](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/tweetbot-2-6-1-tweaks-ui\/)\n\n# Disable Auto-Correct In Tweetbot for Mac\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2012-12-05_191634-spellingtweetbot.png)\nI write in English, but I live in Italy. Some of my Twitter followers are Italian, too, and I like to talk to them in my native language. In the past weeks, I noticed an annoying bug: Tweetbot for Mac, my [Twitter client of choice](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/), couldn’t disable auto-correct (Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Correct Spelling Automatically) permanently. The option is there, but it appears it “doesn’t stick” after you enable it to send a tweet without auto-correct. This led to an increasing number of misspelled Italian tweets with English words mixed in (as per my Mac’s system language).\n\nFortunately, I’ve found the solution [here](http:\/\/ayaz.wordpress.com\/2012\/12\/02\/disabling-auto-correct-on-tweetbot-for-mac\/). With a simple Terminal command, you can override Tweetbot’s default setting and disable auto-correct (but not spell checking) automatically.\n\nThis is exactly what I was looking for, so make sure to [hit the source link](http:\/\/ayaz.wordpress.com\/2012\/12\/02\/disabling-auto-correct-on-tweetbot-for-mac\/) to check out the full command.\n\n[Disable Auto-Correct In Tweetbot for Mac](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/disable-auto-correct-in-tweetbot-for-mac\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.1 For Mac\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2012-12-14_000021-tb11.png)\nAn update to Tweetbot for Mac – my [go-to Twitter client](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/) – was released today on the App Store. Tweetbot 1.1 doesn’t bring major new features, but it’s got a fair amount of bug fixes and minor improvements that I like.\n\nFor Mountain Lion users, there’s an “All Notifications” option in the Settings to, literally, receive all notifications for your stream. This means you’ll see every tweet from every user you follow show up in Notification Center as soon as they tweet. I can’t use this because I follow too many people (I would get a notification every few seconds), but it can be useful for timelines following less users. What I really like is the option to show a Visual Sync Marker (like on iOS) and to globally invoke the app\/new tweet window with a hotkey.\n\nLast, there are many other fixes and improvements such as new keyboard shortcuts, better “pin to top” for non-streaming columns, and better compatibility with [Moom](http:\/\/manytricks.com\/moom\/). Tweetbot continues to be my favorite Twitter client on the Mac and it’s available at [$19.99 on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12).\n\n[Tweetbot 1.1 For Mac](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/tweetbot-1-1-for-mac\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Adds Support For Chrome and 1Password Browsers, Vine and Flick Inline Previews\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-02-04_155809-tb27.png)\nTweetbot 2.7, released today for the iPhone and iPad, comes with a new Browser setting to specify an external app for opening links. I have been testing the feature and I’m a big fan of this update.\n\nIn the Settings, you can now choose to open links directly in Safari, Google Chrome, or 1Password. There are two ways to do this: you can choose to keep opening links in Tweetbot’s own web view and *then* forward them to your browser of choice; or you can skip Tweetbot’s web view altogether and go *directly* to a different browser upon tapping a link.\n\nOpening links in Safari and 1Password doesn’t have anything special to it aside from the fact that you’ll be taken out of Tweetbot and into another browser. The 1Password integration is particularly useful as it is, essentially, the same idea behind [my bookmarklet](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/1password-4-1\/), only available inside Tweetbot: if you see a link for a website that you also want to log into, you can use 1Password’s built-in browser to access it.\n\nUsing Chrome alongside Tweetbot is my new favorite option, as it leverages Chrome’s support for [x-callback-url](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/) to enable a completely automated workflow to open Chrome and go back to Tweetbot. If you open a link in Google Chrome, a new tab will open showing a back button labeled “Tweetbot”; once you’re done reading, you can hit that button to automatically close the tab and be taken back to your position in the Tweetbot timeline. Chrome is smart in hiding the back button if you navigate to other pages from the Tweetbot-created tab; the browser also remembers the “special” tab if you switch to other tabs and then go back to the one created by Tweetbot. There’s a minor bug in this version that will redirect to the Tweetbot’s Timeline when you open a link from Mentions, but Tapbots is aware of it. For me, this is a very welcome addition to Tweetbot as it allows my two most-used iOS apps to better communicate with each other without requiring me to manually move between apps. I can get all the benefits of using an external browser (Facebook sharing, using [bookmarklets](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/bookmarklet\/) ) while still being able to go back to Tweetbot seamlessly.\n\nFor Flickr and Vine users, Tweetbot 2.7 also adds inline previews. Vine’s short videos are shown with a standard iOS video player that has a play\/pause button.\n\nTweetbot 2.7 is a minor, yet useful update for Chrome and 1Password users who have been wishing the app could open links in other browsers. You can find the update on the App Store ( [iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-iphone%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), [iPad](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-ipad%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) ).\n\n[Tweetbot Adds Support For Chrome and 1Password Browsers, Vine and Flick Inline Previews](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-adds-support-for-chrome-and-1password-browsers-vine-and-flick-inline-previews\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for Mac 1.2 Brings Notifications For Specific Users, Vine Previews, UI Tweaks\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-02-20_023514-TB12.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&_2013-02-20_023514-TB12.png)\nTweetbot \n\nTweetbot for Mac, Tapbots’ Twitter client that [I first reviewed in October 2012](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/), has been updated today to version 1.2, which is available on the Mac App Store. Among the notable features of this new version, Tapbots is introducing notifications for specific users, support for inline Flickr and Vine previews, and compliance with the Twitter 1.1 API.\n\n[Announced last year](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/blog\/changes-coming-to-twitter-api), the new Twitter API will force Tweetbot users to upgrade to Tweetbot 1.2 or later by March 5, 2013. After that date, all previous versions of Tweetbot will stop working. For the end user, updating Tweetbot for the new API means Tapbots had to alter some graphical elements of the app: among various changes, your own tweets will no longer be shown with an avatar on the right side of the timeline; profiles can now be opened on Twitter.com; and, you can click on the timestamp in a tweet’s detail view to open that tweet directly in the browser with a single click.\n\nI have to say, in using Tweetbot 1.2 for the past few weeks I have come to like the easier opening of profiles and tweets on the Twitter website, but I’m still getting used to seeing my tweets with my profile picture on the left side. I haven’t noticed other changes that have impacted my usability of the app.\n\nA great addition in Tweetbot 1.2 is the possibility to receive notifications when a specific user tweets. To do so, you can control-click on a user you’re following and choose Enable\/Disable Notifications to receive alerts for new tweets. My wish is that this feature will someday come in the form of *push* notifications to the iPhone and iPad: it would be particularly handy for my workflow to keep the app closed and yet receive notifications for specific users that I care about.[❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-1-2-brings-notifications-for-specific-users-vine-previews-ui-tweaks\/#fn:1)\n\nThere are several changes and fixes that, while subtle, can fix those annoyances that add up over time. Double-clicking the Profile tab now respects the setting for background links in the browser; thumbnail support for Vine and Flickr is consistent with the latest update to the iOS app; you can now add .mp4 files to tweets, GIF uploading has been fixed, and images or video files can be dragged onto the app icon to compose a new tweet; “finally”, accounts can be reordered in the Preferences. As shown in the screenshot above, the Notifications panel in the Settings now comes with more control over the notifications you want to show in Tweetbot’s dock icon and menubar item.\n\nIt’s good to see that Twitter’s API requirements haven’t been a detriment to Tweetbot’s efficiency so far.

In Tweetbot, you can now open the tweet detail view and tap on the timestamp to automatically open the Twitter website in your default browser; in terms of interaction, I like this change because it lets me open tweets in Google Chrome with just one tap.\n\nIn thinking about the update last night, I realized that:\n\n* My team and I use iMessage for daily communication;\n* The majority of URLs we share are Twitter URLs;\n* We all use Tweetbot on iOS and OS X;\n* Easier browser access means easier bookmarklet triggering;\n* [Drafts](http:\/\/agiletortoise.com\/drafts) can access iMessage.\n\nAnd I concluded that:\n\n* I could chain every piece of the puzzle together;\n* Hopefully somebody else will find it useful and adapt the workflow to other similar scenarios.\n\nTherefore, I created a browser bookmarklet, a Python script, and a Drafts action to automate the entire process and demonstrate how you can convert Twitter URLs to `tweetbot:\/\/` URLs and send text from [Pythonista](http:\/\/omz-software.com\/pythonista\/) to Drafts.\n\n[As usual](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/url-scheme\/), I am posting the following workflow as a proof of concept that you can modify and adapt to your needs. For instance, you can change the action that is triggered in Drafts, the [x-success](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/) parameter that will be triggered, or the way Twitter links are converted to Tweetbot-specific URLs.\n\nThe first step is a browser bookmarket that will take the current URL (in our case, most likely a Twitter link opened from Tweetbot) and send it to Pythonista.\n\nHere’s the code:\n\n>   \n```\njavascript:window.location='pythonista:\/\/TweetbotDrafts?action=run&argv='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'&argv='+encodeURIComponent(document.location.href);\n```\n\nAs you can see, we’re launching a Pythonista script called “TweetbotDrafts”, telling the app to run it with two arguments: the webpage’s title and URL. The title isn’t necessary – it is currently turned off in the script – but I included it so you can include it in your workflow if you want (say, to send both a webpage’s title and URL in a message).[1](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/chaining-tweetbot-pythonista-drafts-and-imessage-for-urls\/#fn1)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&image-1361384701.jpeg)\nChrome \n\nThe second step is the Python script itself.\n\n>   \n```\nimport re import sys import urllib import webbrowser import clipboard numArgs = len(sys.argv) if numArgs < 2: url = clipboard.get() else: text = sys.argv[1] url = sys.argv[2] link = re.sub(\"(?Phttps:\/\/.*twitter\\\\.com\/)(?P.+)\/(?P(status|statuses))\/(?P.+)\", \"tweetbot:\/\/\\g\/status\/\\g\", url) encoded = urllib.quote(link, safe='') drafts = 'drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=' + encoded + '&action=iMessageIt' webbrowser.open(drafts)\n```\n\nLine 7 checks how many arguments have been sent: if they’re two, they will be recognized by lines 14-15, if it’s only one, the script will assume it’s something you copied in the system clipboard.\n\nWe want to convert Twitter links to `tweetbot:\/\/` ones, leaving “normal URLs” untouched so you can use the script with any webpage – not just the Twitter website. Using [a regex by our Don Southard](http:\/\/www.dirtdon.com\/?p=1484), we can replace specific portions of a string (the twitter.com URL) with parts of the [Tweetbot URL scheme](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme) that we want to use. Basically, something like this:\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/304079202880212996](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/304079202880212996)\n\nbecomes this:\n\n[tweetbot:\/\/viticci\/status\/304079202880212996](tweetbot:\/\/viticci\/status\/304079202880212996)\n\n…entirely automatically. When someone will receive that link, he\/she can click it to launch that single tweet’s detail view in Tweetbot for Mac or iOS. If the link didn’t need to be converted, it means we launched the bookmarklet (and therefore the script) from a non-Twitter webpage, which won’t need any substitution.\n\nLine 20  [URL-encodes](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Percent-encoding) the link to prepare it for Drafts; line 22 constructs the Drafts URL, calling an “iMessageIt” action. Finally, line 24 launches Drafts, passing along the URL we just processed.\n\nDrafts is the last step, and the one you can personalize the most. I am sending a link via iMessage, but you can create another Drafts URL action to upload the link to Dropbox or Evernote, send it to another app, or [any other service that Drafts supports](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/chaining-multiple-apps-together-with-drafts\/).\n\nMy custom action simply triggers Drafts’ built-in Message action and tells the app to open Tweetbot again after a message is sent. Make sure to call this action “iMessageIt” to make it work with the script above.\n\n>   \n```\ndrafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action=Message&x-success={{tweetbot:\/\/}}\n```\n\nWith this action ready to go, Drafts will receive the link from Pythonista and bring up a Messages panel with the link already filled in. Unfortunately, right now you can’t populate the To: field with specific contacts – meaning: you’ll have to type addresses manually. I wish Greg Pierce will consider the option of letting users specify default recipients for the Messages action in some way.\n\nTo sum up, here’s what the script accomplishes: by leveraging my appreciation for Tweetbot’s easier opening of single tweets, it uses a bookmarklet to grab a webpage’s title \/URL and send it to Pythonista. If the link that was sent is a twitter.com one, Pythonista will process it and turn it into a Tweetbot URL, because I like Tweetbot. Once converted, Pythonista will send the link to Drafts. In receiving the link, Drafts will open a Messages panel to send it to someone; once set, it will go back to Tweetbot, as if nothing happened.\n\nOne last tip: keep in mind that Tweetbot [recently received the option to close a Google Chrome tab](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-adds-support-for-chrome-and-1password-browsers-vine-and-flick-inline-previews\/) that it created, taking you back to the timeline. Right now, my workflow goes back to Tweetbot, but it doesn’t close the tab created in Chrome. If you don’t want to keep that extra tab in Chrome, simply replace the last URL of the Drafts action with `googlechrome:\/\/` and you’ll be able to go back to Tweetbot (while closing the tab) from there.\n\n[Chaining Tweetbot, Pythonista, Drafts, and iMessage for URLs](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/chaining-tweetbot-pythonista-drafts-and-imessage-for-urls\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 2.8 Adds Media Timeline\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-04-22_234743-tb28main_2.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&_2013-04-22_234743-tb28main_2.png)\nTweetbot \n\nEver since its [original release two years ago](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), I’ve always wished Tweetbot could provide filters to separate the standard timeline from a “media” one containing pictures and videos. After the launch of [Twitter’s own photo service](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twitter#Integrated_photo-sharing_service) and rise in popularity of services like Instagram, usage of pictures – either photos or screenshots – among the people I follow has skyrocketed. Apps like TweetGlass (nèe [Quip](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/quip-a-new-ipad-twitter-app-with-a-focus-on-conversations\/) ) succesfully explored the concept of letting users browse “media updates” in a dedicated feed, so why not Tweetbot?\n\nThe latest version of Tapbots’ client, [available today](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), does just that: it adds a media timeline to show only supported images and video tweets (the ones that you’d normally see displayed inline as thumbnails).\n\nTo access the new media timeline, you can scroll at the top of the regular timeline and – both on the iPhone and iPad – hit the media button next to the search bar. In the media timeline, status updates containing pictures or videos will show their respective media fully expanded inline, ready to be tapped to be viewed in full-screen. Imagine a mix of Tweetbot’s existing style and Instagram’s photo feed and you get the idea.\n\nTweets are shown right above the picture\/video they contain, and you can tap the text of a tweet to open the usual tweet detail view – which now displays the amount of faves\/retweets a tweet has received (unfortunately, you can’t tap these to show a list of users who have faved\/retweeted that tweet).\n\nUpon tapping on an image in Tweetbot 2.8, you’ll also notice how the image viewer has been completely redone to act like [its Mac counterpart](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/). Tapping on an image in Tweetbot 2.8 shows the same loading indicator of Tweetbot for Mac (which is good for consistency across platforms) and brings images in the foreground with a delightful animation that is reminiscent of Facebook for iOS’ image viewer, only a bit faster. Like Facebook, you can dismiss images with a vertical swipe (on the iPhone); both on the iPhone and iPad, you can also tap anywhere on the screen to close the modal image viewer. I’m a big fan of Facebook’s swipe-to-close-image implementation, and I’m glad Tweetbot for iPhone now works in the same way (primarily because always reaching out to the Back button in the top left corner [can get tiresome for me](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/iphone-5-review\/) ).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-04-22_233558-tb28ipad.png)\nTweetbot \n\nI only have some minor gripes with the media timeline. In order to keep the same size of tweets across the entire timeline, sometimes longer tweets are cut off, forcing you to open the detail view to read them in full (you can see this [here](https:\/\/90a2cc4b7deb50ba0492-5793e9161196cd023f2e1f1322f2910e.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/2013-04-22_233603-tb28cutoff.PNG) ); you can’t tap on a user’s avatar to go to his\/her timeline; and, you can’t tap & hold on the inline preview – you have to open the image and then tap & hold to bring up the contextual menu.\n\nAnother addition that I’d like to see would be an option to switch to the media timeline from anywhere (not just from a button at the top) while maintaining reading position. I imagine this could be done by adding a tap & hold option to the Timeline tab bar item – but, again, I understand why Tapbots went for a simpler approach.[❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/#fn:1)\n\nOverall, I’m a fan of the new media timeline. It makes scrolling through photos a more relaxed, visual experience that is well distinct from Tweetbot’s more option-rich regular timeline. The new image viewer is fast, smooth, and easy to use; Instagram previews have been fixed; and, obviously, various bug fixes and improvements are awaiting in this release as well.\n\nTweetbot 2.8 is available now on the App Store.\n\n[Tweetbot 2.8 Adds Media Timeline](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/)\n\n# Using Tweetbot Searches to Replace RSS\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-05-23_19-46-11-tbsearch.png)\nSean Korzdorfer shares a Tweetbot tip that I didn’t know about: you can construct complex searches with boolean operators and filters and launch them [with a URL scheme](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme), both on OS X and iOS. And not just regular searches – you can apply a *query* to look for specific keywords inside a Tweetbot search.\n\nBasically, Sean is using Tweetbot searches to replace RSS feeds. By saving searches that filter out RTs, mentions, and tweets in foreign languages, he receives a stream of tweets containing links from a specific set of users. Sean has turned his searches into [Alfred workflows](http:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/) for Tweetbot on the Mac, and I thought I could do the same on iOS.\n\nSure enough, here’s a Launch Center Pro action to launch a Tweetbot search for links (no RTs, no mentions) from users I care about:\n\n>   \n```\ntweetbot:\/\/\/search?query=from%3Amacrumors%20OR%20from%3Averge%20OR%20from%3Adaringfireball%20OR%20from%3Apolygonall%20OR%20from%3Akotaku%20OR%20from%3Amacdrifter_feed%20OR%20from%3Areneritchie%20OR%20from%3Amattalexand%20OR%20from%3Anateboateng%20OR%20from%3Adujkan%20OR%20from%3Amarkgurman%20OR%20from%3Apanzer%20filter%3Alinks%20-filter%3Amentions%20-filter%3Aretweets%20lang%3Aen%20[prompt]\n```\n\nAnd here it is decoded for reading purposes:\n\n>   \n```\ntweetbot:\/\/\/search?query=from:macrumors OR from:verge OR from:daringfireball OR from:polygonall OR from:kotaku OR from:macdrifter_feed OR from:reneritchie OR from:mattalexand OR from:nateboateng OR from:dujkan OR from:markgurman OR from:panzer filter:links -filter:mentions -filter:retweets lang:en [prompt]\n```\n\nThe URL action ends with a `[prompt]` for Launch Center Pro, but that can also be a `[[draft]]` for Drafts. You’re not forced to launch the search URL with a keyword – if you don’t enter anything in the prompt, Tweetbot will display *all* links from the search (which is why you probably don’t want to use Drafts for this, as it can’t launch an action from an empty draft). Also, you can see that the first portion of the URL isn’t percent-encoded, but the one after the `query` parameter is. For this, [Launch Center Pro’s encode\/decode actions](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/launch-center-pro-1-1\/) can come in handy.\n\nI am subscribed to a series of Twitter lists to discover interesting links on a daily basis, but these complex searches have the advantage of filtering out RTs and mentions, providing a cleaner, links-only experience.\n\n[Using Tweetbot Searches to Replace RSS](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/using-tweetbot-searches-to-replace-rss\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for Mac 1.3 Adds Media Timeline, More Tweaks\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-05-30_17-50-36-tb13.png)\nFollowing the [2.8 update released on iOS in April](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/), Tapbots today updated [Tweetbot for Mac](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/mac\/) to version 1.3, which adds various tweaks to the interface as well as the media timeline that debuted on the iPhone and iPad.\n\nTo access the new media timeline, which provides an inline media view of all timelines in Tweetbot, you can hit ⌘F and click on the icon next to the search bar, or, alternatively, choose View > Media Timeline (⌥⌘M with the keyboard). The media timeline retains the same functionality and design that Tapbots first brought to the iPhone; to switch back to the default timeline, you can click another icon next to the search bar or go to View > Default Timeline (⌥⌘T).\n\nComplying with Twitter’s new display guidelines, the tweet detail view now comes with retweet and favorite counters – again, implemented just like in Tweetbot for iOS. And alongside a series of bug fixes and improvements, Tweetbot 1.3 brings a welcome enhancement to profile views: besides Cover Image support, you can now double-click the titlebar on a profile to scroll back to the top. Double-clicking again will scroll a profile’s timeline to the top as well.\n\nTweetbot for Mac 1.3 is [available now on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12).\n\n[Tweetbot for Mac 1.3 Adds Media Timeline, More Tweaks](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-1-3-adds-media-timeline-more-tweaks\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 3 Review: Human After All\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-main.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&_2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-main.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) is, by far, the iPhone app that I use the most on a daily basis. It’s not just that I keep Twitter open essentially all day to check for news, talk to friends, or post GIFs: since I got the first beta of the original Tweetbot [three years ago](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/28367698210), the app has become so ingrained in my workflow that I wouldn’t be able to switch back to any other client that doesn’t have the same capabilities. What started as a moderately advanced take on Twitter clients by Tapbots has evolved with time into a powerful app that spans three platforms and that comes with dozens of unique features and a solid engine that, for me, has no equal. I don’t say it lightly: because of Tweetbot’s feature set, I have been able to reliably communicate with other people (via DM or Mentions), reference tweets for articles, or [build complex workflows](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/convert-twitter-com-urls-to-tweetbot-links\/) that have allowed me to be more efficient, faster, and generally happier with Twitter.\n\nThat’s why I take major changes to Tweetbot’s overall structure and design, such as Tweetbot 3 for iOS 7, very seriously. Tweetbot 3, [released today as a new app sold at $2.99 on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline)  (launch sale), is many things at once: it’s Tapbots’ first foray into the iOS 7 design aesthetic, which marks a radical departure from the small studio’s former visual style; it’s a profound reimagination of Tweetbot’s looks, animations, and sounds, which had gone largely unchanged since 2011; and it’s a confirmation of Tweetbot’s existing feature set with changes aimed at further enhancing the app’s functionality and making room for future additions. It’s iPhone-only, with a new version for iPad coming next.\n\nI have been using Tweetbot 3 every day on my iPhone 5 for the past couple of months. I think that I have a good understanding of the decisions behind the app’s redesign, feature changes, and complete embrace of iOS 7’s visual and hierarchical approach to building interfaces. With version 3.0, Tweetbot, the robotic toy for your Twitter stream, eschews its mechanical roots and graduates to a modern, fluid, and *fun* assistant that, in the process, is still Tweetbot. I wouldn’t be able to go back to the old Tweetbot now, but I also think that getting used to the new app will take some time.\n\n## New Bot\n\nTweetbot 3 is different. The fact that something has changed is immediately clear from the app’s initial walkthrough: what used to be a swipeable gallery of screens is now a carousel of translucent cards that bounce and rotate as you flick them off the screen. As usual, these cards offer a handy summary of Tweetbot’s most peculiar features such as customizable tabs and tap & hold actions.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-cardsintro.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nEven more than first-run quick tips, though, the app’s About screen provides a concise and clever summary of Tapbots’ new focus and philosophy: the young scientist who operated a welding gun to craft the original Tweetbot is replaced by a grown-up version that, Minority Report-style, calculates the proportions of the new app icon on a floating, transparent display. The tone is more serious – futuristic, perhaps – and, if you’ll allow me a manga comparison, it almost feels like going from [Dragon Ball](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Ball) to the [GT saga](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Ball_GT).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-28-32%2520AM-tb3-about.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nAnd yet, even the artwork itself doesn’t tell the whole story: the description of the app does.\n\nThe old Tweetbot used to say:\n\n> Tapbots are utility robots designed and engineered for your iPhone and iPod touch. Our applications are easy to use, focused, and lots of fun. We hope our robots will create the same love for software that we have.  \n\nWhereas this is how Tapbots describe themselves in Tweetbot 3:\n\n> We are a tiny two-person company (sometimes three) that loves creating exceptional apps for iOS and the Mac. Paul codes in Texas and Mark designs in California.  \n\nThe app’s new About screen serves as a declaration of intent from Tapbots: the robots may be gone, but the love for software is still here.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-settings.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\n“Human” is a term that is often overused in the iOS 7 world, but, for Tweetbot 3, it’s absolutely fitting.\n\nThe original Tweetbot, released after much anticipation and a long beta-testing process, was deeply invested in the company’s preference for robots as software utilities: every part of Tweetbot’s interface had been designed trying to imagine how a machine would display a vertical stream of text, switch between tabs, or respond to user interaction with sound. When you swiped horizontally on a tweet, Tweetbot would play a very machine-like sound effect and push the interface to the side with a precise, snappy transition; buttons were shaped as buttons with pressed states and borders; every interaction had been modelled after the idea that Tweetbot was a robot for tweets, and you were in charge of operating it. Tweetbot was a playful appliance and it was gorgeous to look at because it was unique.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-timeline.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nBy comparison, Tweetbot 3 doesn’t look so unique if your judgment of the app is limited to a first impression based on two screenshots of the main timeline. The app makes conspicuous use of white space, avatars are now circular, and icons are thinner.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-28-32%2520AM-tb3-main_comp.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nWhile the basic layout is the same, the old design has been torn away and replaced with a new airy look that puts less focus on buttons and custom UI elements. If you don’t look any closer, you’d almost be disappointed by Tweetbot’s lighter, machine-free approach. Tap on a tweet, however, and you’ll see what’s changed.\n\nTweetbot 3 is all about custom animations, transitions, physics effects, and layers. “We wanted to stay unique and fun”, Tweetbot developer Paul Haddad told me in an email exchange about the new app. “With the new frameworks and tools added in iOS 7 we were able to add that fun factor in by using physics and custom transitions”, he added. This is fairly standard terminology for the iOS 7-savvy user, but, in Tweetbot 3, it has a practial consequence on the user experience that is beneficial to the app.\n\nThe tweet drawer was one of the old Tweetbot’s marquee features in that it enabled users to easily access shortcuts to reply to, retweet, fave, or share a tweet. The problem with the drawer was that, because Tapbots had built a triple tap gesture to quickly act on a tweet without showing the drawer, the app had to understand whether the user had tapped just once or was about to tap more times on the screen to trigger the triple tap behavior. This resulted in a small but perceptible delay in tapping the screen and showing the drawer. It wasn’t a major issue, but it was noticeable.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-contextual.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nIn Tweetbot 3, Tapbots has removed the triple tap gesture and made the tweet drawer the only way to display tweet actions in the main timeline. As a result of the removal, the app doesn’t have to think about the number of taps anymore, as it knows that if you tapped once, you want to open the drawer – which appears immediately after you tap on a tweet. And here’s where Tapbots’ new skills are revealed: when you tap, a tweet turns dark gray and the drawer folds down from “behind” the tweet and into the timeline with a delightful 3D transition that I still can’t stop looking at.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-16%252002-44-29-tweetbot3-drawer.gif)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nWhile the core aspect of the tweet drawer has stayed the same, the fact that it now opens immediately after you tap is a huge improvement in my opinion. I haven’t missed the triple tap actions because the tweet drawer makes it easier to access a wider set of shortcuts; the new animation retains the old app’s idea of “pushing down” tweets below the drawer, but it also reinforces a new kind of physicality that feels less like a robot and more like an object you’re directly manipulating. It’s an abstract idea and it doesn’t come across well enough in screenshots and text descriptions, but it’s there.\n\nTweetbot 3’s superior single-tap recognition is also well demonstrated by the simple act of switching between tabs at the bottom of the screen: in the old Tweetbot, there was a small delay between tapping a tab and viewing its timeline; in Tweetbot 3, that delay is gone and the app changes between tabs instantly. Try the new tweet drawer and tap-switching mechanism in Tweetbot 3, go back to Tweetbot 2, and the app will feel slow and clunky. A robot, indeed.\n\nEvery part of Tweetbot has been refreshed and, in my tests, I couldn’t find a single pixel that had been ported over from the old app. From the main timeline and borderless buttons to table views (now edge-to-edge) and the status bar (white and unified with the title bar), everything in Tweetbot 3 is at the same time new and familiar.\n\nI have been thinking deeply about this: Tweetbot 3 still works like the old Tweetbot did, but the things that have changed – they have changed for the better. The app has lost two features (that I could find) in the transition to iOS 7 [❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:1), and, in the process of applying a new design language to it, Tapbots enhanced the fundamentals of Tweetbot to make the app faster and more fluid. It would be easy to form an opinion after five minutes of testing. For Tweetbot 3, I believe that it’s important to consider the tiniest details and every feature to understand how the new version will result in an improved experience on a daily basis.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe custom physics engine developed by Paul Haddad makes Tweetbot feel more natural and flexible. Take, for instance, the app’s new tap & hold menu: traditionally, tapping & holding a tweet or a URL would have slightly dimmed the background of the app and brought up a glossy contextual menu with buttons to, say, copy a tweet or a link to it. In Tweetbot 3, this is what happens when you tap & hold a tweet:\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-16%252003-50-57-tweetbot3-taphold.gif)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nThe main view is pushed in the background and blurred, and the contextual menu comes up from the bottom with simpler white buttons and a gray Cancel button that bounces against the main menu as it fully comes into view. Overall, the animation is slightly slower than Tweetbot 2, but it feels right at home on iOS 7.\n\nSomething that always struck me as unique to the old Tweetbot was how fun it was to look at the app’s button-y look or custom pull to refresh spinner, and how that fun didn’t grow old over time. It always felt new and whimsical…until iOS 7 came around and it started feeling oddly out of place on the new OS. Tweetbot 3 feels good on iOS 7, and, more importantly, it retains the fun factor – it’s just used in other areas, and I believe with equal craftsmanship and willingness to delightfully impress and entertain the user.\n\nIn Tweetbot 2, you could tap & hold the last two items in the tab bar to show a popup menu to switch between other tabs and assign them to the bar bar. It was a sweet, fun, efficient alternative to Apple’s default tab customization UI, and it worked well with Tweetbot’s design.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-tabs.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nIn Tweetbot 3, the feature is still there, and it still works in the same way, but it is animated differently: when you tap & hold a customizable tab, circular icons spring into view, tied together by Haddad’s engine that makes them bounce and stop after they’ve been revealed. With your finger still down on the tab, swipe up and down anywhere on the screen and tabs will be quickly highlighted in blue with a subtle fade in\/out effect that is gorgeous to look at. The overall transition speed was slightly faster in Tweetbot 2, but once I got used to the new app’s physics and highlight effect and the fact that you can swipe anywhere on the screen to activate a tab, the old Tweetbot’s menu felt overly robotic.\n\nTweetbot 3’s strongest demonstration of physics, though, is in the new picture viewer. In terms of functionality, it’s unchanged from Tweetbot 2: thumbnails shown in the timeline can be tapped to enlarge a picture, which can be tapped to dismiss the preview and return to the timeline. In Tweetbot 3, however, the floating preview (which, as you can guess, blurs the content behind it) is bound by some form of gravity to the tweet it belongs to, so, if you don’t flick the picture away with enough speed, it’ll bounce back and return to the original position. Pictures can be flicked away in any direction, and they also “fly away” differently depending on how fast you throw them away with your finger. It feels like a mini-game within Tweetbot.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-falloff.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nWhen [Rene Ritchie wrote about the gamification of the iOS 7 interface](http:\/\/www.imore.com\/ios-7-and-continuing-gamification-interface), I think that something like Tweetbot 3’s picture viewer is exactly what he meant: natural, perhaps even a bit quirky, but undeniably fun and obvious when you get it.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-pictap.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nOne more thing about inline pictures: like iOS 7, Tweetbot is defined by its very own hierarchy of layers and levels of interface that are progressively shown to users as they interact with an app. If you tap & hold on a picture that has been enlarged from the timeline, you’ll see that, unlike Tweetbot 2, the first layer (timeline) will be more blurred and pushed back further than the picture that’s now also blurred and pushed back to show a contextual menu as Layer 1. It’s not something that will directly increase your productivity in Tweetbot, but it is a detail that shows how Tapbots has deeply considered their approach to iOS 7 and chosen to stack layers of the user interface on top of each other.\n\nGiven the aforementioned changes to the app’s structure and layout, it only makes sense that tabs are now independent from each other, with their respective nested levels and views no longer taking over the whole app. In practical terms, this means that every tab can open its own web view or navigate into a user’s profile without preventing you from switching to other tabs.\n\nIn the old Tweetbot, when you followed a link in a tweet, a web view would open, forcing you to either read the page and share it, or go back to the timeline. Similarly, tapping on a user’s profile would show a new set of tabs at the bottom to view all tweets from that user, mentions, faved tweets, and lists; to make things more confusing, you could also view all tweets from a user by tapping on “Tweets”, which would show a full-screen list of all tweets in reverse chronological order. The entire navigation stack has been changed in Tweetbot 3.\n\nNow, whenever you follow a link, a web view will be opened and confined to the tab it’s been launched from. If you open a link from your timeline, you can switch to the Mentions tab and do something else; if you open a link from a DM, you can go back to the timeline and read tweets while the page is loading.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-webview.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nThis change to the app’s navigation makes for an incredibly more convenient workflow for people who, like me, deal with links every day and found it cumbersome to be forced to wait for a page to load, act on it, then close it. The “multitasking” experience inside Tweetbot is much improved because of this change and, in comparison, the old app’s way of handling web views looks silly now. For me, this has been particularly handy when receiving DMs: I get a lot of direct messages every day, and with Tweetbot 3 I’m no longer forced to close a webpage I’m reading if I have to reply to a DM immediately.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I’d say that it’d be cool to show an indicator for an open web view in the tab bar: while the active tab is highlighted in blue and there’s the usual blue dot for new tweets, there’s no way to tell whether a tab has an open web view unless you switch to it.\n\nFor user profiles, Jardine and Haddad have simplifed and enhanced the app’s functionality with an elegant solution. A user profile now shows avatar and cover photo at the top, but, unlike Tweetbot 2, name, username, and bio are overlaid on top of the cover photo, which is blurred in the background; swipe down and the text is dimmed, revealing the cover photo. If you don’t care about this trick, you can just tap both photos to view them. But this isn’t the main enhancement I’m excited about.\n\nAt the bottom of a user profile, you’ll see that there are no standalone tabs for navigation anymore; tap Tweets, and the app navigates into a view that shows a segmented control at the top to switch between that user’s Tweets, Mentions, and Faves; while viewing these, you can freely switch back to any other tab in the app.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-40-58%2520AM-tb3-profiles.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nProfiles now show Recent Photos: gathered from your own tweets and retweets, Tweetbot 3 can’t load all photos from your profile, and, in my tests, it generally displayed between 6 and 9 recent photos, but sometimes even less (a limitation that I believe is part of the Twitter API). While this is a nice addition, the fact that it’s not a full grid of all media uploads doesn’t make it much useful to me – and, worse, there is no way to view the original tweet associated with a photo to have more context. Recent Photos feels half-baked right now, and I would love to see Tapbots exploring this idea further in the future.\n\nWith Tweetbot’s new structure, the ability to load a Twitter list in the main timeline is gone from version 3.0. Lists get their own tab now, and, while I’m sure that many will miss what was one of Tweetbot’s most unique features, I believe that the trade-off for increased navigation and multitasking is worth it.\n\nAnother addition that I really like is waking up each morning to new tweets already waiting for me in Tweetbot. Thanks to iOS 7’s Background App Refresh, Tweetbot 3.0 can fetch tweets in the background while maintaining your scrolling position; launch the app, and you’ll see blue dot indicators for new tweets without having to wait for a refresh. It’s a minor feature, but it’s handy and I don’t want to live without it anymore.\n\n## Single Tweets and Compose\n\nAs I mentioned above, the swipe from left gesture has been removed, leaving room for a swipe from right that opens a tweet’s Detail view, which has been completely redesigned in Tweetbot 3.\n\nIn the new app, the Detail view is dark and it shows additional buttons to view people who faved or retweeted a specific tweet. For those who need their daily ego boost in the form of fave and retweet counters, this addition is welcome. Replies and conversations are shown above and below the tweet and the app no longer displays attachments in a separate box for tweets with pictures, adopting a beautiful inline visualization instead.[❲2❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:2) As a result, tweets now display more information, gestures have been simplified, and inline pictures get the treatment they deserve.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-28-32%2520AM-tb3-pic_comp.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nI’m still not sure on how I feel about the dark detail view and the gesture to open it. In Tweetbot 2, swiping to the left would quickly switch from the timeline to the Detail view with a seameless transition accompanied by a sound effect. In Tweetbot 3, as you swipe left an icon with three dots is progressively revealed next to a tweet and, if you keep swiping, the entire cell is pushed to the side by a color block, which then disappers to show the Detail view. I was a fan of the old Tweetbot’s transition, and I think that the new one feels unfinished, unnecessary, and slow. In the Detail view, there is a lot of contrast between the dark background of the tweet and the white tab bar at the bottom, something that is exacerbated by tweets that have an inline picture and therefore push buttons to the bottom of the screen. The tab bar’s design was changed in the final betas of the app, and it’s possible that, with time, Tapbots’ decision will grow on me.\n\nAn aspect of tweets with dark background that I like is how they show up when replying to someone. In Tweetbot 2, when you hit the Reply button and wanted to see the tweet you were replying to, you had to swipe down on the Compose area; in Tweetbot 3, when you hit Reply in the tweet drawer and the Compose screen comes up, the previously selected tweet (or conversation) appears immediately below the text field you’ll type into. While the tweet doesn’t appear at the exact same vertical position after the Compose transition has completed, this new UI has a nice continuity between the timeline and the Compose screen that increases the context of a Reply. Extra points to Tapbots for choosing the iOS 7 dark keyboard instead of the default light one; in my opinion (and [The Doctor agrees with me](https:\/\/twitter.com\/drdrang\/status\/381828686883717120) ), the dark keyboard offers more contrast, key legibility, and, overall, it’s more usable than the light keyboard. The fact that it fits better with Tweetbot’s dark gray color for selected tweets also helps.\n\nOne of Tweetbot 3’s minor touches that I feel deserves its own dedicated paragraph is “syntax” highlighting in the Compose screen. Thanks to iOS 7’s new APIs for text detection and layouts, Tweetbot 3 can turn a link blue or a hashtag gray directly when composing a tweet, and not just after the fact when viewing the tweet in the timeline. Try it yourself: copy a link, create a new tweet, paste the link, and it’ll be recognized by iOS 7 and turned blue immediately; same for usernames and hashtags (try with). There are some bugs with scrolling in the Compose area unfortunately [❲3❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:3), but, in general, highlighting bits of text recognized as special by Twitter helps creating a more consistent, discernible writing experience that’s far superior to Tweetbot 2.\n\n## The Little Things\n\nIt would be strange to have a new version of Tweetbot that doesn’t come with charming details and little touches we’re used to seeing from Tapbots. Thankfully, Tweetbot 3 retains all the capabilities that made Tweetbot a powerful Twitter client and adds some new things that, in the beta, stood out to me. As usual with my reviews, here’s a list of all the little things I noticed in no particular order of importance.\n\n* Saved drafts are now shown with a blue page curl in the Compose screen which quickly animates soon after you hit the Compose button from the timeline. Tap it, and a list of drafts comes up in full-screen. You can swipe to delete drafts or tap one to put it in the Compose screen again.\n* The About screen supports iOS 7’s new parallax effect. Try it.\n* The “Select an Account” screen fades into view (blurring the content below) with a sweet animation that makes avatars bounce off the left edge of the screen.\n* When you remove an attached photo from the Compose view, the thumbnail falls off the screen. Same for modal URL dialogs (such as iTunes links that ask you to leave Tweetbot) when you hit Cancel on them.\n* The app shows a blue checkmark next to profile pictures of Verified users, in case you need to remember that they’re important. In the beta, it also showed a blue bot next to the avatars of Paul Haddad and Mark Jardine.\n* Tweetbot 3 supports iOS 7’s system-wide Dynamic Type to tweak text size. If you want to make Tweetbot’s text really huge, you can in the Settings app.\n* The animation for when you tap into the search bar at the top is one of my favorites in Tweetbot 3. The new auto-complete bar for usernames and hashtags is also a contestant, though.\n* You can now email a URL directly from a web view. A sweet touch: the URL is inserted in the body of the message alongside a link to the original tweet.\n* If you tap & hold a long URL in the timeline, the contextual menu will intelligently resize the URL’s text to make it smaller so that you’ll be able to read the full URL without cut-off parts.\n\nA word on the new sounds.\n\nBesides a strong visual personality, Tweetbot has always had a prominent aural identity in the form of sound effects created by Tapbots. Tweetbot 3 replaces all of the app’s sounds with new versions that are less “mechanical” and somewhat more natural and joyful. I like them – especially the new pull to refresh one – but I’ll save my final opinion for the future as the new sound set was added in the last beta before App Store submission. Something that I have noticed is that the app no longer plays a sound when switching between tabs or tapping the back button or swiping a tweet to open the Detail view – and I’m not sure I like this change.\n\n## Human After All\n\n> “I don’t want to say we are moving away from the robot metaphor just yet. It really works best with our more utilitarian apps and so only time will tell what happens on that front. As far as Tweetbot goes, we wanted to shake things up a bit. Paul and I always talked about potentially building another Twitter client that was visually very clean and focused more on content and less on the UI. Token caps obviously killed that idea, but iOS 7 gave us a chance to pursue that idea. That’s not to say that Tweetbot 3 is a completely different app with the same name. Tweetbot 3 feels like a hugely upgraded version of Tweetbot. The functionality and soul of Tweetbot is still there and I think that’s what is most important.” – Mark Jardine  \n\nTrue to the About screen, Tweetbot 3 is an exceptional Twitter client and it doesn’t feel like a robot. With iOS 7, the robot metaphor and heavy interface is gone from Tweetbot, leaving Tapbots with a powerful app that’s been redesigned with color and depth in mind, augmenting animations and transitions to make the app feel unique and fun in a new way.\n\nFor me, Tweetbot’s feature set is still unparallaled and the additions that have been brought to version 3.0 make the app even faster and more reliable when it comes to loading timeline gaps, opening web views, or using [the URL scheme](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme). Tweetbot 3 is the most powerful Twitter client I have on my iPhone.\n\nIf you don’t like iOS 7, I don’t think that you’ll like the new Tweetbot. While the original Tweetbot was, in many ways, a departure from the default\/Tweetie look of most Twitter clients in 2011, Tweetbot 3 is very much in line with the current design language of iOS 7. The old Tweetbot was the culmination of Tapbots’ years of experience with utility robots applied to a Twitter client; Tweetbot 3 is a new start for the company, which has to prove they can still make fantastic utilities that are easy to use and powerful, fun and packed with features.\n\nTweetbot 3 doesn’t come with breakthrough new functionalities, which, according to Tapbots, will follow with future updates. The app’s sharing department could use some additions (there are no new supported apps\/browsers and Pocket doesn’t use the new SDK to handle user authentication) [❲4❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:4) and tweets that match mute filters aren’t automatically removed from the timeline after you create a filter. Tapbots wanted to get the app ready for iOS 7 first, then iterate on the product to add new features that will be made possible by iOS 7. I can understand this decision, and I have absolutely no problem in paying $2.99 again for an app that I have been using several hours each day for the past two years.\n\nTweetbot 3 isn’t a Twitter client that adopts Apple’s default new iOS 7 look without making its own adjustments to the interface and feature set: Tweetbot 3 is already full of subtle and more visible details that contribute to giving the app a very peculiar feel and flow. The animations and transitions that Haddad and Jardine implemented are elegant, apt, and playful; the core features that have been changed, such as web views in tabs and text highlighting in the Compose screen, make for a more flexible Tweetbot that outclasses the rigidity of Tweetbot 2. Tweetbot 3 is a better app because of its layout and design changes.\n\nA lot will be written today about Tweetbot’s new design and Tapbots’ adherence to [iOS 7’s principles of content, color, context, and clarity](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/living-with-ios-7\/). Tweetbot 3 is a fantastic iOS 7 app; its new design, animations, and navigation improvements will be instrumental to Tweetbot’s future on the platform.\n\n[Tweetbot](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) still has personality. It’s just grown up.\n\n[Tweetbot 3 Review: Human After All](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Workflow: Upload and Share Dropbox Text Files\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1383668489-2013-11-05_05.21.14_00.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&_1383668489-2013-11-05_05.21.14_00.png)\nTweetbot workflow \n\nIn [Tweetbot 3](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/), Tapbots removed the ability to post tweets longer than 140 characters using built-in services for text upload. While I understand that it wasn’t one of Tweetbot’s most used features, its removal got me thinking: would it be possible to replicate the feature using Dropbox and plain text files in an automated iOS workflow? I came up with a solution that requires [Launch Center Pro](http:\/\/contrast.co\/launch-center-pro\/) and [Drafts](http:\/\/agiletortoise.com\/drafts\/), and I’m quite happy with it.\n\n## Short Version\n\nThis is a workflow to create, share, and tweet a Dropbox text file with [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/). It requires Launch Center Pro and Drafts, both with access to your Dropbox account. It also requires Tweetbot to be installed (either version 2 or 3).\n\n## Workflow\n\nMy goal was to create a single chain of actions that would let me type the name of a text file and its contents, and that would then upload it to Dropbox, make it shareable, get the public URL, and create a new tweet in Tweetbot for me. I don’t normally need to tweet more than 140 characters, but there are times when I want to, say, share a code snippet and I don’t want to jump between apps and tap 20 different buttons to do it. Once triggered in Launch Center Pro, my workflow only asks for a file name and text, removing all further user interaction until it reaches Tweetbot, where a shareable link to a Dropbox text file is displayed, ready to be tweeted.\n\nThe first piece of the workflow is a Launch Center Pro action that opens Drafts to create a new draft with a title and some text. In Launch Center Pro, two separate `prompt` dialogs ask for a file name and document text, which are then sent to Drafts, automatically running a Drafts action.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1383668537-2013-11-05_05.22.10_00.png)\nTweetbot workflow \n\nThis Launch Center Pro action isn’t needed because you could just launch Drafts and type the name and text of your file there, keeping in mind to separate them with an empty line. However, Launch Center Pro makes it clear that you need to enter these two bits of information thanks to its multiple dialogs.\n\nWhen Drafts receives the text, it automatically triggers an action called “New File” that’s used, as the name suggests, to create a new text file in your Dropbox account. Because it is [a native Dropbox action in Drafts](http:\/\/agiletortoise.com\/support\/drafts\/dropbox_actions.html), we can use the app’s tags and built-in options to create the text file just like we want it: “First Line” is used for the file name, write mode is “create”, and the `[[body]]` tag (all text except the first line) is used in the Template field. A text file with the draft’s first line as name will be created in a specific folder in your Dropbox account; personally, I like to keep these shared files under \/Apps\/Drafts\/Shared so I can easily review them later.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1383668652-2013-11-05_05.24.05_00.png)\nhttps:\/\/313e5987718b346aaf83-f5e825270f29a84f7881423410384342.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/1383668652-2013-11-05_05.24.05_00.png Tweetbot workflow \n\nWith the file on Dropbox, it’s time to get down to business. Take a look at what the main action (called “DropShare”) looks like:\n\n>   \n```\ndrafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action={{New File}}&x-success={{launchpro:\/\/?url=tweetbot%3A%2F%2Fviticci%2Fpost%3Ftext%3D%5Bdropbox%3AApps%2FDrafts%2FShared%2F[[title]].txt%5D}}\n```\n\nThats’ a lot of encoding that you don’t need to know about, but let me explain. Essentially, we’re telling Drafts to:\n\n1. Take the received text and make a new text file with it;\n2. Upon success, use the Launch Center Pro URL scheme to launch Tweetbot;\n3. When launching Tweetbot, mix Launch Center Pro and Drafts tags for file path and file name.\n\nSteps 2 and 3 are the real winners here, as they rely on [Launch Center Pro’s new URL scheme launcher](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/launch-center-pro-2-0-review\/#urlschemeenhancements) to automate the process of fetching a file’s link from Dropbox. Perhaps taking a look at the decoded URL scheme will clarify what’s going on:\n\n>   \n```\nlaunchpro:\/\/?url=tweetbot:\/\/viticci\/post?text=[dropbox:Apps\/Drafts\/Shared\/[[title]].txt]\n```\n\nDrafts opens Launch Center Pro, which is told to open Tweetbot and prepare a new tweet that contains a link to the just-created Dropbox text file. Let’s focus on a specific part of the URL scheme:\n\n>   \n```\n[dropbox:Apps\/Drafts\/Shared\/[[title]].txt]\n```\n\nThis is [Launch Center Pro’s tag for accessing a specific Dropbox file](http:\/\/help.contrast.co\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/200436178-The-dropbox-Tag) and generating a shareable URL for it. The file path is hardcoded into the URL, but the file name – which is always changing – is dynamically generated by Drafts’ `[[title]]` tag, which is expanded by Drafts before opening Launch Center Pro. Launch Center Pro doesn’t know where to look on its own – it just knows that it can load a file path and point to a specific file; fortunately, Drafts can tell Launch Center Pro what the name of the file is, so that a public link to it can be generated and sent to Tweetbot.\n\nTo launch Tweetbot in your account, make sure to replace “viticci” in the Drafts ation’s URL scheme with your Twitter username. Once in Tweetbot, the Compose screen will open, showing the public link to the file you just uploaded, ready to be tweeted.\n\nIf you’ve set up everything correctly, the workflow should take a few seconds to run (depending on your Internet connection) and “just work” by automatically chaining all apps and services together. It’s not perfect, but I’ve been using it for the past few weeks to generate and tweet links to text files and it’s been working well for me. If you have feedback or ideas for improvements, [let me know](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci).\n\n[Tweetbot Workflow: Upload and Share Dropbox Text Files](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/tweetbot-workflow-upload-and-share-dropbox-text-files\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 3.1 Brings Text Size Controls, Timeline Switcher, Quick Actions\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1384130721-2013-11-11-at-01-44-53-TB31_main.png)\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) for iPhone [may have grown up](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/), but it hasn’t forgotten about the features and design decisions that made it a powerful and popular Twitter client among iOS users for the past two years. Tweetbot 3.1, [available today on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), improves upon last month’s major release by bringing back some old features of Tweetbot 2.x and introducing new ones, always taking advantage of iOS 7’s design and structure in interesting ways.\n\n### Timeline Switcher\n\nThe possibility to turn the main timeline tab into a Twitter list has always been one of Tweetbot’s unique features. Here’s how I described it in [my review of Tweetbot 1.0](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/) two years ago:\n\n> Let’s say I want to temporarily switch to a timeline based on a list collecting people that tweet about RIM: I tap on the timeline button, select the list, and there my main timeline is replaced by the RIM folks. I can go back at any time, choose lists — even create new ones and add users to them thanks to Tweetbot’s full list management. Other Twitter clients in the past tried to play around with this concept of turning lists into timelines, but none of them got close to today’s implementation in Tweetbot. It’s simple, fun, and adds value to my productivity.  \n\n(I can’t remember why I used [RIM](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BlackBerry_Ltd) as an example. I’m going to retroactively state it was a joke.)\n\nThe timeline switcher had to be cut to ship Tweetbot 3.0, but it’s back in version 3.1 with a new design that matches Tweetbot’s lighter new style. To activate the switcher, tap & hold the “Timeline” text in the title bar of the Timeline tab: a translucent popup will fall off the top of screen, quickly springing back to show you lists you can view in the timeline tab (either because you’ve created those lists or subscribed to them). Once you’re in a list, you can tap & hold again at any time to bring up the switcher and go back to the timeline. Like the old app, Tweetbot 3.1 keeps separate scrolling positions for your timeline and lists; if you’re not seeing all your lists in the popup, it’s because you have to *scroll it*.\n\nI don’t use lists much, but I’m glad the switcher is back. I am subscribed to a bunch of lists and created some for myself – I tend to open an “Apple News” list every couple of days, and my “Games” one every morning. The timeline switcher makes it easier to open lists and it fits with Tweetbot 3’s design.\n\n### Text Size Controls\n\nFor the release of version 3.0, Tapbots decided to eschew in-app text size controls to embrace Dynamic Type, an iOS 7 feature that controls the size of text at a system-wide level in every app on your device that supports it. While I liked the convenience of Dynamic Type (I can set font size once and forget about it), several users didn’t like the fact that there were no options to make Tweetbot’s text look different than other iOS 7 apps. That’s the trade-off with Dynamic Type: unless a developer implements a fallback option for users who don’t like it, you’ll be stuck with having the same font size in all your apps.\n\nWith Tweetbot 3.1, you can turn off Dynamic Type and choose your favorite text size for the app. Available in the app’s Settings under Display, the new text size controls mostly mimic Apple’s default sizes but they don’t depend on it.\n\nThere’s also a handy Tweet Preview box at the top of the screen to show you what a tweet would look like with the current text size settings. There are nine size points to choose from, which should be enough for most users who don’t want Dynamic Type.\n\n### Quick Actions\n\nI wasn’t the biggest fan of Tweetbot 3’s gesture to open a tweet’s detail view:\n\n> I’m still not sure on how I feel about the dark detail view and the gesture to open it. In Tweetbot 2, swiping to the left would quickly switch from the timeline to the Detail view with a seameless transition accompanied by a sound effect. In Tweetbot 3, as you swipe left an icon with three dots is progressively revealed next to a tweet and, if you keep swiping, the entire cell is pushed to the side by a color block, which then disappers to show the Detail view. I was a fan of the old Tweetbot’s transition, and I think that the new one feels unfinished, unnecessary, and slow.  \n\nTapbots’ choice makes more sense now that Tweetbot comes with configurable quick actions through a right swipe that is designed after the left swipe of Tweetbot 3.0.\n\nIn the new version, you can quickly swipe a tweet to the right to reply to it. As you swipe quickly, a reply button appears on the left and the tweet cell is pushed to the right – just like the three dots and the detail view in Tweetbot 3.0. If you reply to tweets often, this is a nice time-saving addition.\n\nA quick visit to the Settings reveals, however, an option for “short right swipe” that can be configured to quickly faving or retweeting a tweet (with inline feedback as you do so). Essentially, Tapbots has built two quick actions into a single swipe gesture: the first one, quick reply, is the default “fast” one, whereas the custom action is a deliberate option in that you have to intentionally perform a short swipe to activate it.\n\nIt’s a clever implementation: in apps like [Mailbox](http:\/\/www.mailboxapp.com\/) and [Dispatch](http:\/\/www.dispatchapp.net\/), there is a certain level of awkwardness when you have to perform a swipe long enough to trigger an action that’s bound to the length of the swipe. In Tweetbot 3.1, the long swipe doesn’t need to be looked after – it’s the one you quickly perform on a tweet you want to reply to. If you want to fave or RT, there is enough distance between the activation zone for quick swipe and normal swipe to ensure a smooth experience. I didn’t like this gesture initially, so I’d suggest giving it some time.\n\nI feel like there’s an untapped potential for quick swipes. Besides the obvious quick reply, fave, and RT shortcuts, it’d be nice to have sharing options available as quick actions – I’m thinking of stuff like Mail and Messages sharing, and perhaps integration with bookmarking services too. Tweetbot has always been about being more productive and efficient in the timeline, so more quick actions would make sense.\n\n### Other Changes\n\nThere are other minor changes in Tweetbot 3.1 worth a mention as well.\n\nIf you don’t like round avatars and want to go back to the old days, you can activate square avatars in the Settings. I don’t like them, but I guess some people will always be nostalgic.\n\nAlongside bug fixes, conversations can now be emailed or shared through Storify again, and a “Last tweet x minutes ago” status is back under a user’s profile. In timelines, the “Retweeted by” text string has been removed, leaving room for just the icon and username in retweets.\n\nTweetbot 3.1 is an iterative udpate that re-introduces old features and quick actions that are useful and show potential for futher development in the future. You can [get the update on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 3.1 Brings Text Size Controls, Timeline Switcher, Quick Actions](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-1-brings-text-size-controls-timeline-switcher-quick-actions\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 3.2 Brings Night Theme, Account Reordering and Quick Switching\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1385516971-2013-11-27_02.49.05_02.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&_1385516971-2013-11-27_02.49.05_02.png)\nTweetbot 3.2 \n\nAfter a [3.1 update](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-1-brings-text-size-controls-timeline-switcher-quick-actions\/) that added text size controls, timeline switching options, and quick actions, Tapbots are back today with a second major update to [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) that brings a night theme, account reordering and quick switching, plus various bug fixes.\n\nOne of the most requested features since the [3.0 release](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/), Tweetbot’s night theme has been designed to work well with the app’s layers, contextual menus, and typography that features syntax highlighting for usernames and links. The app doesn’t simply switch from white to a black background – the entire color scheme changes to show highlights in white or blue on a dark gray background, and the background itself has multiple variations of the same dark hue to indicate interaction and layers.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1385516977-2013-11-27_02.49.05_00.png)\nTweetbot 3.2 \n\nEvery small piece of the UI has been updated for the night theme – from the tapped status of buttons to red “Unfollow” buttons and the color of chat bubbles in the DM view. It’s elegant, easier on the eye, and it looks good even if you’re not reading your timeline at night.\n\nThere are three ways to activate the night theme: the first, *fun* one is to flick with two fingers down on the screen to turn the white theme off and enter night mode (like a light switch – and there’s an associated sound effect); to turn the default theme back on, swipe up with two fingers. If you’re not a fan of gestures, you can open the Settings and either manually pick a theme or let Tweetbot decide based on a display brightness threshold (meant for users who rely on Auto Brightness). Honestly, I’m pretty happy with the gesture and I think that the best part of the setting is the animation of the cell when you turn “Switch Automatically” on and off.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1385516979-2013-11-27_02.49.05_01.png)\nTweetbot 3.2 \n\nIn version 3.2, Tweetbot gets some welcome account-related improvements as well. You can now reorder accounts by opening the “Select an Account” view and tapping & holding to drag and reorder accounts; if you want to quickly move across accounts, you can either swipe the title bar to the right to change timelines or tap & hold an avatar in the upper left corner and then swipe to change account.\n\nI’m glad to see that Tapbots has quickly iterated on Tweetbot and improved aspects that were reported by users after the first release. Tweetbot 3.2 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 3.2 Brings Night Theme, Account Reordering and Quick Switching](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-2-brings-night-theme-account-reordering-and-quick-switching\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 3.3 Adds Avenir Font Option, Large Thumbnails\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1394465541-2014-03-10-at-16-32-00-tb33.jpeg)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&_1394465541-2014-03-10-at-16-32-00-tb33.jpeg)\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), Tapbots’ Twitter client for iPhone that was [relaunched](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/) in October for iOS 7, has been updated today with new display options and the possibility to remove tweets that match a filter.\n\nFor the past few months, Tapbots has been working on improvements to Tweetbot’s presentation and text size controls, adding new settings in [version 3.1](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-1-brings-text-size-controls-timeline-switcher-quick-actions\/) and a [night theme in 3.2](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-2-brings-night-theme-account-reordering-and-quick-switching\/) alongside additions to account management and reordering. In today’s update, Tweetbot gets a new font option in the Preferences to enable Avenir as the app’s primary typeface, as well as a new setting to enlarge thumbnails in the timeline. The latter makes Tweetbot more akin to the official Twitter app for iPhone in that it displays large photos (and app icon previews for iTunes links) that give a better idea of a media item inline without having to show the tweet detail view.\n\nJust like Tweetbot for Mac, Tweetbot for iPhone can now remove tweets that match a mute filter as soon as the filter is added. Through a dialog box, the app will offer to remove matching tweets that have already been loaded in the timeline. The option is particularly welcome if you, for instance, wake up in the morning and realize you don’t want to scroll through hundreds of tweets about an event that happened overnight.\n\nTweetbot 3.3 further refines Tapbots’ vision for Tweetbot 3 on the iPhone, and it’s [available now on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 3.3 Adds Avenir Font Option, Large Thumbnails](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-3-adds-avenir-font-option-large-thumbnails\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for Mac Updated with Large Thumbnails Option, Three-Finger Gesture Fix\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1395420883-Screen%2520Shot%25202014-03-21%2520at%252005.47.40%2520PM.png)\n[Tweetbot for Mac](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/mac\/), Tapbots’ desktop version of its popular Twitter client, was updated last night with support for a new large thumbnail option in the timeline, a refreshed design of inline image previews, and a fix for three-finger gestures.\n\nFollowing [Tweetbot 3.3 for iPhone](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-3-adds-avenir-font-option-large-thumbnails\/), Tweetbot 1.5 for Mac adds large thumbnails as an option in the app’s Preferences. Large thumbnails retain the capability of being right-clicked to access a contextual menu, and they bring a slightly redesigned preview in the tweet detail view as well. In my tests, loading large thumbnails with proper resolution required deleting Tweetbot’s account cache under Preferences > Account.\n\nFor users who enabled three-finger navigation gestures on their Macs, Tweetbot will now respect that setting and allow to swipe with three fingers to navigate back and forth between tweets, timelines, and other views of the app.\n\nTweetbot for Mac is available at [$19.99 on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).

When composing tweet, you can attach multiple images (up to four) simply by adding them to a tweet, and they will show up as a stack of photos in the compose box. You can tap the stack to reveal all the photos you’re including in a tweet, tapping on a single one to get a bigger preview and a remove button. The implementation is easy to use and well done; if I had to nitpick, I’d say that it would be nice to select four images from the image library at once, without having to perform the action four times.\n\nUntil Twitter enables the feature, however, multiple photos won’t show up in search or a streaming timeline – which is the reason why you won’t see an indicator for multiple photos until you open an individual tweet.\n\nA minor change that I like is the possibility of viewing corresponding tweets for recent images from a Twitter user. On a user’s profile view, tap an image, and Tweetbot will show the tweet that contained that photo, allowing you to reopen the tweet.

Tweets with multiple images show a carousel in their detail views, and, on OS X, you can click on the image indicators to move across pictures manually. Both on iOS and OS X, Tweetbot still doesn’t support Twitter’s animated GIFs, [introduced by the company](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/twitter-adds-support-for-animated-gifs-on-web-android-and-iphone\/) in June.\n\nTweetbot for Mac 1.6 is [available on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot for Mac Updated with Support for Multiple Twitter Images](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-updated-with-support-for-multiple-twitter-images\/)\n\n# Twitter Clients in 2014: An Exploration of Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and Twitter for iOS\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Photo-2014-12-08-02-47.jpg)\nTwitter clients used to be a [UI design playground](http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2009\/04\/twitter_clients_playground). The growing popularity of Twitter, an open API, and the [rapid takeoff](http:\/\/www.apple.com\/pr\/library\/2009\/04\/24Apples-Revolutionary-App-Store-Downloads-Top-One-Billion-in-Just-Nine-Months.html) of the App Store contributed to the creation of a defining genre of mobile software in 2009 and 2010: the Twitter client for iPhone. In the golden days of third-party Twitter apps, a good new client would come out at least every month, with several developers pitching their own ideas for what was meant to be a mobile-first communication network.\n\niPhone apps and the Twitter API were a perfect match five years ago. Twitter made sense as a social network in your pocket; Apple’s iPhone OS and [newly launched App Store](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/pr\/library\/2008\/07\/14iPhone-App-Store-Downloads-Top-10-Million-in-First-Weekend.html) made that a reality. As a user, there was little friction in trying multiple Twitter clients: because Twitter data was always “in the cloud”, changing clients was like choosing a different outfit each day. The core Twitter experience would always be the same; the design and preferences around it would differ from client to client.\n\nThat was a time of astonishing innovation in mobile app design. Twitterrific, the [first native Twitter client](http:\/\/iconfactory.com\/software\/twitterrific_history) for iPhone, effectively [invented key aspects](http:\/\/furbo.org\/2011\/03\/11\/twitterrific-firsts\/) of modern Twitter interaction and terminology; [Tweetie](http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tweetie), perhaps the most popular Twitter client of its time, [pioneered touch interaction paradigms](http:\/\/www.jeremydstanley.com\/twitter-iphone-history.html) such as pull to refresh. And then there were [Weet](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/iphone\/weet-review\/), [Osfoora](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/osfoora-hd-review\/), [Birdfeed](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/06\/29\/birdfeed-finally-an-iphone-twitter-client-to-match-tweeties-speed-and-simplicity\/), [Twittelator](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twittelator-review\/), [Echofon](http:\/\/www.echofon.com\/twitter\/iphone\/), [Tweetings](http:\/\/www.tweetings.net\/site\/), [TweetList](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tweetlist), and dozens of other apps that helped refine and redefine the idea of what Twitter on an iPhone could be.\n\nGood Twitter clients weren’t easy to create, but the challenge they packed was intriguing and flexible. As a Twitter developer, you needed to design an app that would primarily display textual information (this was [before Twitter photos](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2011\/searchphotos) ), handle hyperlinks, manage interactions between users, account for different network conditions, possibly integrate with third-party sharing services years before iOS 8, and, most of all, be fast, responsive, and easy to use. The constraints of Twitter clients in 2009\/2010 freed many from the struggle of coming up with an original app idea.\n\nIf you’re using an iOS app [❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:1) today, there’s a good chance some of its features or design ideas first appeared in a Twitter client five years ago.\n\nWe know how the story moved forward. In April 2010, Twitter realized that they needed an official iOS presence on the App Store, so they bought Loren Brichter’s Tweetie, [relaunched it as Twitter for iPhone](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2010\/twitter-for-iphone), and Brichter released the ( [unsurprisingly genius](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twitter-for-ipad-review\/) ) Twitter for iPad.[❲2❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:2) For a while, it looked like Tweetie would live on, but then Twitter started adding [questionable features](http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2011\/03\/20\/why-the-quick-bar-dickbar-is-still-so-offensive) to it, and [it became clear](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/) that the third-party Twitter client would be *persona non grata* on the App Store.\n\nOver the years, there have been countless examples of Twitter prioritizing their own app and a closed ecosystem approach over third-party developers and improvements to the API. From the [infamous quadrant](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2012\/changes-coming-to-twitter-api) and [token limits](http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2012\/11\/16\/twitter-being-a-dick-again) to the [display guidelines](http:\/\/theaxx.net\/posts\/2013\/2\/20\/on-tweetbot-and-twitter-display-guidlines) and constant reticence about bringing new features to the API, Twitter has been nebulous in providing an official stance on third-party clients after the Tweetie acquisition, but the subtext of their announcements has always been fairly clear to everyone in the third-party scene. Twitter wanted people to use their official app, not a third-party client.\n\nBefore the Twitter acquisition in 2010, I was using a bunch of third-party clients but I had eventually elected Tweetie as my preferred one. After Brichter’s app turned into Twitter for iPhone, I stuck to it for a while, but then I was allured by Tapbots’ promise of a Twitter client for power users. As I wrote in [my original review](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), Tweetbot had everything I was looking for, and that was before Tapbots would bring [fantastic new features](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/) that made it even more versatile.\n\nI loved Tweetbot in a way that I didn’t love any other app for iOS. I have extremely vivid and personal memories of getting the first beta builds of Tweetbot for iPhone and iPad, and, until [Editorial came around](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/editorial-for-ipad-review\/), Tweetbot was the app I spent most of my days in. From 2011 until earlier this year, I used Tweetbot every working hour of every day. Tweetbot *was* Twitter for me.\n\nThat’s not to say that I stopped checking in on the state of other Twitter clients for iOS, but I certainly became less curious because I had found *the one*. I’ve primarily continued to [keep an eye on Twitterrific](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/twitterrific\/), but I largely ignored the third-party space for two years. Last year, the launch of iOS 7 motivated me to look for new Twitter clients again and I stumbled across new versions of [TweetLogix](http:\/\/www.onloft.com\/), Echofon, and [Tweet7](http:\/\/tweet7app.com\/), but my affection for Tweetbot and the fact that the majority of my Internet friends were using Tapbots’ app convinced me that I didn’t have to look for anything else.\n\nI like to think that I’m naturally curious, but, for my Twitter client of choice, I had become complacent and fixated on the belief that the official Twitter app could never offer anything valuable again. Earlier this year, an idea started poking me in the back of my mind: if the rest of the world is using the Twitter app for iOS, shouldn’t I give it another chance?\n\nThis realization came from a simple occasion: I was having dinner out with some friends, and I noticed that they were using the Twitter app for iPhone to read news and follow their favorite celebrities. Tweetbot was Twitter for me and I was certain that I could never switch to another app, but they seemed to be just fine with the official app and its lack of streaming, mute filters, quick actions, and all those other great details Tweetbot had. “They’re not power users”, I thought, and that settled it.\n\nStill. For someone who likes to think he’s curious and writes about apps for a living, my unwillingness to *at least try* the app from the service I use every day was remarkable in its shortsightedness. Twitter had changed since 2011, and it wasn’t meant for power users. The rest of the world was using Twitter through the official apps and I thought that I knew better than anyone else. So, a fun experiment began:\n\nI started using the official Twitter client as my main Twitter app on my iPhone and iPad.\n\nFor the past six months, I’ve been reevaluating my entire Twitter experience based on the apps I use to read tweets and interact with people. The idea made a lot more sense once I stepped out of my preconceptions: I wanted to understand what 2014 Twitter was like and if that meant sacrificing my nerd cred and use a [Muggle](http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muggle) ’s Twitter app, so be it. But at the same time, [I’ve gone back and forth](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-5-iphone-6-support-interactive-notifications-and-ios-8-extensions\/) between Twitter and third-party clients, primarily out of habit, but also because they still offer powerful features and design details that I appreciate.\n\nI didn’t want to focus on the history of Twitter clients, my thoughts on Twitter’s policies, or every single Twitter app currently available for iOS 8. I also couldn’t compare every single feature or design decision for every possible scenario a Twitter client could be used in.\n\nInstead, I attempted to address my curiosity from a utilitarian standpoint. Given the three most popular Twitter apps for iOS (Twitter, Tweetbot, and Twitterrific), I wanted to slowly evaluate their features for my use case. To do this, I assembled a list of features *I need* a Twitter client to be capable of handling and I started taking notes every time I switched between clients. I’ve been doing this since early June.\n\nI’ve spent weeks comparing features and changing apps to understand the kind of experience they want to promote. But implementation details and design differences aside, I also kept wondering the same question: was the real Twitter different from the third-party clients I used for three years?\n\nWhat’s 2014 Twitter like on iOS?\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n### Notes\n\n**Update : Clarified that Tweetbot’s web view has a Readability mode and its double tap gesture on tab bar icons for timelines can scroll to the last read tweet if possible. Clarified that Twitterrific can load favorites and mentions on other people’s profiles too.\n\nThe apps tested for this article were the latest versions of [Twitter](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitter\/id333903271?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), [Twitterrific](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitterrific-5-for-twitter\/id580311103?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), and [Tweetbot 3 for iPhone](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter.-elegant\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\nI only considered Tapbots’ iPhone app due to the lack of Tweetbot 3 for iPad. Both Twitter and Twitterrific (Universal apps) were tested in their iPhone and iPad versions, with design and feature differences noted when appropriate.\n\nYou can click (or tap) images to get a full-size version. You can link to any specific section using the Table of Contents above.\n\n**This is not a feature-by-feature comparison**. If you can’t find a feature you care about in this article, it’s not because I don’t think it’s important. Rather, it means that I don’t rely on that feature and I’m not knowledegeable about it enough to cover it (this policy applies to all [MacStories reviews](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/category\/reviews\/) ).\n\nPlease also note that I approached this with the idea that Twitter is not evil because it’s trying to make money with ads. If you’re sure you won’t be able to use any Twitter client with ads in the timeline, this article won’t convince you of the contrary (nor does it want to). The Twitter app has ads.\n\nAnd finally, I’d like to thank [Silvia](https:\/\/twitter.com\/aylys), [Myke](https:\/\/twitter.com\/imyke), [Stephen](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ismh), and [Graham](https:\/\/twitter.com\/greyham) for their notes and feedback on the article. Their patience is always immensely appreciated.\n\nThat said, let’s dive in.\n\n## Loading Timeline Gaps & Tweet Marker Sync\n\nI’m a Twitter completionist. Because I’ve always used the service to discover interesting new apps and links, I’ve developed a habit of trying not to miss a single tweet that is shared or retweeted in my timeline, with the only exception for the weekends.\n\nParticularly after launching [better linked posts](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/introducing-better-linked-posts\/) on the site and starting our [MacStories Weekly newsletter](http:\/\/macstories.us8.list-manage1.com\/subscribe?u=9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff&amp;id=a3452fa91f) with a dedicated Links section, discovering *stuff* on the Internet has become essential to my livelihood, and Twitter is the best (and most diverse) service for this. I know that I haven’t missed cool apps, links, and news thanks to my dedication to reading my entire timeline every day, and for this reason, in spite of strong evidence suggesting that Twitter doesn’t intend timelines to be consumed this way, I won’t change how I read Twitter.\n\nThis behavior makes timeline gaps and timeline sync one of the most prominent aspects I have to consider in a Twitter client. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and start reading my timeline from where I left it the night before; and, I want to know that I can close Twitter for a couple of hours in the afternoon without losing my place in a stream of tweets. More importantly, whenever a timeline gap occurs [❲3❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:3) I need the ability to load tweets without making the timeline scroll and lose my position.\n\nUnfortunately, the official Twitter app doesn’t support sync and leaves much to be desired for timeline gaps.\n\nThe app is capable of detecting timeline gaps [❲4❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:4), but it can keep your position (load tweets above or below) in the timeline only if you tap “Load more Tweets” when the gap is close to the top or bottom of the stream. It’s not clear that Twitter for iOS supports this (there’s no visual indication like in Tweetbot), and, sometimes, the app still scrolls the timeline upon loading tweets from a gap.\n\nThis means that you may end up scrolling back and forth in your timeline if you want to keep reading Twitter exactly where you left off, which can be a considerable waste of time when you’re a completionist and follow >1000 accounts. The lack of sync makes everything worse as timeline position isn’t shared across devices.\n\nIn practice, the Twitter app results in several minutes I spend scrolling and trying to find the last tweet I saw when I closed the app. Every morning and whenever I leave the app for a couple of hours, Twitter either completely reloads the timeline (pushing me to top to see the latest tweets) or inserts a timeline gap that occasionally fails to load new tweets above my position.\n\nCombine this with the app’s tendency to not restore its state when it’s launched, and it’s easy to understand that Twitter doesn’t care about treating its timeline as a stream of tweets you want to read in its entirety from oldest to newest. In spite of timeline gaps, Twitter seems to be all about the latest tweets and providing you with fresh content, which can be tedious for a completionist – a problem that is common to modern social apps such as Facebook and Instagram as well.\n\nTwitterrific fares better in this comparison, but I find the best implementation to be Tweetbot’s. Both apps support timeline gap detection and both allow you to sync your timeline position with iCloud and [Tweet Marker](http:\/\/tweetmarker.net\/), but Tweetbot has been faster and more reliable in my tests.\n\nThe concept of timeline sync between Twitter clients across multiple devices was popularized by Tweet Marker, a service launched by [Manton Reece](http:\/\/www.manton.org\/) in [2011](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/mac\/twitterrific-4-3-syncs-timeline-position-with-tweet-marker\/) (first teased as [Tweetmarks](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/developers-tweetmarks-will-keep-your-twitter-client-in-sync\/) ) and that is embedded in dozens of clients for iOS and OS X. Tied to your Twitter account, Tweet Marker offers a mostly invisible, volatile bookmark that saves your position in the timeline every time you use an app that integrates with the service. This allows you to, say, stop reading tweets from 2 hours ago in Tweetbot on the iPhone and pick up in the same spot in Twitterrific for iPad without having to scroll to find the last tweet you saw. The implementation varies across apps and it’s dependent on how developers handle timeline gap detection and scrolling.\n\nIn Twitterrific, you can choose to show the visual Tweet Marker indicator and automatically scroll to it. When the same set of tweets is loaded across two different clients, Twitterrific is usually able to quickly take you to the last tweet you were at when you closed another Tweet Marker-enabled app. If you keep two apps open at the same time, Tweet Marker sync tends to be flawless in Twitterrific.\n\nIn my experience, Twitterrific loses position in the timeline when it has to deal with tweets that haven’t been loaded yet and that require loading a timeline gap. Twitterrific with Tweet Marker sync works well with recent tweets (e.g. You left home thirty minutes ago and want to keep reading tweets now that you’re at the grocery store), but it doesn’t work well when there are hours of tweets between the most recent tweet in your timeline and your last position hundreds of tweets ago.\n\nTweetbot has the most solid implementation of timeline gap loading and Tweet Marker sync. Tapbots’ app rarely fails to load your last position when you launch it and it’ll always try to load as many tweets as possible (as allowed by the API) between your position and recent tweets above a timeline gap. Tweetbot shows a visual Tweet Marker indicator, always scrolls to the last tweet saved by Tweet Marker, and can keep position for the Mentions tab, too.\n\nWhat’s great about Tweetbot is that beyond stable Tweet Marker sync and handling of timeline gaps, it also clearly indicates how to load more tweets above or below a gap in the timeline. When I wake up in the morning and I want to catch up on all the tweets I missed overnight, I can let the timeline gap turn into tweets above my current position so the full stream is loaded and I can keep reading without scrolling back to older tweets. Tweetbot appears to be designed with an eye for timeline completionists, and it has been this way since [its early adoption of Tweet Marker](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync\/).\n\nBoth Twitterrific and Tweetbot come with a second option for timeline sync – iCloud. I, however, have always preferred Tweet Marker for two reasons: I never had issues with Tweet Marker (unlike my iCloud account), and it works across multiple apps from different developers. So while iCloud adds the benefit of marking direct messages as read in Tweetbot, it doesn’t sync my position between Tweetbot and Twitterrific, which Tweet Marker handles elegantly.\n\n## Web Views\n\nI spend a considerable amount of time discovering links on Twitter and opening webpages to see what they’re about. For this reason, being able to effortlessly switch between web views and the timeline as well as the ability to quickly share links to other apps are valuable aspects in my Twitter workflow.\n\nThe Twitter app is, again, a disappointment from this standpoint. Links in Twitter open in a modal web view that takes over the entire app, with the title of the webpage displayed in the title bar. You can tweet a link (the only instance where the web view will be superseded by a UI element of the app), copy it, mail it, send it to a read later service, or open it in Safari; you can’t share it natively with extensions because, for reasons unknown, Twitter doesn’t support the native iOS 8 share sheet.\n\nI cringe every time I have to open a web view in the Twitter app because it means that a webpage needs my full attention while it’s loading – I can’t switch to another part of my timeline, and I can’t dismiss the web view but keep it open in the background. The lack of share sheets only exacerbates my distaste for Twitter’s web view: I can’t easily save links to extensions when I’m using Twitter, which slows me down.\n\nThe only nice touch of Twitter’s web view is that it displays the full URL of a webpage in the title bar under the webpage’s title.[❲5❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:5) Twitter also displays a lock icon for HTTPS connections, which is a welcome plus.\n\nWeb views are much better in Twitterrific: they’re still modal, but Twitterrific supports a readability mode for webpages (either Instapaper or Readability) and lets you [share URLs using the iOS 8 share sheet](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/twitterrific-5-8-with-share-sheets\/). Twitterrific doesn’t display webpage URLs and titles simultaneously (it only shows the URL while a webpage is loading) and it doesn’t come with any special icon for HTTPS, but it adds a dedicated 1Password shortcut to quickly fill logins with the [1Password extension](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/1password-5-for-ios-8-review\/) (which I never used personally for links in tweets).\n\nSupport for share sheets in web views makes processing links great in Twitterrific for iPad: once you get used to the power and convenience of extensions, it’s hard to use the custom sharing menu of the Twitter app, unreasonably limited to options Twitter decided for its users and that don’t make Twitter a good iOS 8 citizen.\n\nUnfortunately, Twitterrific suffers from the same issue of other apps that implement extensions: [the system can be flaky](http:\/\/bryan.io\/post\/97658826431\/what-we-learned-building-the-tumblr-ios-share). Twitterrific displays action extensions for webpages that are also supported by Safari, but only Safari returns the full DOM of a webpage, which makes extensions such as [ImageDrain](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/imagedrain-for-safari-extensions\/id932866396?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) and [Stacks](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/stacks-2-new-age-currency\/id719162125?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) useless in Twitterrific. This isn’t Twitterrific’s fault – just like I can’t blame the app for [messing up the order of extensions](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/ios-8-1-1-brings-fixes-for-share-sheet-extension-reordering-icloud-crashes\/) if the share sheet is modified with drag & drop.\n\nThe way Tweetbot handles opening links from any view of the app is my favorite. As I mentioned in [my original review of Tweetbot 3 last year](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/), Tapbots built a web view system that lets you open a link without the in-app browser taking over the entire app. Each web view is modal to the view it was activated from: if you open a link from the timeline view, the timeline will turn into a web view, but you’ll still be able to switch to other sections such as Mentions or Favorites.\n\nThis design choice frees you from the pressure of having to open a link knowing that you won’t be able to use the app in any other way while a webpage is shown, and it also lets you open multiple web views relative to their originating sections – you can open a link from the Timeline and another one separately in Search, for example. This is great if you want to multitask with web views in Tweetbot, and it makes me wish that more apps – not just Twitter clients – would be inspired by it.\n\nTweetbot also supports extensions with the same limitations of share sheets from Twitterrific. The system mostly works – I smile every time I can easily [save a link to Todoist](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/) or [a tweet to Notebox](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/merging-text-captured-from-ios-8-extensions\/) without leaving the app I’m using – but extensions can occasionally fail.\n\nIn switching between these three clients for the past months, I’ve noticed that I miss Tweetbot’s non-modal web views but I prefer the iPad to go through favorites I want to turn into todos or notes, and thus Twitterrific. The Twitter app has a lot to learn from The Iconfactory and Tapbots when it comes to web views, but it makes up for those deficiencies at the very starting point: previews for links.\n\n## Cards and Previewing Tweets\n\nTwitter offers a feature called [Twitter Cards](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/cards\/overview) that enable you, as a user, to preview content without leaving the Twitter timeline for a web view. There are different types of cards: from the popular Summary and Gallery to the more peculiar Lead Generation and Audio Player cards, the official Twitter apps support a wide range of interactive media previews that aren’t made available to third-party clients via API.\n\nI suspect that most Twitterrific and Tweetbot users who never used the Twitter app for extended periods of time largely ignore the existence of Twitter Cards – I assume so because I did that. Since I started using Twitter on iOS, I became fascinated with the concept and realization of cards – so much that [MacStories’ tweets](https:\/\/twitter.com\/macstoriesnet) support the Summary card and readers can sign up to our Weekly newsletter [directly from Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/502459963894403072).\n\nI first [wrote about cards on MacStories](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/the-utility-of-twitter-cards\/) when Twitter launched audio cards for SoundCloud and iTunes:\n\n> Besides the obvious [photos](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/cards\/types\/photo), galleries, and aforementioned audio cards, there are [several types of cards](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/cards\/types) that get expanded or are interactive in the Twitter apps for iOS. In the months I’ve spent using Twitter for iPhone and iPad, I’ve come to expect articles to reveal [Summary Cards](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/cards\/types\/summary) (we support them with MacStories links) because they often tell me whether a link is worth opening or not just by looking at their preview. I find summary cards for web articles to offer more information and to be more respectful of my time (and cellular data).  \n\nIn short, Twitter Cards turn tweets into rich previews that are easy to understand without visiting a webpage. Often, these previews embed relevant media directly in the timeline, so you can view images\/press buttons without even opening a tweet’s detail view.\n\nI’ve become a fan of Twitter Cards because they help me save time and find more cool links. Sometimes, the text that accompanies a link doesn’t really sell the article: by tapping the tweet, I can see if there’s a Summary card and take a look at the first image of an article, perhaps a brief description too, and decide whether the link may actually be worth opening or not. I was able to reevaluate dozens of links that I then used for MacStories or MacStories Weekly thanks to the Summary card. Same deal with YouTube videos: YouTube supports the Player card, which gives you a tappable video thumbnail *and* a description of the video in the tweet detail view.\n\nMost cards are [deep-linked to their official apps](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/cards\/mobile), meaning that content can also be viewed directly in a native app if it’s installed on your device. YouTube videos can be played back in the YouTube app, Spotify links can be opened in Spotify, Kickstarter projects can be displayed in the official Kickstarter app, and so forth. This is optional – you have to tap a dedicated “app button” in the tweet detail view to beam content to its associated app, and it’s a great experience if you prefer native apps to web views. If you don’t have the app installed, Twitter will let you download it from the App Store using [SKStoreProductViewController](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/StoreKit\/Reference\/SKITunesProductViewController_Ref\/index.html), which opens an App Store panel that doesn’t take you away from the app.[❲6❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:6)\n\nEven more impressive is when cards are more than thumbnail previews and bring interactive content to the Twitter timeline. Thumbnails for Kickstarter links can be tapped and a player for a project video will open immediately; iTunes Movie Trailers thumbnails also turn into a video player inside the Twitter app ( [Star Wars proof](https:\/\/twitter.com\/itunestrailers\/status\/538426856656367618) ); SoundCloud links feature a special Audio Player card that turns into a persistent mini-player.\n\nCards are a smart move: they don’t compromise the 140-character nature of tweets, but instead they use web content to offer previews with deep ties to native apps that, in my opinion, make a lot of sense for an information network on a mobile device. I *want* to be able to open YouTube videos in the YouTube app and *of course* Kickstarter links should offer an option to easily switch to the Kickstarter app that already has all my credentials and preferences.\n\nIn daily usage, [Summary Cards](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/cards\/types\/summary) are the ones I see and use the most, and I’ve grown used to being able to preview articles before I tap them: it’s a great way to avoid clickbait and other sensationalistic garbage. Unlike other cards, web summaries aren’t embedded directly in the timeline – you’ll need to tap tweets to see them.\n\nCards work in the opposite direction of traditional clients: instead of forcing you to tap a link, they bring a native snippet of the web to you.\n\nBut there’s a problem: supporting Twitter Cards is entirely up to the publisher\/content owner, and for this reason not every link automatically gets a rich visual preview on Twitter. While popular blogs and media services tend to support Twitter Cards nowadays, there’s still a vast sea of independent publishers who have no idea what the benefit of a card could be, or, really, what a Twitter Card is. When links aren’t supported by a card in the timeline, Twitter falls back to looking like Tweetie and any other client: a tweet, and a blue hyperlink.[❲7❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:7)\n\nI also want to briefly mention the unusual and powerful [Lead Generation Card](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2013\/capture-user-interest-with-the-lead-generation-card) that we’re using to handle signups to our MacStories Weekly newsletter through Twitter. Thanks to [integration](http:\/\/blog.mailchimp.com\/introducing-twitters-lead-generation-cards\/) with MailKimp, Twitter lets you build cards for your newsletter that display a description and signup button alongside a tweet in the official Twitter app. To sign up, Twitter uses your configured email address: tap a button, and you’re signed up. No need to open a web view (although you can), no need to type your email address. This card type also extends to buy products from cards (which I haven’t tried) and other services that turn Twitter users into customers.\n\nAs a user, I’m a fan of the idea, although it still feels strange to be able to act on tweets and not just “consume” them. As a website owner, I can say that Twitter signups doubled our newsletter subscribers overnight since we tested them, which has been a positive experience.\n\nCards aside, Twitter has long supported timeline previews for photos, a feature that was expanded in the past year to include [multiple photos](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2014\/photos-just-got-more-social) and [animated GIFs](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/twitter-adds-support-for-animated-gifs-on-web-android-and-iphone\/). I was initially put off by the former, but I’ve learned to appreciate the ability to include multiple attachments in uploads, and I’ve started to think of pictures as separate entities from the limited character space of tweets.\n\nNative GIFs are welcome: GIFs I have in my iOS library can be uploaded through the Twitter app, but the service [encodes them to video](http:\/\/blog.embed.ly\/post\/89265229166\/what-twitter-isnt-telling-you-about-gifs) instead of preserving the original GIF format, which I’m not a fan of because I can’t redownload them. Still, they look like GIFs in the Twitter timeline, which should be okay for most people.\n\nThe Twitter app disappoints with direct URLs to images or videos stored elsewhere. For a long time, Tweetbot and Twitterrific have been able to turn image and video URLs into inline previews – a nice touch if you want to link to [a GIF stored on your own server](http:\/\/www.macdrifter.com\/2014\/10\/making-my-ideal-sharing-tool-with-transmit-for-ios.html) \/S3 bucket or simply link to an image from someone else’s website. This is the epitome of a third-party client feature: it’s the right thing to do, but Twitter likely wants to encourage uploads to its own photo service, so they won’t support direct links to images or videos with native previews.\n\nA great touch of the official Twitter app is that playing videos (whether they’re previews in the timeline or videos embedded in a web view) doesn’t pause audio playback that may be happening in another app. Instead, Twitter will simply lower the volume of existing audio playback in the background and play a video you’ve tapped alongside it.\n\nI come across this difference on a daily basis: I always have music or podcasts playing on my iPad when I’m working, and I don’t want them to pause because I chose to view a Vine or YouTube video in Twitter. This will be strange the first time you’ll see it in action, but, at least for me, it absolutely started making sense after a couple of days and I now wish that iOS had an option to play multiple media items at the same time.\n\nTwitter Cards aren’t available to third-party clients over the API, which has forced Tweetbot and Twitterrific to come up with their own custom integrations to display tweet previews for web content. The result is that the timeline shown in these two clients will look different and out of place after you get used to the richness of previews in the Twitter app.\n\nFor Tweetbot, Tapbots didn’t build any sort of visual preview for article links, which are shared and diplayed as regular hyperlinks in the app. Tweetbot has proper support for Twitter photos (both for tweets containing single and multiple photos) and it can load and show an inline preview for any URL that points directly to an image stored elsewhere. This is useful if you want to tweet GIFs using links fetched from services like [Giphy](http:\/\/giphy.com\/) – they will be visualized inline by Tweetbot, which comes in handy when you don’t want to share a native GIF through the official Twitter app (Tweetbot can’t upload GIFs to Twitter with the API).\n\nNotwithstanding its API limitations, Tweetbot provides decent support for image and video previews. The app shows thumbnails for YouTube, Vine, and Instagram videos, which are differentiated from image thumbnails by a Play button; while YouTube thumbnails will take you to a YouTube web view, Vine and Instagram videos will play in a popup over the timeline. The same video player is also used for native Twitter GIFs, which are always transcoded to video by the service.\n\nTweetbot shows inline previews for Instagram [❲8❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:8), Droplr, CloudApp, Flickr, img.ly, Mobypicture, and yfrog images. Tweetbot can’t support previews for images shared in Direct Messages, and it can’t preview native Twitter videos (such as [this one](https:\/\/twitter.com\/support\/status\/539826848641724416) ) either. The former is a particularly annoying limitation, as tapping an image URL shared in a DM will open a Twitter web view that will require authentication.\n\nOne of my favorite touches of Tweetbot is its ability to preview iTunes content inline, which I appreciate when it comes to iTunes links for apps.\n\nTwitterrific, like Tweetbot, can’t support Twitter Cards and doesn’t have any inline previews for web links. Twitterrific shows previews for native Twitter photos, but only individual ones; Twitterrific, in fact, still hasn’t been updated to support multiple Twitter photos, so tweets containing more than one photo will only show the first one in Twitterrific. This is a major issue if you want to make sure you always see all photos attached to a tweet. Twitterrific can’t show native Twitter GIFs either.\n\nTwitterrific displays inline previews for Droplr, CloudApp, Instagram, and Flickr links, but tapping their thumbnails (which can be set to small or large) will open a webpage to view the full image – it won’t load the image in a floating popup (as is the case with Twitter photos). Twitterrific can, however, load direct image URLs without opening a web view, which also shows a progress bar on top of the timeline.\n\nThanks to its integrated previews and iTunes support, I prefer Tweetbot to Twitterrific for previews of images and videos uploaded to third-party services.\n\nThe evolution of Twitter from quick status sharing service to an information network that spans text, links, and media has left third-party clients in the cold for Cards and the photo features the service has been rolling out in the past year. Tweetbot and Twitterrific – primarily due to API limitations but also because of their own implementations – largely treat Twitter timelines as streams of text with the occasional photo or GIF.\n\nIn the months I’ve spent using the Twitter app, I’ve come to expect my Twitter client to support multiple photos, native GIFs, summaries for web articles, and other static or interactive previews with Cards. I *want* to be able to listen to SoundCloud snippets in the timeline with a mini player, and I appreciate that Twitter gives me the tools to let people subscribe to my newsletter easily and securely.\n\nTwitter is inconsistent in its implementation of Cards and previews across platforms. The iPhone app is the company’s most supported and frequently updated mobile client, always receiving the latest design updates and feature additions. On the iPad, only *some* card types are supported, while others are inexplicably broken.\n\nIn practical usage, I’m faster at discerning interesting links in the Twitter app because of its support for Summary Cards. The convenience of being able to see a quick preview of an article allows me to decide whether a link deserves my attention before tapping it. Selecting a tweet to see a summary is still faster than switching back and forth between the timeline and a web view. My main issue is that Twitter Cards aren’t supported by a few websites I read frequently; I wish more publishers added Cards integration to their content for Twitter users.\n\n## Extensions\n\nTwitter doesn’t support native iOS 8 share sheets; Twitterrific and Tweetbot do. I don’t understand Twitter’s decision.\n\nAs I [wrote](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/merging-text-captured-from-ios-8-extensions\/) last month:\n\n> I don’t understand why, two months after the release of iOS 8, the official Twitter app for iOS doesn’t implement the system share sheet for action and share extensions. There is no technical hurdle preventing Twitter from adding their own custom buttons to a share sheet or coming up with ways to [show both custom and native share sheets](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/different-share-sheets\/). *If* the decision is political because Twitter doesn’t want to allow users to easily share Twitter content to external services, then it’s a stupid one, likely driven by an absurd idea that “user lock-in” is good for “engagement” and other buzzwords possibly made up by the same person in charge of the [strategy statatement](http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2014\/11\/12\/twitter-mission-statement) (but isn’t a share sheet all about connecting people to their world and other brands after all? Isn’t a share sheet “information sharing”? This is why I’m not a CFO, I guess). *If* a share sheet is considered dangerous by Twitter, then I guess that Twitter has bigger problems to worry about. Thankfully, third-party Twitter clients are still around to be good iOS citizens.  \n\nThe way I see it, it makes no sense for Twitter to withhold support for the native iOS share sheet when they already have a few custom options that could be supplanted by better, official, and native extensions to let users share tweets and links to more services. If the decision is political, it’s a stupid one; if the reason is that this isn’t high on Twitter’s priority list, then their iOS team should know better.\n\nTweetbot and Twitterrific let you share tweets and links from the timeline and web views via extensions, which is useful. The entire extension framework in iOS 8 is still buggy and prone to presenting errors and it occasionally crashes, but there’s nothing Tapbots and The Iconfactory can do about it. Developers need better tools to debug extensions, filter them by type, and disable them when necessary, so hopefully Apple will keep improving the system over time.\n\nCuriously enough, neither Twitterrific nor Tweetbot offer a share extension to send tweets using their app interfaces from anywhere on iOS. It’s a strange omission considering that both apps were quick to embrace share sheets for getting links out of their respective apps.\n\nI’ve been using Twitterrific to save links through extensions because it’s available on the iPad and it lets me go through my Favorite tweets (I give a lot of faves every day) and send them to other apps easily. I loved the ability to merge links to multiple tweets with Notebox, and that wouldn’t have been possible without Twitterrific for iPad, updated for iOS 8. If you only care about Twitter clients on your iPhone, support for extensions in Tweetbot and Twitterrific is mostly the same – Twitterrific may get a slight edge over Tweetbot because it lets you save individual DMs through extensions.\n\nTwitter should really add support for share sheets to its iOS app. The reliance on old and custom sharing options is inexcusable and it slows down the user experience.\n\n### Gestures\n\n**Note**: The following section is technical and boring if you’re not into gestures. I decided to include it for the sake of research and to mention a few smaller implementation details. If you’re not interested, you can skip to the next section by clicking [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#profiles).\n\nEver since I began using Tweetie in my iPhone in 2009, I’ve grown used to interacting with my timeline using gestures. Long presses, swipes, double taps, quick flicks – iOS has provided a great opportunity for developers to explore how multitouch can simplify the act of browsing your timeline and hide functionality until you need it.\n\nIn using Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and Twitter for iOS over the past months, I’ve collected how these three apps implement gestures differently and the trade-offs involved with enabling new iOS features and interaction patterns.\n\n#### Tap & Hold\n\n**Twitter**\n\nOn the iPad, you can tap & hold on a tweet you sent to:\n\n* Mail tweet\n* Copy link to tweet\n* Send to read later service (if contains link)\n* Delete\n\nThe iPhone app has the same options, but it adds a shortcut to [share a tweet via DM](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/twitter-adds-ability-to-share-tweets-via-direct-message\/).\n\nYou can also tap & hold tweets sent by others on the iPad to:\n\n* Mute\n* Block or report\n* Mail tweet\n* Copy link to tweet\n* Send to read later service (if contains link)\n\nThe iPhone adds, again, Share via Direct Message but presents the other options in a different order. It’s not clear why Twitter isn’t applying some consistency to this menu, as it makes things slower when switching across devices.\n\nYou can also tap & hold links directly in the timeline of Twitter for iOS, and, in this case, the options are the same between the iPhone and iPad app:\n\n* Tweet (it’ll place the cursor before the link, adding a space between them)\n* Mail\n* Copy\n* Send to read later service\n* Open in Safari\n\nTap & hold is supported for user avatars as well, showing integration with Apple’s Contacts app:\n\n* Mute\n* Block or Report\n* Create new contact\n* Add to contact\n\nIn the same vein, you can tap & hold usernames in tweets, but only from a tweet’s detail view because usernames aren’t directly tappable in timeline. When you do, you’ll get these options:\n\n* Copy\n* Create new contact\n* Add to existing contact\n\nAnd, of course, you can tap & hold photos to:\n\nIn addition to timeline tap & hold shortcuts, you can long-press the Me tab to show the account switcher, both on the iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe last tap & hold shortcut is one of my favorite ones: you can tap & hold the compose button (top right) to bring up a Drafts screen so you can modify a saved draft and send it as a tweet.\n\n**Twitterrific**\n\nTwitterrific and Tweetbot are more consistent with the rest of the system in that they have now replaced their former custom menus with share sheets for the most part.\n\nIn Twitterrific, long-tapping a tweet shows the share sheet with extensions, passing the Twitter URL of a tweet to it. The share sheet contains custom buttons to copy a link to the tweet, open it in Safari, tweet its link again, and translate it.\n\nThis idea of using the share sheet for every tap & hold gesture is carried out through the entire app with slightly different results:\n\n* Usernames: the @username is passed to an extension; share sheet contains buttons to copy the profile’s URL and tweet the @username. Usernames are tappable in the timeline.\n* Links: the URL is passed to the share sheet, which contains custom buttons to open it in Safari and tweet it.\n* Hashtags: the share sheet receives the hashtag’s name and has buttons to copy a Twitter link for a hashtag’s search, view the search in Safari, and tweet the hashtag.\n* Images from the timeline: the share sheet captures the Twitter photo’s URL.\n* Images from the expanded view (tap image first): share sheet, but the image file is passed to extensions, so you’ll see a different set of them (such as [Dropshare](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/dropshare-for-ios-uploads-images-to-amazon-s3-and-rackspace-cloud-files\/) ).\n\nFurthermore, Twitterrific lets you tap & hold tabs to customize them, and you can also long-tap your profile picture in the top left to bring up the account switcher. In the timeline, you can tap & hold the retweet button (tap tweet first) to open the compose screen in old-style RT mode.\n\n**Tweetbot**\n\nTapbots’ take on tap & hold gestures is similar to The Iconfactory’s, but Tweetbot still has a few custom panels that don’t use the iOS 8 share sheet.\n\nThe share sheet is used in the following places in the app:\n\n* Tweets: the Twitter URL is passed to extensions; there are custom buttons to copy a link to the tweet, copy the tweet’s text, and open it in Safari.\n* Links: the URL is passed to extensions; there are buttons to open the link in Safari, copy it, and tweet it. Like the Twitter app, tweeting a link this way places the cursor before the link in the compose field, adding a space.\n* Images from timeline: the share sheet receives the Twitter photo URL; there are buttons to open in Safari, copy, and tweet a link.\n\nOn the other hand, Tweetbot’s tap & hold gestures use custom panels for:\n\n* Usernames and avatars: the panel shows follow status and buttons to DM, manage in lists, mute, unfollow, and report for spam. Usernames in Tweetbot are clickable in the timeline.\n* Images in expanded view: the menu has options to save or copy the image, plus view it on the web and tweet its link. There are no photo-oriented share and action extensions in Tweetbot.\n* Hashtags: options to tweet the hashtag, copy it, and mute it.\n\nIn addition to share sheets and panels, you can tap & hold the gear icon in a tweet’s detail view to post a link to the tweet and long-tap your avatar or username to view your profile on Favstar. Tweetbot lets you tap & hold tabs to customize them and, like the Twitter app, long-pressing the compose button opens your existing drafts.\n\nAs [I noted when version 3.5 was released](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-5-iphone-6-support-interactive-notifications-and-ios-8-extensions\/), adopting the system share sheet forced Tapbots to drop the ability to view full URLs by holding them.\n\n#### Double taps\n\nDouble taps don’t seem to be popular in Twitter clients. The only use I’ve found was in Tweetbot, which lets you double tap in four different places:\n\n* DM tab bar icon: mark all messages as read;\n* Tab bar, any timeline: scroll back to the top (Twitter uses a single tap for this; Twitterrific simply relies on tapping the status bar);\n* Search tab bar icon: get into the search field and start typing;\n* Profile tab bar icon: open your Favstar profile.\n\n#### Swipes\n\nLike double taps, swipe gestures aren’t used too much in the Twitter clients I tried. Tweetie was famous for [its swipe gesture](http:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=bL8LXoyGfhk) that revealed an action bar for a tweet, but that’s gone in Twitter for iPhone, which uses swipes to navigate across Timeline, Discover, and Activity.\n\nIn the Twitter app, you can swipe through photos in profile pages on the iPad and swipe through photos on tweets that contain multiple ones. You can also swipe from the edge of the screen to navigate (iPhone) and swipe to delete DMs.\n\nIn Twitterrific, you can swipe right on a tweet to reply, and swipe left to view the conversation; this also works in DMs.\n\nTweetbot has deeper support for swipe gestures:\n\n* Swipe left on a tweet to open its detail view;\n* Short swipe right on a tweet to fave it, long swipe to reply. The short swipe can be configured to be fave or RT;\n* Swipe from the edge of the screen to navigate;\n* Swipe to delete a DM;\n* Swipe through multiple photos in a tweet;\n* Swipe up\/down with two fingers to change theme.\n\nIt’s hard to pick a favorite for gestures: there’s hundreds of details and variables to consider, and iOS 8 has brought consolidation in options shown via tap & hold. Twitterrific and Tweetbot have more convenient gestures than Twitter: Twitterrific is nice for quick replies; Tweetbot has a great flick gesture to dismiss images.\n\nI compiled this list of gestures out of curiosity and to show the little design decisions that can go into what most people would deem trivial or obvious. My takeaway is that I deeply miss Tweetie 2’s original swipe gesture for actions.\n\n## Profiles\n\nI look at user profiles on Twitter for various reasons. For my personal profile, I usually want to see who new followers are or I may need to find an old tweet or photo I sent. For other people’s profiles, I want to be able to look at their mentions, browse photos they’ve published, read their bio, and perhaps peek at their faves (it sounds creepy, but it’s a good way to discover interesting links – kind of like public bookmarks).\n\nTwitter, Tweetbot, and Twitterrific have radically different designs for user profiles.\n\nTweetbot shows bios and other essential information (tweets, followers, following, listed) at the top of the profile, leaving room at the bottom for a Recent Photos grid that displays thumbnails for your latest 12–16 photos and videos [❲9❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:9). You can tap a thumbnail to enlarge it and view the tweet it came with; tapping the tweet opens it in a detail view. Below the grid, Tweetbot shows when a user joined Twitter (useful to quickly spot spam accounts) and when the account’s last tweet was sent.\n\nWhen you want to look at people who follow you, Tweetbot is the only client that displays follower\/following counts in the Followers view. Again, this is a good way to quickly see if any weird spam account has started following you, blocking it preemptively; it’s also nice to be able to see when someone with a lot of followers has started following you (if you’re into that sort of thing) without having to open their profile page.\n\nSomething that is also unique to Tweetbot is its ability to load mentions and faves in other people’s profiles. As I mentioned above, I occasionally like to be able to see the tweets a person is receiving, and Tweetbot is the only client that makes it easy to see all mentions directed to a user. From a segmented control available at the top of a user’s Tweets page, you can load the user’s favorite tweets as well.\n\nI also want to point out how Tweetbot offers two ways to look at a user’s recently shared photos. Besides the Recent Photos grid in the Profile page, Tweetbot features a control in the top right corner of the timeline to [change between regular tweet layouts and media previews](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/), which filters out tweets that contain media recognized by the app with inline previews. This special mode lets you browse all media items shared by a user on Twitter, but you’ll still have to scroll and wait for Tweetbot to fetch older tweets.\n\nOf the three clients I tested for this article, Twitterrific comes with the most basic support for viewing user profiles and associated information. Accessing your profile in Twitterrific is done by tapping your avatar to reveal a sidebar and tapping a “i” button in the top toolbar or by simply tapping your avatar in a tweet.\n\nOnce in your profile, Twitterrific shows bio and counts, lets you view your tweets, faves, and mentions in separate views, but has no support to view recently shared media. The Followers view is equally barebones, providing a grid of user avatars\/names\/usernames with no bios or counts to better understand who’s following you. If you care about re-viewing photos you’ve previously shared, Twitterrific can’t help you.\n\nViewing other people’s profiles in Twitterrific adds a series of shortcuts at the bottom to follow, DM, or @mention the user, as well as a button to muffle, add to lists, block, report, and open the profile page in a twitter.com web view. Considering the basic realization in terms of design and functionality, it appears that viewing complete user profiles isn’t a priority for The Iconfactory in Twitterrific.\n\nThe Twitter app is diametrically opposed to Tweetbot and Twitterrific for viewing profiles: it prioritizes media and “quick engagement” over easy access to tweets, but it’s got substantial differences between the iPhone and iPad versions. If you’re used to third-party clients and have been using them for years, this is where the discrepancies between clients and the official app are most striking.\n\nOn the iPad, Twitter displays a large cover photo at the top as a background for a user’s profile picture, bio, and follow status (if it’s not your profile). Immediately below the top box, you’ll find tweets, followers, and following counts that are also buttons you can tap; next to them, there’s a big Folllow\/Unfollow indicator\/button and a gear icon that opens a popover with the following options:\n\n* Mute\n* Block or Report\n* Turn on notifications\n* Turn off retweets\n* Create new contact\n* Add to existing contact\n* Follow\/Unfollow\n* Add\/remove from lists\n* Send direct message\n\nThis menu feels a little crowded, and I often struggle to remember which option is which because the entire list is made of blue buttons with no visual differentiators like icons or color labels.\n\nWhen looking at followers, Twitter highlights the ability to easily follow back with one tap. In the Followers list on the iPad, the app displays a follower count in the title bar, the usual combination of avatar\/name\/username, and also bios. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t display how many followers a person has in this screen. Notably, each user has a one-tap Follow button, but unfollowing will require two taps as Twitter wants you to confirm your action.\n\nThe lower section of profiles on the iPad is more interesting. There’s a preview of a user’s most recent tweets (usually three of them) and you can tap a button to load all tweets in a separate view. Underneath tweets, there’s a scrollable gallery of recent photos (not GIFs or videos) that you can scroll and tap to enlarge items and view their associated tweet. I like this carousel because it gives me a quick way to view recent photos and I appreciate that tweets with multiple photos are supported as well.\n\nBut there’s more. You can tap a button to view more photos, and the app will open a grid view that contains every Twitter photo ever sent by a user.\n\nThe view is fast, easy to scan, and only the official Twitter app for iPad can provide this kind of visualization. It’s great that I can scroll quickly to two years ago and find photos I tweeted and get back to the original tweets. I use Twitter considerably more than Facebook for image sharing (whether they’re screenshots or photos), and I love that the app makes it simple to browse and scroll through old photos with no complications.\n\nAt the bottom of the profile view, Twitter for iPad adds different shortcuts depending on whether you’re looking at your own profile or someone else’s. In your profile, Twitter uses the end of the page to insert links to lists, favorites, drafts, and, again, people you’re following and people who follow you.\n\nThis is one of the worst parts of Twitter for iPad: not only does it make little sense to repeat the Followers and Following buttons – the sidebar on the left is left wholly unutilized when the Favorites, Lists, and Drafts buttons could have gone in there for easy access. Instead, if you want to read a list (as I do for my Apple News and Games lists), you have to open your profile, scroll, and find those unrecognizable buttons at the bottom.\n\nWhen you’re looking at other people’s profiles on the iPad, a “Who to follow” section is added below the aforementioned list with account recommendations based on the currently open profile.\n\nI have to say, for all the fun tech writers often make of Twitter recommendations, these are actually pretty solid and accurate. As with other screens, accounts are listed with bios and one-tap Follow buttons, and I have found quite a few new accounts of interesting people to follow through these screens – so I guess they do work as advertised.\n\nWhat may be a problem for some people is that, among the “Who to follow” suggestions, there’s a chance you’ll see a promoted account. Again, there are ads in the Twitter app, and this is another area where ads can be injected. Personally, I don’t mind: years of reading on the web have taught me how to separate content from ads and, as the owner of an ad-supported website, I think it would be ironic to complain about the fact that the company that drives a good percentage of our traffic is relying on ads for revenue.\n\nProfiles in the Twitter app for iPhone are great. [Redesigned in September](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-for-iphone-gets-redesigned-profiles-interactive-notifications-on-ios-8\/), profiles on the iPhone have the same options of the iPad app but they simplify access to essential (and most interesting) sections: Tweets, Photos, and Favorites.\n\nThese three sections are organized in tabs that snap at the top of the screen as you scroll, so you’ll always know the context of the tab you’re in. “Who to follow” recommendations are mixed in the middle of the Tweets list, while the Photos tab mirrors the grid design found on the iPad. After you follow an account, Twitter takes the opportunity to show more recommendations with an inline box, which surprised me.\n\nTwitter has, effectively, created three timelines for the profile view on iPhone, which I think is a good idea as it simplifies access to them.\n\nThere are also many great design touches in this screen. As you scroll up, the cover photo becomes a title bar that contains the profile’s name and count for the selected tab below; this comes in handy, for instance, to know exactly how many photos you’ve shared on Twitter to date. In your profile, you can also keep pulling down the cover photo to activate the account switcher (which can be done by tapping & holding the Me tab, too).\n\nWhat I found perplexing is, once again, Twitter’s decision to bury lists in a menu that I bet most people won’t even notice. To access lists and list management options in Twitter for iPhone, you need to tap the small Settings icon at the top of your profile, then choose Lists.\n\nI struggled for days to understand where lists were in Twitter for iPhone – obviously, I was under the impression that the icon would let me open my account’s settings, which I didn’t need. I don’t know why Twitter doesn’t care about lists much, but their placement in the iPhone app makes it look like the company run out of space for a button.\n\nEverybody has different needs and preferences when it comes to viewing Twitter profiles, and the three most popular clients differ vastly in this aspect. Twitterrific focuses on the basics; Tweetbot brings easy access to Mentions; Twitter features a lot of shortcuts with a special focus on photos and favorites.\n\nFor my use of Twitter, I prefer the official Twitter app for viewing profiles. In spite of its flaws on the iPad and iPhone, the fast access to *all* photos and favorites, solid recommendations, and revamped design on the iPhone make Twitter’s profiles work better for me.\n\n## Lists\n\nI’ve always liked the idea of creating lists for people and websites I follow on Twitter. It’s too bad that Twitter has somewhat forgotten about lists and hasn’t shipped considerable updates to the product since its original launch.\n\nI have two lists that I want to read every day: one is about videogames; the other focuses on Apple news. In lists, I keep websites and journalists that I don’t want to have in my main timeline – my use of lists is primarily news-oriented and I use them as a tool to group links about the same topic together. Think of it like RSS, but for Twitter, with no unread counts. I’ve always been intrigued by their premise, but most users don’t seem to care (and therefore Twitter doesn’t care). Fortunately, third-party clients do.\n\nTweetbot famously lets you switch your main timeline to a list of your choice: simply tap & hold on the title bar at the top, and Tweetbot will bring up a list switcher to turn any list (private or public) into your timeline so you won’t have to switch to a dedicated section to read a list. This is, by far, the most convenient way to switch to a list I’ve seen in any Twitter client for iOS – especially because different scroll positions are saved and restored every time you move between your timeline and a list.\n\nTweetbot matters for users who value Twitter lists because it makes them first-class citizens that are a core part of the app’s experience. Lists in Tweetbot aren’t tucked away in a settings menu or deep into three layers of navigation; if you want, you can even read two lists at the same time in Tweetbot thanks to its quick-switch timeline gesture.\n\nTwitterrific also treats lists well. Twitterrific can switch from the timeline (called “Home”) to a list through the sidebar on the left; tap your profile picture, scroll, and you’ll find your lists.\n\nAllow me to nitpick: you can’t rearrange the position of lists in the sidebar, so you’ll always have to scroll to the bottom to find them (which can be problematic if you have many saved searches above them); and, there’s no visual differentiation between your lists and lists from others you’ve subscribed to.[❲10❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:10) Once you tap a list, the app switches quickly to its timeline, showing a different icon and the list’s name in the title bar. When viewing a list in Twitterrific for iPhone, the view is modal – shortcuts for mentions and messages at the top disappear completely. Like Tweetbot, scroll position in lists is saved and restored across app relaunches.\n\nI prefer reading lists in Twitterrific for iPad, with a few reservations, again, about visual cues and usage of hollow UI areas. On the iPad, Twitterrific uses the same sidebar concept of the iPhone app, but it uses a split-screen layout with an option to keep the sidebar always visible in landscape mode. You can switch to lists from the sidebar, but, unfortunately, tabs disappear in the title bar on the iPad as well despite the higher amount of space available on screen. This is mitigated by the presence of sidebar shortcuts, but it’s something I noticed.\n\nTwitterrific also lets you tap & hold tabs to customize them like Tweetbot can, with important differences in terms of interface design and amount of customization you can do. The good news: you can change three tabs out of four to display something else, including lists (on the iPad; it’s two out of three on the iPhone). The bad news: it’s not clear that you can do this because there’s no indicator (like the up\/down arrows on tabs in Tweetbot); and, once you’ve switched to a list, you can’t tell from the tab alone which list it is, and there’s no title bar with displayed list name either.\n\nUpon further inspection, it turns out that Twitterrific does tell you which list you’ve switched to via customizable tabs: you have to scroll the sidebar and see which list is selected. This can be considered a minor design issue, but it does matter if you’re a heavy list user and you’re constantly switching between lists.\n\nOverall, I like reading lists in Twitterrific for iPad because I can temporarily switch mentions and favorites to lists, catch up on my news, and send links quickly to other apps with share sheets. Twitterrific may have some questionable UI choices here and there, but the functionality is great. On the iPhone, I prefer Tweetbot.\n\nAnd then there’s the Twitter app, with its aforementioned hidden Lists buttons and no shortcuts to quickly open or switch to lists. It’s a shame that Twitter isn’t putting much thought into easier access to lists on mobile devices: with its new Cards and tweet recommendations, lists could easily become a powerful solution to read and find news through Twitter – something that the likes of [Flipboard](https:\/\/about.flipboard.com\/) and [Nuzzel](http:\/\/nuzzel.com\/) have exploited to a good degree of success. Twitter’s only nice touch is that tabs allow you to move quickly between tweets, members, and subscribers in a list…which pales in comparison to what Twitterrific and Tweetbot are doing.\n\nTwitter lists could be so much more. Off the top of my head: popular tweets and links in a list; a daily summary of news from a specific list; suggested users and websites; full Cards integration; search; list shortcuts in Twitter for iPad’s sidebar; traditional List and Snippet views based on Summary Cards; notifications for lists.\n\nI use lists to find news through Twitter every day, and I know that other people use them in all sorts of different ways. Even just considering the news aspect, there are dozens of ideas that Twitter could explore, but they don’t seem to care, and this is reflected in their iOS app.\n\n### Tweetstorms\n\nOver the past year, a peculiar way of composing multi-tweet messages has become commonplace in the tech Twitter niche: the tweetstorm.\n\nI won’t get into the details of how this term came to be [❲11❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:11), but I find it to be a clever idea if you want to share a thought that doesn’t fit in 140 characters while still making sure multiple tweets can be held together in a thread. And the trick to do a tweetstorm is quite simple: send subsequent tweets in reply to youself.\n\nI don’t know whether I should be proud or ashamed that I bought into tweetstorms, but I use them to share screenshots and quick thoughts when I don’t want to have a full blog post. Lately, I’ve been using tweetstorms (without the ordinal number before each tweet [❲12❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:12) ) to share news before putting together a blog post (and I’ve also started returning to [shortform blogging](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/category\/ios\/) to make sure more thoughts remain on my own website). I’ve seen other users sharing thoughts via tweetstorms and, overall, they’re a fairly simple hack to post longer messages by splitting them up and connecting them back together.\n\nAll three Twitter clients I tried support loading tweetstorms because they let you view threads anyway, but Twitter and Tweetbot are my preferred solutions as they put the last tweet in a tweetstorm directly below or above the previous ones sent by you, hiding replies by other users until you scroll. Twitter lets you swipe up from the last tweet in a tweetstorm to see the tweets you’ve replied to, while Tweetbot shows original tweets directly below the last one, with no replies.\n\nThe difference is minor, but Twitterrific starts scrolling at the top where replies by other users are shown, which is slightly less optimal if you’re a tweetstorm power user. Which, I realize, doesn’t sound as good as I thought it would.[❲13❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:13)\n\n## Direct Messages\n\nIf I had to pick the communication service that I’ve used most frequently, consistently, and joyfully over the past five years, it would be Twitter DMs. But I’m sad, because Twitter never fully understood the potential that lies in the simplicity of DMs.\n\nDirect messages on Twitter are based on a great concept: they’re limited to 140 characters and they don’t require you to learn and manage separate email addresses. The ability to message people is always there – but only people you follow can message you back. These three simple limitations remove the majority of cruft and complications that make email frustrating and hard to manage. Direct messages are fast, short, and reciprocal.\n\nYou could say that Twitter never grasped the great messaging system they had invented or that they didn’t want to alter its simplicity. I find it difficult to believe that Twitter applied willful restraint to DM development considering [the sad state](http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/11\/18\/7239119\/twitter-url-messaging) in which they left the feature for a year, but I digress.\n\nSince 2009, I’ve been using DMs to communicate with all sorts of people. Friends, developers, other writers, readers – DMs have allowed me to skip email and be able to send short and direct texts without the layer of email, iMessage, phone numbers, or other messaging protocols. I remember when developers tried to make dedicated DM clients into sustainable apps [❲14❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:14), and to say that I’ve had hundreds of valuable conversations via DM would be an understatement. Twitter is my Facebook and DMs are an essential part of it.\n\nWhich brings me to Twitter clients and how they handle DMs, threaded conversations, and the ability to share links and media with other users privately. I’ll start from my (obvious) favorite in this case: the Twitter app.\n\nTwitter has long ignored DMs, but they recently reinstated the ability to share links and [promised](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2014\/coming-soon-to-twitter) to bring various enhancements to the product in the future. Over the past year, the company rolled out the ability to [share photos via DM](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2013\/photos-in-direct-messages-and-swipe-between-timelines) and added a button to quickly send a tweet to someone else via DM in Twitter for iPhone. Twitter has an API advantage over third-party clients: the reason I prefer Twitter for DMs are features that third-party apps can’t implement – especially the ability to share a photo via DM.\n\nDirect messages have a standalone tab in Twitter for iPhone. Conversations are sorted from newest to oldest, and threads are displayed in chronological order; this Messages-like display has become the de facto standard for hundreds of other messaging apps, and it’s the one that I like.\n\nIn the conversation view, timestamps are shown by default and the recipient’s avatar is tappable so you can open their profile. You can also tap & hold a message to bring up options to copy, delete, or flag it; when typing a message, a character counter is displayed in the right corner of the compose field.\n\nOver the past couple of months, the ability to share photos via DM has become essential to how I communicate with people on Twitter. Perhaps I just want to point out a typo or website issue to a friend, or maybe I need to quickly send a bug report with a screenshot to a developer – photos in DMs allow me to ping people without the annoyance of email or the burden of downtimes and read receipts on iMessage. I use photos in DMs extensively, although I wish I could send multiple photos privately instead of just one at a time.\n\nWhat really is impressive about DMs in the official Twitter app, though, is the history of private conversations it lets you browse. In third-party clients, DM history is always cut off at some point both for conversations and messages inside a thread – I would guess it’s another API limitation for the number of historical data that is returned to clients.\n\nIn the Twitter app, you can view your entire history of direct messages: I was able to scroll back to old messages in conversations and I went all the way back to mid–2009 to read DMs from when I had just started writing for MacStories. I wasn’t aware of the fact that DM history could be accessed in the Twitter app – like search, it looks like a massive technical undertaking and I’m impressed by how fast everything loads even when viewing messages from six years ago.\n\nThere’s a certain irony to the fact that the only private messages I can retrieve from 2009 are Twitter DMs and IMAP email.\n\nIf you’ve been reading MacStories and [listening to Connected](http:\/\/www.relay.fm\/connected\/13), you know how much I care about data and software preservation for posterity, which is why I was excited to find out about DM archives in Twitter. This amount of data, however, begs for better tools to filter messages and search inside conversations, which are absent from the current version of the Twitter app. While Twitter is fast at loading conversations, it is tedious to scroll all the way back to 2012 to load messages from a couple of years ago, and, if Twitter really cares about improvements to DMs, I hope search and filters will be on their list.[❲15❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:15)\n\nThere’s a “but” in Twitter’s full DM history: it’s only available on the iPhone, as the iPad app is limited to roughly the same set of DMs I get in third-party clients. The iPad app comes with the same features found on the iPhone (including photos), but, for me, it only shows direct messages from the past few months. It could be that Twitter is rolling out the ability to view more DMs gradually, but I wouldn’t be surprised to know this is one of the features that got left behind in the company’s prioritization of the iPhone app over the iPad version.\n\nAn example of a feature that’s only been launched on Twitter for iPhone is a shortcut to quickly share a tweet via DM. This isn’t a big deal: you can tap & hold on a tweet and share it via DM, which, in practice, will send a message with the URL of a tweet attached.\n\nWhat is interesting about this is that a) it’s limited to the iPhone, more proof that Twitter for iPad isn’t where Twitter’s iOS team likes to experiment; and b) tweet URLs get a special treatment in DMs. Tweets shared via direct message get a nicely formatted snippet view in conversations, showing a preview of the tweet inline without having to tap it. This is a reiteration of the idea of bringing content to the user in the Twitter apps, and, while far from indicative of Cards coming to DMs, the feature does suggest that different media\/preview types could be potentially supported in private conversations.\n\nAs you would guess at this point, Twitter for iPad seldom takes advantage of its own sidebar, and there’s no DM shortcut in there, leaving a single button in the profile page the only way to open the Messages screen. At least Twitter put in some work for this view, which takes advantage of the iPad to display messages in a sidebar on the left.\n\nIn Tweetbot, DMs are available from a button in the middle of the tab bar and, due to the Twitter API, they’re limited to recent messages – I can’t go back and view my entire history of direct messaging in Tweetbot.\n\nThere are some shortcuts and design choices that I like about DMs in Tapbots’ app. I’m a big fan of the double-tap gesture to mark messages as read. In conversations, Tweetbot lets you tap individual messages to bring up a custom menu to delete, copy, email, and translate, but you can also tap & hold links shared via DM to use the system share sheet. Unlike the Twitter app, DM conversations can be shared over email, but you can’t share photos privately.\n\nAnother substantial difference between Twitter and Tweetbot is how they implement the DM compose experience when you’re starting a new message from scratch without using shortcuts from tweets or profile pages.\n\nWhen you tap the compose button in the top right corner of Tweetbot’s Messages screen, the app asks if you want to create a new tweet or a direct message – the button is the same throughout the app, so Tapbots decided to keep it consistent in DMs and ask the user for input upon tapping it. Choosing the DM option reveals a screen that lets you pick a recipient, although it’s not clear how, exactly, Tweetbot picks users to display in this screen; in my experience, some of the suggested recipients are people I follow, but others are not.\n\nYou can filter this list with a search bar at the top, or you can scroll to the bottom for a Find User option that contains another search bar for global username search as well as shortcuts to pick recipients from your followers or people you follow. Tweetbot offers plenty of options to compose new DMs, but sometimes they’re confusing or redundant.\n\nTwitter is less versatile, but obvious. The compose button is replaced by a message button in the DM screen, which defaults to creating a new DM. Tapping it brings up a list of your recent DM contacts, which is handy, with the keyboard focused in a search field. You can start typing to filter people you follow in real-time, or you can manually type a username and tap it to start a new conversation.\n\nTweetbot may offer more shortcuts to compose new DMs, but Twitter’s simplicity feels more consistent and it makes sense. And besides features, a small design detail represents my affinity for Twitter’s DM experience: messages you’ve replied to have a reply icon on the right, while others don’t.\n\nThis brings me to Twitterrific, whose DM view is one of my least favorite aspects of the app. Of the three Twitter clients, Twitterrific is the only one to adopt a non-traditional display of DMs: they’re not threaded by conversation, but they’re displayed as individual replies from newest to oldest, and they’re all colored in blue and light blue depending on status and selection.\n\nMy problem is that I’m used to interacting with DMs as conversations modelled after Apple’s Messages app, whereas Twitterrific treats direct messages as special tweets, displayed in their own timeline. The interactions with DMs in Twitterrific are completely different than Twitter and Tweetbot, which can be a plus if you want to have a unique visualization of private messaging. It just doesn’t work for me.\n\nYou can swipe on a message to reply to it or show the thread in reverse chronological order; these two modes can also be activated by tapping buttons that appear when you select a message (the same interaction you have with regular tweets in the normal timeline). When in reply mode, the recipient’s name is shown in the title bar, the message you’re replying to is quoted at the bottom, and character count is placed in the bottom right.\n\nThis design means that Twitterrific can’t show you a full conversation when you’re typing a message.\n\nLike Twitter, Twitterrific shows an indicator for messages you’ve replied to, but because the view is made of single messages with no threads and everything is either blue or light blue, the reply indicator loses most of its meaning.\n\nI get what The Iconfactory is going after with their DM experience – they want to replicate the timeline for consistency. However, there’s something inherently dangerous about private conversations, and Twitterrific’s DM view always makes me feel nervous or confused. I’m not always 100% sure I’m sending a DM or looking at an ongoing conversation, and I believe that the ungrouping of direct messages for a timeline-like experience is more beneficial to the developers’ sense of order than a practical use case.\n\nThe Thread view of DMs is another example. Twitterrific can show you a thread of direct messages, but they’re treated like tweets instead of traditional message threads. You can share a discussion via email, copy it as plain text, and you can even tap & hold messages to bring up the system share sheet, but there’s nothing – besides color – that Twitterrific uses to meaningfully differentiate tweets from private messages here. To understand the downside of this approach, try this: open a DM thread, swipe left on a message to view its thread, keep swiping on messages this way, and you’ll stack private DM threads on top of each other endlessly.\n\nI use DMs a lot, and I think that Apple’s thread view first implemented in the Messages app is a superior interface for displaying conversations with people. Nowadays, every major messaging app or platform uses the threaded conversation view to handle display of texts exchanged between people, and, by this factor alone, The Iconfactory’s decision to not adopt this standard is confusing and, for me, not useful.\n\nTherefore, in choosing betwen Tweetbot and Twitter for DMs, I prefer the official Twitter app on the iPhone because of its ability to display old messages, shortcuts to share tweets, and, most importantly, new photo sharing options. Tweetbot has more shortcuts, but, unfortunately, it is limited to what it can implement in direct messages, and I’ve come to enjoy and depend on the possibility to share photos in DMs.\n\n## Uploading Photos\n\nMy biggest frustration with the Twitter app for iOS is that, at its “High” option in the Settings, it can’t upload full-res versions of my photos. Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and even Apple’s share sheet using the native Twitter photo service can upload (slightly) higher quality versions of my files, and I don’t know why this is the case. I understand that Twitter may not want the entire world to share full-res pictures, but their High setting isn’t high enough and their compression is generally too aggressive.\n\nThe benefit of using the Twitter app for photos is the ability to share multiple photos, GIFs, and tag users in photos (which I’ve never needed). While I enjoy the fact that Twitter for iOS always gets all the latest photo features (like better editing tools and effects built-in), I’m sad every time a good picture turns into a compressed mess.\n\nA nice detail of the Twitter app is that it displays a progress bar underneath the title bar when you’re posting a tweet that contains images – it’s subtle, and a welcome addition to the posting experience.\n\nThird-party clients, on the other hand, offer support for third-party services that either have less terrible image compression or don’t compress images at all. Twitterrific has img.ly, Mobypicture, and Droplr uploads; Tweetbot comes with CloudApp, Droplr, img.ly, Mobypicture, yfrog, and custom endpoints if you want to use your own server.\n\n[Droplr](https:\/\/droplr.com\/) seems to be the most popular alternative image sharing service for Tweetbot and Twitterrific users. [Droplr is a great sharing service](http:\/\/thesweetsetup.com\/apps\/favorite-file-sharing-service\/) in general, and images uploaded to it always load at full-resolution in third-party clients, often without having to open a web view.\n\nAs much as I like full-size screenshots and photos in my tweets, I’ve tried a number of third-party image sharing services over the years, and inevitably they all disappear, are acquired and start asking for money, or the short URLs used for images break and can’t be viewed anymore. My Twitter archive is full of images uploaded to a third-party service that, yes, may have offered full-res uploads and other cool integrations – but now those links are broken and I can’t view those images anymore. They’re gone, forever, and I don’t know when and how I lost them, exactly.\n\nPartially, it’s my fault because I forgot to renew domains for short URLs or simply jumped from service to service without caring enough. But still, for my next five years of Twitter I’d like to keep all my shared photos retrievable and preservable, which is why I’m sticking to native Twitter photos in spite of their poor quality.\n\nA compressed image is still better than no image five years from now. That doesn’t mean that Twitter won’t ever do something crazy with my photos, but, by always using native Twitter photos, I can remove possible points of failure and I can enjoy a nice integration with the Twitter website and apps for all my images.\n\n## Discover\n\nI’ve always had a theory: if an article is good enough, it’ll come to me through RSS and Twitter. That’s been generally true over the years, but it discards the fact that I follow hundreds of websites and over a thousand users on Twitter. Which is why, I believe, companies like Twitter and Facebook want better discovery tools for the majority of their users.\n\nBy “discovery”, I mean technologies and design choices aimed at facilitating the process of finding interesting stuff without much work. Users shouldn’t have to follow 1000 accounts to never miss a good article; the network should be able to figure out what users want and give it to them. All the talk about curation, discovery, and serendipity ultimately comes down to the fact that Twitter and Facebook want people to be happy with their service because it lets them find stuff relevant to their interests, which keeps them hooked. That’s not necessarily evil – my job is essentially based on discovering links, and any improvement to that process is welcome.\n\nTwitter has various discovery-related features built into the app, and all of this is completely unavailable to third-party developers. Both Twitterrific and Tweetbot focus solely on displaying tweets from lists or timelines they can load because they can’t access the algorithm that provides suggestions for users and tweets.\n\nThe Twitter app has an entire section dedicated to this, aptly called Discover. It can be accessed by swiping left on the main timeline in the iPhone app and through a sidebar shortcut on the iPad. The swipe gesture, which has historically been dedicated to interacting with tweets in third-party clients, is the only way to open the Discover section on the iPhone.\n\nRecommendations in Discover have, for me, been organic and accurate: I usually find suggested users, tweets about topics I care about, old retweets I may have missed, tweets faved by people I follow, and other users followed by people I follow. It’s a very variegated section, always providing tweets that tend to match my interests or at least be relevant from a newsworthy perspective. Suggestions are tailored for me because they’re based on my timeline and following list – very rarely I find a tweet in there that I absolutely have zero interest in.\n\nThe Discover section also displays trending topics and ads. Ads can be promoted trends, tweets, or users, and I’m not particularly disturbed by them. On one occasion, I received a promoted trend about the PlayStation 20th anniversary, which I tapped and found rather interesting as it was about genuine tweets from people remembering the console in Italy (it had been promoted by @PlayStation). I should say that I’ve never been into the idea of trending topics and barely participated in a few ones over the years.\n\nAfter I started using Twitter for iOS full-time, I was surprised by the fact that you can always reload the Discover section to get a fresh set of suggestions. That didn’t make sense to me because I was used to the idea of reaching the top of a timeline and stopping when there was nothing new to see anymore, but now I get it. There is no “top” in the Discover section, as it’s been built to constantly refresh and give you tweets or users you may be interested in.\n\nI don’t open the Discover section every day. When I do, I’m surprised by the quality of its recommendations and I’ve discovered interesting articles and users thanks to it, but I don’t feel like I need to open it on a daily basis. Like lists, Twitter could do more to give users better tools to discover interesting tweets: there is no topic organization for the Discover section, no daily or weekly recaps, no connections between related users and topics.\n\nThe Activity tab, which sits next to Discover on the iPhone and is a subsection of it on the iPad, offers a much simpler message: it shows you tweets and users people you follow have favorited or followed. That’s it. I always find cool stuff in the Activity tab, and Twitter should take a cue from its simplicity to bring some clarity to the Discover section, which is nice, but somewhat confusionary.\n\nApps like [Nuzzel](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/nuzzel-for-iphone-lets-you-catch-up-on-news-from-twitter\/) and [Digg](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/iphone\/digging-digg\/) are showing how links and topics can be collected from a user’s Twitter timeline, remixed, and displayed in different ways. I personally depend on Nuzzel and it seems absurd to me that Twitter hasn’t acquired the company or built a similar tool for its own apps yet – it’s such an obvious idea, perfectly designed for Twitter.\n\nThe Discover section may seem like a useless thing to those who are used to Tweetbot and Twitterrific, but I actually find it pretty cool and useful and it gives me solid recommendations every time I open it. I just wish that Twitter did more of it.\n\n## Muting\n\nBeing able to mute specific users is an important feature for many as it grants the benefit of not seeing certain tweets without unfollowing. In other cases, muting hashtags and keywords puts up a filter that prevents tweets matching those criteria from being displayed altogether, saving up valuable space in the timeline.\n\nTwitter recently added the ability to mute users so you won’t see their tweets in your timeline but you’ll still be able to receive notifications from them. In the iOS app, you can mute by tapping & holding a user’s profile picture or tweet in the timeline and pressing the Mute button; otherwise, you can go to their profile page and mute them from the menu next to the Follow button. Muted users won’t know they’ve been muted, and they will get a red mute indicator on their profile that you can tap to unmute them at any time.\n\nTwitter’s mute feature is the simplest possible implementation: there’s no way to see all muted users in a list and you can’t mute hashtags or keywords of your choice. Power users will think mute is an afterthought for Twitter, but I’m glad it’s there.\n\nTwitterrific has what it’s called “muffling” users – [a custom implementation of muting](http:\/\/support.iconfactory.com\/kb\/twitterrific\/muffling-in-twitterrific-5) that works in the same way of the Twitter app, but it’s proprietary to Twitterrific. You can muffle users, domains, and hashtags, and you can do so from profile pages (for users) or by tapping on the “More” button (three dots) on a tweet. I struggled to find the option to muffle hashtags and domains in tweets because of this hidden menu, but the ability to block specific websites without writing a regular expression is a great addition to the app.\n\nThe profile page of a muffled user doesn’t show this status, but you can tap the icon again to find “Cancel Muffle” as an option.\n\nContrary to Twitter, Twitterrific shows muffled tweets in the timeline as minimized tweets with username and muffle icon but no text. This is an interesting idea: Twitterrific is showing you the result of your muffling with the option of expanding a tweet if you still want to see what a muffled tweet contains. Twitterrific doesn’t put any special indicator on a muffled tweet you’ve expanded, but that’s a minor problem. The app’s implementation of muting is handy and unique.\n\nTweetbot destroys the competition when it comes to advanced mute options. Taptbots’ client offers a wide selection of mute filters that span users, hashtags, clients, keywords, and even regular expressions if you want to make sure you never see a specific string of text in your timeline. Tweetbot’s mute filters are even shareable if you want to allow other people to install them easily in their Tweetbot; like Twitterrific, this is a custom implementation that doesn’t apply to mute settings in your Twitter account.\n\nIn Tweetbot, you can mute users by tapping & holding their profile pictures in the timeline (this also works for hashtags) or a gear icon on their profile page. Tweetbot is the only client to provide a second layer of muting with time-based filters: you can mute for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, or forever – and these apply to all types of mute filters, but you can’t specify a custom time period.\n\nYou can also view a dedicated Mute Filters section by accessing it from the app’s tab bar; in this screen, you’ll be able to delete filters, edit them, and share them (tap & hold one). Additionally, you can tap Edit and then “+” in the top left to bring up a menu to mute a client or a keyword. The latter lets you enter type a keyword you want to mute, shows you matching tweets in the timeline that’s currently loaded in the app, and optionally lets you mute mentions too.\n\nFor advanced users, Tweetbot offers further control and customization by supporting regular expressions for keyword filters ( [I had a few](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/tweetbot-mute-filters-for-u-s-elections\/) for topics and websites I never wanted to see).\n\nThe ability to mute clients is interesting: of the three apps, Tweetbot is the only one left that can display what client each tweet was sent from, and you can tap & hold the client’s name to mute it (also doable from the aforementioned Mute Filters screen). This can be useful if you want to mute specific clients that websites and other organizations may use to send tweets you don’t want to see.\n\nUntil last year, I thought that muting was absolutely necessary to me because I wanted to avoid the awkward situation of unfollowing someone and then being asked why I did so. For years, I muted users I didn’t want to unfollow just because I felt bad. But over the past 12 months, I’ve realized that, of all the things one could feel bad for in this world, unfollowing someone on Twitter shouldn’t be one of them. I don’t want to overthink about the fact that I can’t unfollow users because of uncomfortable follow-ups via email. Twitter has an Unfollow button, and I started using it more when I know I don’t want to see someone’s tweets in my timeline anymore –just like I know others are doing with me or MacStories. And that’s okay.\n\nBut, I also understand that other people want to avoid the possible awkwardness of unfollowing someone. And I know that, unlike me, there are people who can’t stand seeing tweets about sports or TV shows or other topics in their timelines. I used to be one of them. It could be that I’ve become more patient, or maybe I don’t have the energy to keep up with my mute filters anymore – I just scroll past tweets that don’t interest me and go on with my day.\n\nI’m fine with the Twitter app and its basic mute feature (I only use it for a few accounts that people keep retweeting), but I recommend Tweetbot to everyone else who needs powerful filters and more advanced options. Tweetbot’s offerings are impressive in this regard, and more developers should take a look at what Tapbots built to ensure users can be in control of the content that appears in their timelines.\n\n## Fave and RT Counts\n\nI like to know when tweets are popular by looking at their fave and RT counts. I appreciate the ego boost that results from seeing many faves for a joke I just tweeted and I want to know when other people’s tweets are popular so I know I’m not missing something important and\/or funny. The Twitter app is the best client at displaying counts because of API limitations on third-parties *and* their own design decisions.\n\nLet’s start with Twitterrific, which doesn’t display any count for retweets or favorites. The app has no detail view for individual tweets, and there isn’t any section to view how many times any given tweet has been retweeted or faved by other users. Twitterrific simply isn’t an option if you want to see these counts.\n\nIn Tweetbot, you need to swipe left on a tweet in the timeline to view fave and retweet counts below its text. For your own tweets, Tweetbot can show you people who retweeted or faved a tweet upon tapping one of the numbers; in this list, each user is displayed with their followers and following counts, so you can quickly know if someone popular retweeted you if you’re receiving an influx of RTs.\n\nHowever, Tweetbot has a major limitation for counts on other users’ tweets: it can’t display the list of people who favorited a tweet on tweets posted by other users. Instead, tapping the fave counter on tweets not sent by you will open an inline Favstar page, which is often not as accurate as the native data returned by Twitter. I believe this is another limitation of the Twitter API; so, while the implementation isn’t great and you’ll still need to open a tweet to view counts, at least Tapbots is doing the best they can with Tweetbot.\n\nWhen I was first started using Twitter for iPhone, I thought the idea of displaying retweet and fave counts for each tweet was crazy. After years of Tweetie and Tweetbot, I was used to a perfectly clean timeline with tweets displayed as textual updates, perhaps inline previews for images, but no extraneous interface elements visible without tapping or swiping on a tweet first. The fact that Twitter wanted to inject counts in each tweet for “engagement” purposes was sacrilege at best.\n\nTo my surprise, though, I soon started enjoying the ability to discern a tweet’s popularity without tapping on it first and being taken into a separate view. And now that I’ve been using the official app for a few months, it’s hard to go back to clients that don’t instantly show me counts for faves and retweets – it’s similar to the absence of cards in third-party apps, but amplified by the fact that I’m a sucker for faves.\n\nIt’s interesting how a simple interface change has altered my interactions on a network I’ve been using for years. Thanks to more easily available counts, I am discovering more interesting links because I’m missing fewer of them – I scroll my timeline with more attention and I skim less. Retweet and fave counts are direct indicators of popularity and interest that don’t require to be guessed – they’re always there, and while they don’t magically “fix” discovery of cool tweets, they help in ensuring you don’t easily miss *stuff*. \n\nThey’re a good example of how practical design trumps idealistic interfaces: in theory, a cleaner timeline is better, but, in practice, I’ve discovered that always-visible counts make me faster (less tapping around) and more attentive.\n\nTwitter’s RT and fave counts, however, aren’t just static indicators – they’re buttons. I can fave any tweet with one tap just by pressing the star icon, and I can retweet with two taps (there’s a confirmation step in between).\n\nMy understanding is that Twitter’s main intention was to let you easily engage with tweets through retweets and faves, but the buttons also made for nice indicators besides the interactive part. When you tap those buttons in the Twitter timeline, you aren’t taken to a list of people who retweeted or faved a tweet. To see the list of users, you have to tap a tweet (not swipe on it) so you’ll be taken to a detail view with larger previews, more buttons, replies, and full RT\/fave counts.\n\nTap the counts, and you’ll see all users who have interacted with a tweet. Both on the iPad and iPhone, these lists show users with no bios or follower counts (unlike Tweetbot); as you would expect, there are buttons to quickly follow users with one tap.\n\nI was fiercely opposed to the idea of having buttons and counts cluttering up my Twitter timeline. With time, not only have Twitter’s buttons grown on me because I like seeing RTs and faves at any time – I am slower and less efficient in Twitter clients that don’t put RT and fave indicators\/shortcuts a quick tap away. Twitter’s timeline may not be minimal or true to to Tweetie’s roots, but it works better because it puts the focus on interaction without complications.\n\n## Search\n\nI rely on Twitter search to monitor tweets about MacStories, articles I publish, and other keywords related to the websites I run. More importantly, I believe in the value of older tweets as reference material for editorials and news, which is why I need to check Twitter search for tweets that go back in time.\n\nUntil recently, I would have recommended Tweetbot for the best implementation of Twitter search and [Tweet Library to browse the Twitter archive](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweet-library-and-the-twitter-archive\/), but an update that Twitter recently rolled out has completely changed the scenario.\n\n> The Twitter Search API is part of Twitter’s v1.1 REST API. It allows queries against the indices of recent or popular Tweets and behaves similarily to, but not exactly like the Search feature available in Twitter mobile or web clients, such as Twitter.com search.  \n\nThird-party Twitter clients have a finite number of search results [returned by the Twitter search API](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/rest\/public\/search). This means that Twitterrific and Tweetbot cannot look for every tweet ever sent – they’re limited to the past few weeks (at best). This has always been the case with the Twitter API, and it’s not under the developers’ control.\n\nWith this in mind, both apps have done a good job at offering handy search features for tweets, trends, and users. In Tweetbot, you can access saved searches, view nearby tweets, view trends worldwide and regionally, and browse suggested users by category.\n\nI love two aspects of Tweetbot’s search: results are color-coded and you can restrict search results to tweets or users containing a specific string of text. The first one is useful for me so I can find tweets that mention my name without being a reply: tweets that contain “viticci”, aren’t blue, and aren’t sent by me including my last name without my @username. This is usually someone who deeply disagrees with me. The Twitter app doesn’t make it easy to parse tweets through color because it has no tweet highlighting.\n\nWhen you hit the search bar in Tweetbot and start typing, the app will offer to look for users that contain that text in their name, tweets where that text appears, or it can let you go directly to a valid username you typed. The first shortcut is fantastic if you want to see a group of usernames that share a similar name or if you only partially remember a username.[❲16❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:16)\n\nTwitterrific puts shortcuts to saved searches in the sidebar and its search screen lets you find people, trends, and tweets. Twitterrific has fewer options than Tweetbot as it goes for a friendlier, more visual approach – users, for instance, are shown as a grid of large profile pictures with no counts or other information before tapping them.\n\nSearch in the Twitter app is on another level because Twitter has enhanced it and locked it down with no API access. The first big difference, though, isn’t technical – it’s in the *design* of the feature. Search is always accessible in the title bar of the Twitter app (except in the DM screen) with an icon next to the compose button. The placement of this icon immediately suggests that search is important to the company – or at least they want it to be.\n\nWhen you tap the search icon, the app shows a list of recent and saved searches; on the iPad, this happens in a popover. As you start typing, the app shows suggestions for older searches you performed, users, and popular searches. You can tap one of these results and be taken to the relevant user or search results page.\n\nSearch results are split in Top Tweets and All Tweets. The former shows a mix of best results, suggested users, and photos shared alongside tweets relevant to that search; the other tab shows all tweets in reverse chronological order. I’m usually able to find a tweet I remember through the Top results, which tend to be accurate and are handy shortcuts.\n\nFilters is where it gets more interesting. The Twitter app lets you refine results by hitting the filter icon in the search bar at the top, and you can use the following criteria to narrow results to specific tweets:\n\n* Photos\n* Videos\n* News\n* People\n* Collections (also searches Lists)\n* All People\/People you follow\n* Everywhere\/near you\n\nThese are powerful filters, and available right on the iPhone and iPad. I use them often to refine results to links and combine them with a search query to, say, find a specific article a person I follow tweeted.\n\nThis all comes together with the fact that Twitter recently launched [a fully searchable archive of every tweet ever sent](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/you-can-now-search-for-every-tweet-ever-sent-in-the-twitter-app\/), available exclusively in the native Twitter apps. You can now look for every tweet ever posted to Twitter directly from the iOS app and find results from years ago in seconds. This is an amazing capability and impressive technical achievement – especially considering how well it works.\n\nAs [I wrote when Twitter rolled out the new search](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/you-can-now-search-for-every-tweet-ever-sent-in-the-twitter-app\/):\n\n> For me, there’s tremendous value in being able to easily retrieve old tweets: I’ve [written about the Twitter archive before](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweet-library-and-the-twitter-archive\/), but today’s rollout brings retrieval of indexed tweets to the search section of the Twitter app – no need to download an archive. Twitter search used to be limited to tweets from the past couple of weeks; now, you can look for *every* public tweet sent since 2006.  \n\n> In my first tests using Twitter for iPhone, I was able to find the [first tweet I ever sent](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/1212386486) through search in a couple of seconds by simply typing words contained in its text. I then looked for other old tweets I remembered from 2009 and 2010, and the app brought them up instantly. Retweet and fave counts were correct, but I couldn’t load replies to those old tweets in the Twitter app.  \n\nYou can combine full search with advanced search operators to refine results from the entire Twitter history so you can, for instance, find a tweet sent by a user on a specific day. I don’t know what Twitter plans to do with search – it’s hard to imagine how casual users would want this kind of advanced functionality – but, for me, the additions have been beneficial to what I need to do with Twitter search.[❲17❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:17)\n\nUltimately, this is why I prefer search in the official Twitter app: it lets me find any tweet I want on my iPhone and iPad, it’s fast, and it can auto-complete search queries for me. Search in Twitterrific and Tweetbot has some nice touches and hidden details, but what Twitter is offering in their app is too essential for my workflow.\n\n## Timeline\n\nTwitterrific and Tweetbot, either because of limitations or design decisions, have a traditional display of the Twitter timeline. Tweets from people you follow and retweets are shown in the timeline, with no external contaminations from ads [❲18❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:18) or tweets that don’t respect the classic reverse chronological order.\n\nTwitterrific deserves a special mention because it supports theme customization and a unified timeline. The latter is one of the app’s unique features, as it lets you include mentions and direct messages in the Home timeline. I was never able to use the unified timeline on a daily basis because of the amount of mentions and messages that would make it impossible for me to quickly read tweets from people I follow. The ability to switch to a dark mode and customize fonts is also very nice, and a must-have if you can’t use apps with white interfaces and small fonts.\n\nTweetbot also supports switching to a dark theme, but it doesn’t offer the same amount of options found in Twitterrific.\n\nTwitter, on other hand, is changing the timeline entirely to show you tweets that go beyond the people you follow.\n\nAnd I actually like it.\n\nComing from five years of traditional timeline, seeing it change from the order I was used to was a shock. Tweets have to be shown from oldest to newest and nothing can change that rule – I think pretty much every Tweetbot and Twitterrific user can agree on this. The great thing about Twitter is its simplicity: you can see events unfold in real time because of the nature of the timeline and, unlike Facebook’s News Feed, you have a sense of place in a timeline that lacks any sort of modification.\n\nTwitter has started changing the timeline with the infamous blue line – a way to put conversations back at the top by connecting a reply to its original tweet with a vertical line. But because both the first tweet and reply are shown in the timeline, this means that the Twitter app can show you tweets from 1 minute ago, then one from 19 minutes ago, then back to recent tweets from a minute ago. This happens when a recent reply is sent to an older tweet, which is pushed back to the top of the timeline alongside its reply, all held together by a line. When Twitter rolled out this feature, I hated it.\n\nHow can you *not* hate the blue line if you’re used to the traditional timeline? Tweets are never older tweets – they’re new ones. Historically, Twitter clients have always allowed you to swipe or tap to load a tweet’s detail view and associated thread in case of conversations; Tweetie did this, and both Twitterrific and Tweetbot follow this rule.\n\nThe blue line disrupts the traditional concept of the timeline: it sacrifices the intrinsic simplicity of the Twitter stream for the ability to catch up on past conversations and retain context, but this has the nasty consequence of showing the original tweets multiple times in different places if people you follow keep replying to them.\n\nHere’s the thing, though: I have discovered tweets I had missed thanks to the blue line. Whether for tweets I didn’t see because it was the weekend or updates that I just skimmed and ignored, Twitter’s insistence on pushing tweets to the top through the blue line allowed me to discover valuable conversations because of replies that I would have ignored otherwise. I know that this is an unpopular opinion, and it takes a lot of time to get used to it, but the blue line does make sense once you learn to accept it.\n\nThis isn’t to say that it’s perfect. Twitter could (and should) find ways to make original tweets less obtrusive and repeat them less, or perhaps devise ways to minimize them over time so you don’t see the same tweet five times over two minutes. Because the Twitter app lacks timeline streaming (Twitterrific and Tweetbot have it), it’s also confusing that, upon refreshing, you see tweets moving from their original place to the top because they’re being yanked by the blue line.\n\nAnd yet, in spite of its design and implementation problems [❲19❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:19), I like the blue line. It does clutter my timeline, but it has allowed me to find good tweets I missed, and it wouldn’t be fair to say that it’s “wrong” or “useless” on principle.\n\nBut the blue line isn’t the only tool that Twitter is leveraging to make timelines break out of their reverse chronological mold. As the company recently [announced](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2014\/the-spirit-of-experimentation-and-the-evolution-of-your-home-timeline), they are experimenting with different ways to include relevant tweets based on activity from accounts that you already follow – in other words, putting tweets from accounts you don’t follow based on interactions from the ones you do follow. The primary motivation is, according to Twitter, related to the fact that people don’t want to cautiously cultivate their own timeline over the years. It’s easy to imagine why the casual Twitter user who [reads Twitter.com while being logged out](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/10\/27\/twitters-next-targets-for-monetization-are-logged-out-and-casual-visitors\/) would ever want to manually follow hundreds of people.\n\nTwitter is working on an instant personalized timeline [❲20❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#fn:20) that you don’t need to set up, but their willingness to bring discovery of tweets and users to the timeline is trickling down to existing users who have an account and already follow people. Like many others, I’ve started seeing tweets from accounts I don’t follow pop into my timeline based on what another person saves or follows. External tweets (as I call them) I’ve seen always came with a reason attached – “Joe favorited” and “Kyle follows” indicate why a tweet is being included in the timeline.\n\nIn my experience, these relevant tweets have been mostly good – I’d say 70% of the time I either laughed at a funny favorite I was being shown or got interested in opening the profile page of a user I didn’t know. The other 30% of external tweets were either American sports or duplicate tweets that I had already seen but that a person marked as favorite.\n\nTwitter knows a lot about me. It is the web service I’ve used the most since 2009 and I would guess that they have a fairly accurate snapshot of my location, interests, sense of humor, political orientation, taste in foods, and spending habits. Just by scanning my tweets sent between 2009 and 2014, Twitter could understand which electronic devices I bought and which models, or when I tend to buy videogames during the year and on which platforms. They have a treasure trove of data about me, which is fed every day with more engagement and interactions. They can use it.\n\nI don’t mind the external tweet injections in my timeline. Like the blue line, I’ve grown to like them because they let me discover tweets that tend to be relevant to my interests or at least somewhat compatible with my tastes. Their algorithms are admittedly pretty good, and I’ve started following new people since Twitter began showing me different tweets in my timeline. Recommendations aren’t perfect: at this point, Twitter should know that I have no interest in the NFL or American politics, but tweets about them keep occasionally appearing.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I noticed that Twitter injects external tweets more during slow timeline moments than, say, in a typical Wednesday afternoon full of updates from people I follow. Tweets that have been favorited by others (by far, the external tweets I see the most) are more present at night, when my timeline is slower and more sparse. I think that’s a good idea to have “something for everyone at any time on Twitter”, as the company [says](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2014\/coming-soon-to-twitter).\n\nI’m also in the strange position of an Italian who doesn’t follow Italian websites and behaves like an American because of his job and Internet friends. This, I believe, is what influences the amount of promoted tweets (ads) that I see in the Twitter app on a daily basis.\n\nThis is an important aspect for many users of third-party clients, which don’t show ads in the timeline. In my tests over the past months, I’ve seen an average of 5–10 ads in my timeline each day, but every time I talk about this on Twitter or Connected readers and listeners tell me that they see many, many more, to the point where the app is unusable because of ads. I don’t know why I’m seeing fewer ads, but my impression is that my Twitter account must be confusing to advertisers. As I said above, I’ve grown used to naturally skimming ads on the web through the years, and doing the same in Twitter isn’t much different than most blogs I read.\n\nThe Twitter timeline was built to be a reflection of a Following list people could build meticulously over time. But as it approches its ninth anniversary, Twitter has realized that curating a list of accounts isn’t most people’s forte, and they want to make sure that the timeline stays interesting even without investing time into finding accounts to follow. And that meant breaking the original concept of the timeline to include content and account suggestions. It meant to make the Twitter timeline a little more like Facebook.\n\nThis sounds like blasphemy to longtime Twitter users. And I completely understand: the idea of the timeline was a sacred one, especially for people who have invested hours over the years in following other people and trimming the uninteresting branches of their following lists.\n\nBut, after trying Twitter’s timeline for the past six months, I have to say that it’s not as bad as some people wanted me to believe. It’s different, it breaks the chronological order of tweets, and, yes, maybe it’s been inspired by Facebook, but it feels more lively than the classic timeline of a third-party client. The “clutter” that many dismiss as automatically wrong has actually been full of interesting faves and user accounts that I wouldn’t have discovered hadn’t Twitter decided to show them to me. Twitter’s algorithms are good, and we should be excited about the prospect of a service being able to cater to our interests with timely and accurate recommendations – not cynical by default.\n\nOnce you accept the idea that Twitter timelines may expand beyond your following list and tweets’ timestamps, it’s easy to imagine how they could be remixed to offer more topic suggestions, summaries, or recommendations. But Twitter needs to go easy with that. The idea of a timeline still is a powerful one: Twitter wants to show you what’s happening, and events – no matter the algorithm you use – always happen in succession. Being able to stop and watch events as they unfold *is* what makes Twitter great and essential and unique – whether it’s , the elections, an Apple keynote, or just a regular news day.\n\nTwitter’s biggest challenge with the timeline isn’t appeasing power users – it’s balancing its desire for user attention with the very nature of the service. Twitter doesn’t want to become like Facebook because it would lose the unique advantage that puts them against a confusing and clunky News Feed; but at the same time, a static timeline that doesn’t help people get more out of Twitter isn’t interesting, pushing people to leave Twitter out of boredom.\n\nIt turns out, Twitter struggles with a common dilemma: how to deal with time.\n\n## New Twitter\n\nTwitter and the third-party iOS development community owe a lot to third-party Twitter clients. The modern Twitter mobile experience wouldn’t have been possible without the early efforts of The Iconfactory and Loren Brichter; with Tweetbot, Tapbots has built a Twitter client for power users that can’t be found anywhere else.\n\nBut 2014 Twitter is bigger than Twitterrific and Tweetbot. Today’s Twitter goes beyond text and a traditional display of the timeline – it encompasses native photos (and soon videos), interactive previews, advanced recommendation algorithms, photo tagging features, and a fully indexed search. I didn’t know how much I would come to rely on Twitter’s new features until I started using the official app and now, in spite of design details and advanced functionalities that I still prefer in third-party clients, I don’t feel like I want to switch back.\n\nAnd that’s because the basic Twitter experience in 2014 is different. Twitter is split in Legacy Twitter and Modern Twitter, and it increasingly seems like users and developers of classic clients will have to stay in the past of the service. Perfectly functional (for now), beautiful in their delightful touches, but ultimately limited.\n\nChoosing a Twitter client is incredibly personal. This experiment reinforced my belief that most of my criticism for Tweetbot and Twitterrific stems from API limitations that Twitter won’t fix for third-party developers. For this reason, it would be wrong to judge third-party clients solely based on features they can’t implement. Instead, my exploration allowed me to take a fresh look at the design choices in Twitterrific (generally thoughtful, but sometimes confusing and too skewed towards the idea of a unified timeline) and the functionality of Tweetbot (still great, but sorely missed on the iPad). Twitterrific and Tweetbot aren’t without problems, but they are fantastic apps for what they can do.\n\nReevaluating Twitter clients with no preconceptions made me realize that the official Twitter app is the best choice for me.\n\nTo me, third-party Twitter clients now feel like apps from a different era. Dozens of features that have become part of my daily Twitter experience aren’t supported by Twitterrific and Tweetbot, and there’s nothing they can do about them. At this point, I don’t know what’s right or wrong, and I don’t know if Twitter is making a smart or shortsighted move in not bringing new features to the API. In an ideal world, every developer would always be able to write a client for a web service, but the world is less than ideal, and, unfortunately, sometimes big software companies choose a closed ecosystem.\n\nI started this experiment in June for two reasons: I wanted to assess the state of Twitter clients and I was curious to see if the official Twitter app was as bad as many were saying. In the end, I realized that, as a power user, not only have I been fine with the Twitter app – I miss the new Twitter features when I don’t have them.\n\nI see what Twitter has become, and I like it. The Twitter experience I have in third-party clients isn’t the full Twitter anymore. As much as I wanted to deny it, I needed to face the facts and accept that the rest of the world sees Twitter through a different lens than our iOS community. Twitterrific and Tweetbot still offer plenty of features that I *love* such as timeline sync, better support for external image URLs, and share sheets, but, when compared to the new Twitter that I can have in the official app, the trade-off isn’t worth it anymore for me.\n\nOne day, third-party Twitter clients will likely stop working, and I hope that day will be as far in the future as possible. Twitter was built on third-party apps, and, even if it seems improbable, I’m still hoping that Twitter will find ways to modernize its API because a diversity of clients can only benefit iOS users.\n\nToday, the real Twitter is what you get in their iOS app. And it’s not so bad after all.\n\n> Guys.

[Twitterrific](http:\/\/twitterrific.com\/ios), iOS’ other popular third-party Twitter client by The Iconfactory, hasn’t been updated with support for quoted tweets yet, but, considering the addition in Tweetbot, I hope it’ll follow soon with its own take on the functionality.\n\n[Tweetbot Adds Support for New Twitter ‘Quote’ Feature](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/tweetbot-adds-support-for-new-twitter-quote-feature\/)\n\n# Why I Switched My Favorite Twitter, RSS, and Podcast Apps for Three Weeks\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&header.jpg)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&_header.jpg)\nFor at least five years there have been three slots on my iPhone Home screen dedicated to apps for Twitter, RSS, and podcasts. For as long as I can remember, they have been taken up by [Tweetbot](https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter.-elegant\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), [Reeder](https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/reeder-2\/id697846300?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) and [Castro](https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/castro-podcast-app\/id723142770?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline). Three weeks ago I got rid of all three, and replaced them with [Twitteriffic](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/au\/app\/twitterrific-5-for-twitter\/id580311103?mt=8&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_weekly), [Unread](https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/unread-rss-news-reader\/id911364254?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), and [Pocket Casts](https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/pocket-casts\/id414834813?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline). I had come to the awkward realisation that although I frequently tried new apps (and occasionally reviewed them), I didn’t do the same thing when it came to Twitter, RSS, and podcast apps – at all. I had become too comfortable with the same apps.\n\nSo for three weeks I’ve been solely using those apps, and this “experiment” has lead to a few interesting revelations to me. Perhaps the most obvious one was that I discovered certain features I really liked, but had no idea I liked, until they were missing in the app I switched to (and vice versa). I won’t spoil the results, but suffice to say I have resolved to try new apps (whatever their purpose) more frequently, even if I’m really happy with the app I’m currently using.\n\n**Note:** Just a heads up, this is not a review of Twitteriffic, Unread, and Pocket Casts. It is a reflection of what I *personally* liked and disliked about each of these apps, as compared to my use of Tweetbot, Reeder, and Castro. Just because I preferred one to the other, doesn’t mean they’re bad apps – in fact all six of them are great. Finally, there are some big features of each app that I will not mention, simply because I don’t use them.\n\n## Twitter: Twitteriffic\n\nIf there was anything that really precipitated this experiment, it was the shameful fact that I had not used Twitteriffic for many, many years. The main reason I didn’t choose the official Twitter app for this experiment was that I do actually use it a few times a week to view the Notifications tab, which provides much more info than Tweetbot. But I knew I wouldn’t permanently switch to the Twitter app because I’ve explored it a bit in the past and it just wouldn’t suit my use of Twitter, and I’m happy to use it as an occasional supplement to Tweetbot.\n\nAnyway, three weeks ago I bought the latest version of Twitteriffic and removed Tweetbot from my iPhone home screen. The result…\n\n**I’m switching back to Tweetbot**\n\n### What I Liked About Twitteriffic\n\n**Nothing (but that sounds worse than it is).** What I mean by that is that there aren’t any features or design choices in Twitteriffic that I prefer, compared to Tweetbot. I seriously thought a lot about this, but I just cannot think of anything. Having said all that, and this may sound odd, the choice between Tweetbot and Twitteriffic was actually the closest of all three. Both are incredibly polished apps with a great amount of functionality and design excellence. There was nothing functionally wrong with Twitteriffic, and if Tweetbot disappeared tomorrow, I’d be perfectly happy with being “forced” to use Twitteriffic.\n\n### What I Disliked About Twitteriffic\n\n**Muting Functionality.** I frequently mute hashtags which talk about TV shows because I live in Australia and have to wait hours, if not days\/weeks before I see an episode. But I mute for a period of time, not indefinitely. Tweetbot makes this easy to do: simply tap and hold on a hastag, select “Mute”, and then choose for how long (1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month or Forever). In Twitteriffic you don’t get to choose the period – it’s for an indefinite period. And as someone used to interacting with hashtags, it took me a long time to realise that to mute from a tweet, you need to press the “…” button.\n\n**Top-Heavy User Interface.** I don’t know how people with an iPhone 6 Plus use Twitteriffic – it was difficult enough for me on an iPhone 5s to reach the top navigation buttons. The saving grace is that most of your time will be spent scrolling the main timeline, but if you do need to send a tweet, or view your DMs, get ready to stretch those fingers\/thumbs. I’m also not much of a fan of the sidebar, which I accidentally triggered at least once a day whilst scrolling my timeline.\n\n**Missing Revamped Quote Tweet Functionality.** Just before I started this experiment, Twitter revamped their quote tweet feature and Tweetbot was pretty quick at supporting it on their iPhone app. Three weeks later and my Twitter timeline is full of people using this new quote tweet feature. You can still read the quoted tweet in Twitteriffic by tapping the link, but it takes time and even though I had just a few days of the Tweetbot update, I quickly appreciated it enough to miss it in Twitteriffic. I’m sure this will come to Twitteriffic soon, so I didn’t mark Twitteriffic down too much for missing this, but it was still frustrating.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Twitter.jpg)\n**Miscellaneous Nitpicking.** I had a few occasions (enough to warrant this comment) throughout the three weeks where Twitteriffic would just freeze up and become unresponsive. I think a few of those times where when I had 900+ unread tweets from overnight and I tapped the status bar (to scroll to the top), but then quickly stopped it scrolling, so that it stopped around ~200 unread tweets. It couldn’t seem to handle this a few times and, after a brief lag, completely ignored my intervention and went to the very top. Finally, the unified timeline was just confusing to me, particularly in respect to DMs – fortunately there’s an option to turn this off.\n\n## Podcasts: Pocket Casts\n\nTo preempt the inevitable question as to why I didn’t choose Overcast, Apple’s Podcast app, Instacast, or one of the *many* other clients, it was twofold. I wanted to choose an app I had never tried before, and wanted one that was well-regarded but also an underdog in some respects. Plus Shifty Jelly, the developer of Pocket Casts, also makes [Pocket Weather Australia](https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/pocket-weather-australia\/id546266910?mt=8&amp;uo=6&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), which I really like. The result…\n\n**I’m switching back to Castro**\n\n### What I Liked About Pocket Casts\n\n**Sharing.** I don’t imagine I’d use this feature frequently (I used it once in the three weeks), but the ability to easily share a link to a podcast episode is just great to have – a glaring omission in Castro.\n\n**The Now Playing Screen.** Castro’s innovative scrubber is great, but there’s something equally great about Pocket Cast’s simple but really well designed Now Playing screen. Coming from Castro, it is particularly great to have a large play\/pause button!\n\n**Emoji Notifications.** When I first got a Pocket Casts notification, I wasn’t very impressed with the inclusion of emoji. But as I got a few more notifications about new podcast episodes, I suddenly noticed that they were different emoji – Shifty Jelly has assigned custom emoji for many of the most popular podcasts (e.g. 🇺🇸 This American Life, 💰 Planet Money, 🍊 Freakonomics). It’s a little touch and I actually really like it – although I can imagine opinion might be divided on this issue.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Virtual.jpg)\n**Navigational Structure.** Coming from the simplicity of Castro, Pocket Cast’s navigational structure seemed overly complex to me. There were different “episode filters” for Unplayed, Downloaded, and Downloading – despite the fact that you could tell if an episode was downloaded\/downloading in the unplayed filter (I ended up deleting the others). You could also create your own episode filters, which at first seemed like a great idea. So I created some episode filters but then never found the need to use them. There’s no doubt some people will love the flexibility of Pocket Casts, but I personally prefer the one list approach of Castro. And I subscribe to around 30 podcasts, so I’d say that I’m more than just a casual podcast listener.\n\n**Lack of Description Snippet.** Pocket Casts will only show a single line of the title and doesn’t show any of the description in the episode filter lists. This can be frustrating when I’m trying to choose which episode to watch, as I don’t have a lot of information to go on at a glance. Castro, by contrast, tries to display the entire title (two lines) and includes up to four lines of description – making it a lot easier to skim my list of unplayed episodes and choose which one to watch.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Podcast.jpg)\n**Sleep Timer Functionality.** When you set a sleep timer in Pocket Casts and the timer runs out, the podcast will simply stop playing as if you pressed the pause button. That can confuse me, wondering if I have accidentally pressed the pause button or if there was a problem with the podcast file. By contrast, when the sleep timer in Castro runs out it will fade the volume down to indicate that it is being paused due to the timer. Castro also literally tells you “Sleep timer extended” (via text to voice) when you resume playing the episode. That’s great because in my sleepy state I like the reassurance that the episode won’t continue playing forever if I do fall asleep.\n\n**User Triggered Autoplay.** When you select a podcast episode to play in Pocket Casts it will play that episode and then stop. But if you tap and hold on a podcast episode you can choose to play that “Up Next” or make Pocket Casts autoplay episodes from there. That’s what I want, but I’d rather not have to manually do that every time. Once again, I prefer the way it works in Castro – always playing the next podcast episode available (which can be turned off).\n\n## RSS: Unread\n\nI’ve just talked quite a bit about how much I like using Castro, an app made by Supertop. So when it came to choosing an RSS app to replace Reeder, Unread was an easy choice because it is also made by Supertop, and I’ve heard lots of great things about it. For those reasons, when I went into this experiment I thought that this would be the most likely switch to become permanent. I’ve used Reeder for many, many years and although it is a fantastic app, I presumed I’d enjoy a nice change of pace. The result…\n\n**I’m switching back to Reeder**\n\nTurns out I was pretty wrong. Unread was still a great app, but out of the three switches I made in this experiment, this was the hardest to adjust to.\n\n### What I Liked About Unread\n\n**Themes.** Reeder also has themes, but I much preferred the selection of themes in Unread. Unlike the muted and beige-y themes of Reeder, there are a mix of themes in Unread, some of which incorporate vibrant colors.\n\n**Twitter Timeline Feel.** This was a double-edged sword. Unread will display the first sentence of articles, which when combined with the title, makes it easy to get a good idea of what is in an article. Reeder on the other hand only displays one line of the actual article, which on my iPhone 5s translates to about 4 or 5 words, which is almost always useless. So the upside of Unread’s design was that I found myself tapping in to view the entire article less frequently, and when I did tap into an article it was because I was interested in the full story, not because I wasn’t sure what it was about.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&RSS.jpg)\n**So. Much. Scrolling.** The downside to Unread’s design is that the way I read (mostly scrolling headlines) is made much more laborious. On my iPhone 5s, Unread usually only displays two articles in the list, whereas Reeder’s equivalent screen fits 4-5 articles plus UI elements on the top and bottom of the screen. If I didn’t use RSS as heavily as I do, I think I would actually prefer the information density of Unread. But because of the way I use RSS, Unread made reading it all feel like more work than it does in Reeder.\n\n**Sparse Interface.** This is a little hypocritical of me, given I applauded Castro’s simple interface over Pocket Casts. But I’m going to try and justify myself by noting that I spend a lot of time *using* an RSS reader, whilst my objective with a podcast app is to quickly start a podcast and then exit the app. In any case, I found myself frequently overwhelmed and disorientated by Unread, which is hard to explain. I think it was caused by the really sparse UI with lots of white space and a lack of unique characteristics to individual articles (like publisher icons), but I’m not sure. All I know is that I didn’t enjoy using the app extensively and subconsciously over the three weeks I just started just scrolling through my shorter Smart Streams and delayed going through the larger Smart Streams until I was at my Mac (with Reeder).\n\n## So, Nothing Changed?\n\nYes and no. I have now switched back to my long-standing favorites of Tweetbot, Reeder, and Castro. But I don’t regret starting the experiment and encourage you to take the time and switch some of your longtime favorite apps. I feel more confident that I really am using the best Twitter client *for me*, I’ve discovered some features that I really appreciate (without previously knowing), and I’ve sent a few dollars to great indie developers. This certainly won’t be the last time I run an experiment like this.\n\n[Why I Switched My Favorite Twitter, RSS, and Podcast Apps for Three Weeks](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/why-i-switched-my-favorite-twitter-rss-and-podcast-apps-for-three-weeks\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 4 Review: Bigger Bot\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-005058.jpeg)\nThere have only been two great Twitter apps *for iPad* since 2010: [Loren Brichter’s Twitter](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twitter-for-ipad-review\/), and the [original Tweetbot for iPad](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/).\n\nAs I reminisced last year in [my look at the state of Twitter clients](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/), iOS apps for Twitter are no longer the welcoming, [crowded design playground](http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2009\/04\/twitter_clients_playground) they once were. Developing a Twitter client used to be an exercise in taste and restraint – a test for designers and developers who sought to combine the complex networking of Twitter with a minimalist, nimble approach best suited for a smartphone. Twitter reclaimed their keys to the playground when they [began offering “guidance” on the “best opportunities”](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/) available to third-party developers. Four years into that shift, no major change appears to be in sight.\n\nFor this reason, I’d argue that while the iPhone witnessed the rise of dozens of great Twitter clients in their heyday, the iPad’s 2010 debut played against its chances to receive an equal number of Twitter apps **specifically and tastefully** designed for the device. Less than a year after the original iPad’s launch (and the [Tweetie acquisition](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2010\/twitter-iphone-0) ), Twitter advised developers to stop building clients that replicated the core Twitter experience; a year later, they started [enforcing the 100,000-token limit](http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2012\/11\/16\/twitter-being-a-dick-again) that drove some developers out of business. Not exactly the best conditions to create a Twitter client for a brand new platform.\n\nLargely because of the economic realities of Twitter clients, few developers ever invested in a Twitter app for iPad that wasn’t a cost-effective adaptation of its iPhone counterpart. Many took the easy route, scaling up their iPhone interfaces to fit a larger screen with no meaningful alteration to take advantage of new possibilities. Functionally, that was mostly okay, and to this day some *very good* [Twitter apps](http:\/\/twitterrific.com\/ios) for iPad still resemble their iPhone versions. And yet, I’ve always felt like most companies had ever nailed Twitter clients for a 10-inch multitouch display.\n\nWith two exceptions. The original Twitter for iPad, developed by Tweetie creator and [pull-to-refresh inventor Loren Brichter](http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2013\/5\/21\/4350826\/twitter-pull-to-refresh-patent-innovators-patent-agreement-announced), showed a company at the top of their iOS game, with a unique reinterpretation of Twitter for the iPad’s canvas. The app employed swipes and taps for material interactions that treated the timeline as a stack of cards, with panels you could open and move around to peek at different sets of information. I was in love with the app, and I still think it goes down in software history as one of the finest examples of iPad app design. Until Twitter [ruined it and sucked all the genius out of it](http:\/\/nathanbarry.com\/new-twitter-for-ipad\/), the original Twitter for iPad was a *true* iPad app.\n\nAnd then came Tweetbot. While Twitter stalled innovation in their iPad app, Tapbots doubled down and brought everything that power users appreciated in Tweetbot for iPhone and reimagined it for the iPad. The result was a powerful Twitter client that wasn’t afraid to experiment with the big screen: Tweetbot for iPad featured a flexible sidebar for different orientations, [tabs in profile views](http:\/\/c3419790.r90.cf0.rackcdn.com\/IMG_0484.PNG), popovers, and other thoughtful touches that showed how an iPhone client could be reshaped in the transition to the tablet. Tapbots could have done more, but Tweetbot for iPad raised the bar for Twitter clients for iPad in early 2012.\n\nThree years later, that bar’s still there, a bit dusty and lonely, pondering a sad state of affairs. Tweetbot is no longer the champion of Twitter clients for iPad, having skipped an entire generation of iOS design and new Twitter features. Tweetbot for iPad is, effectively, two years behind other apps on iOS, which, due to how things turned out at Twitter, haven’t been able to do much anyway. On the other hand, Twitter for iPad – long ignored by the company – has emerged again [with a stretched-up iPhone layout](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app\/) presented in the name of “consistency”. It’s a grim landscape, devoid of the excitement and curiosity that surrounded Twitter clients five years ago.\n\nTweetbot 4 wants to bring that excitement back. Long overdue and [launching today on the App Store at $4.99](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) (regular price will be $9.99), Tweetbot 4 is a Universal app that builds upon [the foundation of Tweetbot 3 for iPhone](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/) with several refinements and welcome additions.\n\nIn the process, Tweetbot 4 offers a dramatic overhaul of the iPad app, bringing a new vision for a Twitter client that’s unlike anything I’ve tried on the iPad before.\n\n## Tweetbot for iPad\n\nThe tension of the iPad graduating from single-purpose utility to portable computer is [stronger than ever in iOS 9](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-9-review\/). Tweetbot 4 fits right into this discussion with a redesigned app that leverages the bigger screen to see more at once and interact with multiple pieces of the Twitter timeline at the same time.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-024742.jpeg)\nThe most notable change in Tweetbot 4 for iPad is a new column view that puts a second column on the right side of the screen in landscape mode. Based on Tapbots’ previous work on OS X, the second column allows you to pin views, lists, and searches for the current account to the right. The column is fully interactive and it lets you move across different sections at any time with one tap.\n\nColumn view is enabled by default in landscape mode (it can’t be turned off), and it’s automatically hidden in portrait. Visually, the app borrows from Tweetbot 3, the old Tweetbot for iPad, and Tweetbot for Mac to provide a mix of an iPhone-like interface with a fixed sidebar on the left to move between sections of your account (like Tweetbot 2 for iPad) that, however, only shows icons instead of larger tabs with labels (like Tweetbot for Mac).\n\nFrom a visual standpoint, Tweetbot for iPad is in line with Tapbots’ redesign of Tweetbot 3 for iOS 7, with light and dark themes that have been refined for iOS 9 and the same set of basic interactions for tweets in the timeline. Like on the iPhone, you can tap tweets to reveal an action drawer; tweets, links, user avatars, and other elements can be long-pressed to open the share sheet or more contextual options. The basics of the app are unchanged from Tweetbot 3, and there are no new settings to learn.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-025137.jpeg)\nSwitching sections in column view. \n\nTo change the section shown in the column view in landscape, you can tap the button in the view’s title bar. When scrolling the column, you’ll be able to tap above the button in the title bar to go back to the top; this can be hard to do if you don’t tap *precisely* over the button.\n\nTweetbot’s new column view feels like Split View for Tweetbot itself, limited to a subset of sections. Like Apple’s take on iPad multitasking, the main view and column view are independent from each other in terms of interaction: you can swipe both simultaneously, and scrolling will remain smooth and locked at 60 FPS in both views on the iPad Air 2. From a technical perspective, [Paul Haddad](https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/tapbot_paul) ’s work on the column view results in good performance and no hiccups.\n\nDesign-wise, the column view has posed an interesting conundrum for [Mark Jardine](https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/markjardine), who’s managed to make its look and function fit with the rest of the app – with some reservations.\n\nDue to size constraints, the column view can’t show the action drawer when tapping tweets, and you won’t be able to swipe left to open the detail view for a tweet either. The former is easy to understand: there isn’t enough horizontal space to fit action buttons. I can speculate on the latter, but I believe Tapbots disabled the gesture to avoid potential conflicts with the Slide Over activation gesture, which is also performed in the same direction from the same side of the screen.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-001730.jpeg)\nOpening the detail view only requires one tap. \n\nThus, Tapbots has incorporated the action drawer and swipe left gesture in a single tap that opens a popover for the tweet’s detail view. This way, you can tap on a tweet in the column once to get a popup that packs the tweet, conversation, replies, and actions all together. The same applies to profile pictures, usernames, and hashtags tapped from the column view: they will open as popovers with one tap.\n\nI like the idea of using popovers to avoid having navigation in the narrow column view, and I think it’s a clever way to use the iPad’s screen and to make it easy to get in and out of tweets quickly. I’ve only been confused by having to switch interaction model when moving from the column to the popover: in the column, tweets can’t be swiped to the left, but you’ll have to do that in the popover if you want to open a detail view for a tweet.\n\nInstinctively, I find myself occasionally swiping instead of tapping (and vice versa) when I’m dealing with tweets and popovers from the column view. It’s quite telling that, [like the iPad itself](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-9-review\/15\/#the-visual-complexities-of-ipad-multitasking), Tweetbot is now dealing with increased complexity and cognitive load in its transition from full-screen content to split layouts. I almost wish there was a setting to *always* open detail views with one tap from any timeline.\n\nIt’s also been interesting to observe how Tapbots rebuilt Tweetbot to react to the new multitasking environment of iOS 9. Tweetbot supports Slide Over: this allows you to open the app in a compact layout which is reminiscent of the iPhone version in that it puts tabs at the bottom and you can long-press them to switch views. In Slide Over, Tweetbot is exactly like its iPhone counterpart, with a taller timeline.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-002331.jpeg)\nIn Split View, the app doesn’t show the second column despite the (possible) space of the 75\/25 layout.[1](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-splitcolumn) The app switches from tabs on the left to tabs at the bottom when moving to the 50\/50 Split View layout. Column view is never available when entering Split View with Tweetbot, and I believe this is the right decision for version 1.0 to not make the app too complex.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-001952.jpeg)\nSplit View, 50\/50 layout. \n\nColumn view isn’t perfect. Non-list or search columns are limited to mentions, stats, and activity; I would have also liked to be able to pin favorites and direct messages to the right side of the screen. I fave a lot of tweets on a daily basis, and I’d enjoy the ability to view them while keeping an eye on my streaming timeline on the left. It seems strange to me that Tapbots didn’t consider the use case for DMs as a column next to the timeline.\n\nSecondly – and this could be a deal-breaker for those who like Twitter clients with multiple columns – the column can’t display sections from *other* accounts. You’re limited to views from the currently selected account, which, for some people, could hinder the potential usefulness of column view.\n\nI understand why: because the same views are also available on the left, it would be more useful to load up a section from another account on the right. This way, you could monitor mentions to your blog’s account while you’re using your personal account, for example. There would be another increase in complexity when picking sections from other accounts in the column view, but it seems like the next logical step.\n\nLastly – and I’m mostly nitpicking here – the popover for tweets selected from column view doesn’t always open next to the selected tweet. In most cases, popovers don’t supersede the tweet they’ve been activated from: they’ll be shown on the left side of the tweet, so you’ll retain the context of what’s happening in the popover in relation to the column’s timeline. However, selecting the first or last tweet in column view makes the popover cover the entire column – an issue that should be fixed in a future update.\n\nDespite its limitations and understandable growing pains [2](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-onemore), the sheer utility of column view has deeply changed how I use Twitter on my iPad. I tend to use the iPad in portrait mode constantly, but because I spend a lot of time on Twitter discovering links and talking to readers, column view has made me rethink my usage of the iPad in landscape.\n\nWith Tweetbot 4, I’ve been using my iPad in landscape more frequently, pinning mentions or the activity stream to the right so I can dive into conversations on one side and stay on top of my timeline on the other.\n\nMy favorite use of column view is scrolling mentions in two directions: I can scroll to the bottom and check out old mentions on the right, and stay pinned to the top and keep going with recent replies on the left. This has helped me engage with more readers and be more timely in my response as I can move quickly across different sets of mentions.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-032451.jpeg)\nSlide Over Tweetbot. The perfect way to check on those sweet, sweet faves while you’re supposed to be working. (Thankfully, my boss is a very reasonable guy.) \n\nCombined with Picture in Picture, I’ve been using Tweetbot while reading my timeline, monitoring mentions, and watching videos – a testament to iOS 9’s multitasking prowess but also proof of Tapbots’ apt work. Tweetbot is excellent in Split View: keeping my timeline next to Slack and Safari lets me follow breaking news and team updates, saving me the time I would normally spend switching back and forth between Twitter and other apps.\n\nTweetbot 4 is a must-have for Twitter power users who work from an iPad. The utility of column view is clear: once you see what Tapbots has done with the iPad’s screen, comparing it to Twitter’s [prodigy of wastefulness](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app\/) is not even funny. Column view has redefined my idea of what a Twitter client should be capable of doing on the iPad, and I’m curious to see how it’ll evolve.\n\nSome will ask for a way to turn off column view. Personally, I wish I could use it in portrait mode, too.[3](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-pro)\n\n### iPhone 6 Plus Landscape Mode\n\nColumn view is best experienced on Tweetbot for iPad, but it’s not exclusive to the device. iPhone 6 Plus owners will be able to use column view in landscape mode, which, like on the iPad, puts a second timeline on the right with a popover to switch sections at the top.[4](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-iphone6)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-032047.jpeg)\nTapbots had to accept some trade-offs with column view on the 6 Plus. Screen height is the biggest compromise here, with Tweetbot displaying 2-3 tweets in the column view due to limited vertical space. Popovers have also been replaced by modal popups that take over the app in the middle of the screen: their behavior is the same as on the iPad, but they hide the main view and column underneath.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-031937.jpeg)\nI haven’t used column view on my 6 Plus much for two reasons: when I need to go through lots of links and mentions I just grab my iPad; and, I don’t use landscape mode on the 6 Plus much anyway. But, there have been a couple of occasions in which I couldn’t use my iPad and I had time to browse mentions in column view; in spite of the limited size, I appreciated the ability to pin a second column on the iPhone.\n\nA nice detail that I have to mention: in landscape mode, tabs rotate with the app and are displayed in a sidebar on the left. You can tap & hold them to show the contextual menu for other views, which will animate horizontally instead of vertically.\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nWith iOS 9, Tapbots has added support for external keyboard shortcuts in Tweetbot for iPad. The feature is based on the OS’ improved keyboard integration and Discoverability, which displays available shortcuts based on the view you’re in with a translucent cheat sheet.\n\nThere are two sets of shortcuts in Tweetbot 4. In the main view, you can cycle through sections with Command-1\/9 (like in the Mac app) and open the compose screen with Command-N. When in compose mode, you can send a tweet with Command-Return or dismiss it with Command-ESC.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-033334.jpeg)\nAlas, that’s about it for keyboard shortcuts in Tweetbot. You can’t scroll the timeline without touching the screen, and there’s no concept of tweet selection with associated actions.\n\nIt would have been nice to interact with the app from the keyboard to select tweets and reply or share with shortcuts. I like that I can change sections and send tweets without lifting my fingers off the keyboard, but I wish Tapbots had done a little more in this regard (such as supporting actions and share when in a Detail view).[5](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-shortcutbar)\n\n## Stats and Activity Views\n\nTweetbot 4 offers two new views to keep track of interactions with your tweets. Called Stats and Activity, these views are bundled in the same page and you can switch between them with a segmented control in the title bar.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-033740.jpeg)\nActivity is reminiscent of Twitter’s own Notifications tab: it lists every mention, follow, fave, quote, and retweet you’ve received from newest to oldest, and it updates in real time on Wi-Fi. Each interaction is marked with a different icon in the stream, and tapping an item will take you to the relevant user profile or tweet. If you’re looking for a way to view interactions with your tweets in a unified timeline, the Activity stream is a handy addition, and I was surprised to see that Tapbots was able to aggregate quoted tweets as well.\n\nI’ve been more interested in the Stats screen, though. In this page, you’ll get a weekly chart of your daily activity on Twitter with separate counts for faves, retweets, and new followers for the current day. A big, blue ‘Today’ number shows a count of everything reported in the Activity stream since midnight local time, and tweets that have recently received faves and retweets are displayed at the bottom in a scrollable timeline.\n\nI try not to obsess over Twitter stats and followers, but I enjoy the occasional report on how my tweets are doing and if people are responding well to them. The Stats dashboard doesn’t surface all the data that is available with individual tweet statistics in the Twitter app, but it provides the kind of unified visualization that is missing from the official client and which tracks easy-to-understand metrics such as faves and RTs.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-033948.jpeg)\nThe chart, while unable to display data points for individual days, is a nice way to get a visual breakdown of your activity for the past week. One issue I have with it, though, is that it’s not clear what Today means unless you know that it sums up all items from the Activity stream. Also, I would have expected to be able to tap on the followers count to see everyone who’s started following me, but tapping that number does nothing. Once Tapbots resolves these issues, I wouldn’t mind having access to monthly and yearly stats collected from Tweetbot, too.\n\nThe detail view for tweets listed in the Stats screen is interesting. Tap on one of your tweets, and Tweetbot will show another count for faves and retweets with profile pictures of users who have favorited or retweeted your tweet, plus a list of replies and quotes with tabs at the bottom. I like how information is broken down in this view: retweets and faves are the counts I care about the most, and, thanks to the Twitter API, Tweetbot gives me access to the same counts I see in the official Twitter app with the ability to view all users who have interacted with a tweet.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-034521.jpeg)\nReplies and Quotes are a handy addition, as I can easily separate mentions from quotes and check how people have commented on my tweets without having to search for them. The Twitter app doesn’t have an option for replies and quotes tied to the original tweet; Twitterrific shows counts, but they’re not tappable, and the app doesn’t offer a reply\/quote breakdown either.\n\nAs a result, the Stats page in Tweetbot 4 is my new favorite way to check Twitter statistics that matter to me. Faves and retweets are the universal counts that everyone understands; unlike the clicks and “engagements” reported by the official app, they’re not specific to any client and they’re fairly indicative of a tweet’s popularity.[6](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-dotheyfollowme)\n\nFrom a design standpoint, Tapbots has done a good job at logically grouping stats together with tweets, providing a simple yet effective dashboard that looks great and sums up a week’s activity nicely.[7](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-onething) Despite some minor problems, I’m happy that Tapbots has been able to pull this off with the Twitter API, and I’ve found myself checking out the Stats page on a regular basis.\n\n### Safari View Controller\n\nThis won’t come as a surprise, but Tweetbot 4 adds support for iOS 9’s Safari View Controller to open links inside the app with an in-app browser based on Safari. Safari View Controller can be enabled by going to Settings > Browser and toggling ‘Open in Tweetbot’.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-034759.jpeg)\nSafari View Controller (left) and Tweetbot’s updated share sheet. \n\nI’m a fan of Safari View Controller, and I have enabled it in every app that supports it on iOS 9. The speed and usability advantages of Safari View Controller trump any custom browser I’ve tried, and I value the ability to open webpages with the same set of options (such as Reader and Content Blockers) that I’d normally get in Safari.\n\nThere’s a disclaimer, though. By enabling Safari View Controller in Tweetbot, you lose the ability to open a webpage in one of the app’s tabs and continue browsing Twitter in other tabs. As [I wrote in my review of Tweetbot 3](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/):\n\n> Now, whenever you follow a link, a web view will be opened and confined to the tab it’s been launched from. If you open a link from your timeline, you can switch to the Mentions tab and do something else; if you open a link from a DM, you can go back to the timeline and read tweets while the page is loading.  \n\nDue to Safari View Controller’s modal behavior that takes over in full-screen on any view underneath, this is no longer possible if you set in-app Safari as a browser option. It’s a necessary compromise to enable Safari View Controller integration in Tweetbot, and there’s nothing Tapbots can do about the system API.\n\nI somewhat miss the navigation freedom granted by the old in-app browser, but the convenience of Safari View Controller and its performance gains have led me to use it all the time, opening links in Safari when I don’t want Safari View Controller to disrupt the view I’m looking at.[8](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-backbutton)\n\n## Design Changes\n\niPad app and Stats page aside, there are some visual changes in the new Tweetbot worth noting. For the most part, the app doesn’t drift away from the direction of Tweetbot 3; tweaks to color highlights and other redesigned screens make for a refreshed UI with some practical advantages as well.\n\nFirst up: San Francisco. Available in Settings > Display, Apple’s new system typeface is the default option in Tweetbot 4. Avenir is still available, but I’ve been satisfied with the look and readability of San Francisco.[9](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-frisco)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-09-30-234005.jpeg)\nLeft: Tweetbot 3. \n\nThe tweet selection highlight has been changed from a dark gray to a *very* light gray with a blue action drawer. The entire app has received a new shade of blue (including the icon); it’s a nice visual change as the blue color is used for links, in-app banners, usernames, the new tweet indicator, and more.[10](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-darkblue) ~\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-000423.jpeg)\nOther screens have been redesigned as well. \n\nIn the DM view, tapping the ‘+’ button in the top right no longer prompts you to choose between a new tweet or direct message. Instead, Tweetbot 4 will default to a new DM, bringing up a popover to search among your followers.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-042223.jpeg)\nI’ve long been skeptical about the decision to enable new tweets from the DM screen with a prompt, and I think the new behavior is more limited but also more pragmatic than the old one.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-043156.jpeg)\nLook at this handsome guy. (Right: Tweetbot 4) \n\nUser profiles are perhaps the biggest design change in Tweetbot 4. Following version 2.0 for OS X, profile pictures and bios are now centered on top of a blurred cover photo (you can still swipe down to view it). Followers and Following lists have become tabs below the user bio and above the ‘Tweets’ and ‘Listed’ buttons. Displayed between tabs at the top and Recent Media at the bottom, Recent Tweets show a user’s latest tweets that aren’t replies to someone else. This is a good way to get a quick understanding of what someone tweets about without scrolling all of their tweets and mentions.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-042913.jpeg)\nTapbots must have been thinking about the process of following new users as well: towards the bottom of profiles for users you’re not following, you’ll see a group of Common Followers – users you follow that already follow the user you’re viewing. I’m more likely to follow someone if people I trust are already following that user, and I think this is another minor but handy addition that surfaces interesting data in the app.\n\n### Detail View\n\nTweetbot 4 has a redesigned tweet detail view: fave and RT counts are still available above the tweet’s date and client information, but conversations are arranged to be more in line with the official Twitter app.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-041907.jpeg)\nTweetbot 3’s detail view (left) and Tweetbot 4. \n\nIn the new app, the original tweet a mention is in reply to is displayed above the tweet and hidden by default, so you’ll need to swipe down to view the preceding tweet and conversation. Then, subsequent replies to a tweet are loaded at the bottom of a tweet in reverse chronological order from newest to oldest. This is a departure from Tweetbot’s old reply and conversation UI, and I have to say I’m glad Taptbots borrowed this from Twitter’s more logical thread interface.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-042710.jpeg)\nEven if it breaks the spatiality of the Twitter timeline (where new tweets are always at the top), having past conversations sit on top of the currently viewed tweet makes more sense from a messaging UI perspective. In modern messaging conventions, old conversations are above and new texts come in below them. By swiping up to view the original tweet and conversation, you’re performing the same gesture you’d typically perform in Messages or Slack to view older conversations.\n\nReplies to the tweet in the lower half of the screen, on the other hand, reverse the spatiality of conversations by showing old replies at the bottom and the newest ones at the top (Twitter keeps the opposite order in their app). The thinking here is that, when viewing a tweet, you want to see the latest replies and reactions to it without scrolling to the bottom to see what’s new. While I wasn’t sure about this decision at first, it has grown on me in the past few weeks of using Tweetbot, especially to check replies to my tweets. I prefer to see the latest comments first (because that’s what I might have missed) and older ones further down the list (as I’m more likely to have already seen them).\n\n### New Compose\n\nThe compose window has also been reworked in Tweetbot 4 with a revamped media picker and a UI refresh. It now opens as a pane in front of the timeline on the iPhone and as a floating popup on the iPad.[11](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-expands)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-000816.jpeg)\nThis new design fits with the idea of layers in a post-iOS 7 world, but, surprisingly, it cannot be pulled down with a swipe to be dismissed. \n\nYou can still attach location data, pick usernames, and choose hashtags from this screen, with Tweetbot taking care of highlighting text properly. The big change is the new media picker, which opens as a scrollable tray of recent items from your photo library that you can tap to quickly attach them to a tweet.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-000613.jpeg)\nComposing new tweets on the iPad. \n\nI like the media picker as it’s modeled after the one in Messages in the way it facilitates picking recent items as opposed to manually opening the default photo picker every time. The animation effects used by Tapbots here are neat, with delightful bounces on selected images, a count on top of each item, and a media preview popping up in the compose field as you choose images and videos.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-043807.jpeg)\nYou can throw images away to dismiss them. \n\nAfter attaching items to a tweet and going back to the keyboard (another cool transition), you can tap on the thumbnail previews to bring up a full-screen preview with a ‘Remove’ button at the bottom to discard an item. As with other media previews in the app, you can close the preview by throwing the image away with a swipe. Everything about the media picker in Tweetbot 4 is playful and polished, and it’s one of my favorite details of the app.\n\n## What’s Still Missing\n\nBesides the (many) features that are exclusive to Twitter’s official app and that Tweebot can’t implement [12](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-twitter), there are some things that I wish Tapbots had considered for version 4.0, but which aren’t available today.\n\nTweetbot 4.0 still doesn’t offer a share extension to share text and links from other apps via the share sheet. Apps like [Linky](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/linky-share-webpage-links\/id438090426?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) have shown the benefits of a custom tweet sheet with more advanced options, and it’s too bad that to share content with Tweetbot, you’ll need to do so by opening the app.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-01-044008.jpeg)\nThere isn’t a Watch app yet, and while the obligation to have a Watch counterpart for every iOS app is debatable, I believe that Twitterrific has demonstrated how ample utility can be derived from a subset of tweeting functionalities on the wrist.[13](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-twitterrificwatch) Given Tweetbot 4’s support for actionable notifications [14](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/#fn-40481-notifications) and aggregated stats for tweets and users, it would have been nice to have some of this content and actions available on Apple Watch.\n\nIn terms of customization, Tweetbot for iPad comes with the same light and dark themes of the iPhone version, but personalization of the experience ends there. You can’t customize the left sidebar with icon shortcuts to specific lists or users, which leaves the area mostly empty in portrait mode.\n\nFinally, while it didn’t directly affect me, Tweetbot 4.0 is launching without 3D Touch support on the iPhone 6s. This means that you won’t be able to launch app shortcuts from the Home screen or use peek & pop for links in the app. I hope that Tapbots will release an update to enable the feature in the iPhone app soon.\n\n## Bigger Bot\n\nThere’s a parallel between iOS 9 and Tweetbot 4. Like Apple’s latest iOS, the new Tweetbot brings a series of welcome refinements and smaller feature additions to the iPhone, with a much bigger change on the iPad that redefines the experience on the big screen.\n\nTapbots fundamentally understands the iPad platform better than Twitter does. Through the second column, popovers, and other interface adjustments, Tweetbot 4 makes the best use of the iPad’s screen since the original Twitter for iPad. And while Tapbots’ latest effort doesn’t have the revolutionary spirit of Loren Brichter’s iPad masterpiece, it shows a willingness to do more than simply adapting what worked for the iPhone.\n\nTweebot 4 is a nicer, faster Tweetbot in every way. That doesn’t change the fact, however, that what you’ll see in the app is [a legacy Twitter](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#new-twitter), lacking the modern features and integrations of the official product. To get the full Twitter experience, you’ll need to keep the official app installed.\n\nIn this sense, Tweetbot 4 embraces its limitations and builds upon them, offering the kind of detail and features that Twitter – for different reasons – is ignoring or overcomplicating. Safari View Controller is a good example of what Tapbots has done that [Twitter doesn’t want to do](https:\/\/openradar.appspot.com\/21349835); the Stats screen, with its limited access to the Twitter API, provides a simple way to check on favorites, retweets, and new followers with a pretty chart – precisely what Twitter isn’t interested in doing for their app.\n\nI’m an advocate of the modern Twitter, and I think their iOS app has more interesting options than most people tend to believe. But, thanks to its iPad app designed for power users and multitasking, Tweetbot 4 is [making an offer](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=SeldwfOwuL8) I can’t refuse.\n\nI switched back to Tweetbot weeks ago, and I’ve found it to be the best way to communicate and work with Twitter on my iPad in years. I’m not exaggerating it: if you work with Twitter on a daily basis from the iPad, Tweetbot 4 is the client you’ve been looking for.\n\nI miss many of the features of Twitter’s app, such as fave and RT counts always displayed for every tweet in the timeline, cards, [search](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/you-can-now-search-for-every-tweet-ever-sent-in-the-twitter-app\/), and one-tap access to conversations. But with the new iPad app, timeline sync, and improvements to the iPhone app, I’ve discovered a whole new Tweetbot that makes me more efficient at using Twitter every day.\n\nTweetbot 4 shows what a Twitter client for iPad should be. Three years ago, I [wrote](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/) that Tweetbot for iPad was the better Twitter app I had been waiting for. Today, that is still the case.\n\nFunny how history repeats itself.\n\nTweetbot 4 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 4 Review: Bigger Bot](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 2.1 for Mac\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&256px.png)\nToday, [Tweetbot for Mac has been updated to version 2.1](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), which brings the same Activity page [seen in Tweetbot 4 for iOS](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/), better support for quoted tweets, in-app video playback, and several other improvements. Notably, you can now view images shared in Direct Messages (you’ll still have to share them from the official Twitter app, though), the search popover for users has been simplified, and you can now select and define words in tweet detail views. A good update for Mac users, with some welcome parity with the iOS version.\n\n[Tweetbot 2.1 for Mac](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/tweetbot-2-1-for-mac\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 4 Adds 3D Touch Support on iPhone 6s\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-14-161435.jpeg)\n[Released earlier this month](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/), Tweetbot 4 marked an important comeback for Tapbots. After years of stagnation, the iPad app received a fantastic update with a new design and column view, while the iPhone app continued refining the foundation of Tweetbot 3 with power user features and various visual tweaks.\n\nAmong changes, however, Tweetbot 4 didn’t launch with 3D Touch integration on the iPhone 6s – a choice motivated by developed Paul Haddad with an understandable desire to test the new input method on an actual device first. Today, [Tapbots has released Tweetbot 4.0.1](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), which brings support for 3D Touch in the form of Home screen shortcuts and peek & pop gestures inside the app.\n\nI wouldn’t normally cover every single app which received 3D Touch support over the past few weeks, but my usage of Tweetbot 4 is high and frequent enough to warrant a standalone mention. Also, I believe the implementation in the app’s timeline considerably changes the experience of browsing and previewing tweets.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-14-161557.jpeg)\nOn the Home screen, Tweetbot shows three shortcuts upon pressing firmly on its icon: Show Activity, Tweet Last Photo, and Tweet. The ability to quickly tweet the last photo taken has been particularly handy in my tests. I often take a screenshot on my iPhone that I want to share on Twitter; with 3D Touch and this shortcut, Tweetbot opens in the Compose screen, populating its attachment field with the last item from your photo library. It’s an ingenious addition to the 3D Touch menu, and one that shows how hidden app features [can be exposed to users in a fresh and consistent way](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/a-level-deeper\/).\n\nAlas, Tweetbot currently doesn’t let you customize the menu like [Launch Center Pro](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/launch-center-pro-shortcut\/id532016360?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) or [PCalc](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/pcalc-the-best-calculator\/id284666222?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) can – if you were hoping to have easy access to Direct Messages or a list in here, you’re out of luck this time. I hope that Tapbots will consider allowing users to define their own 3D Touch options for the Home screen (it seems like many developers are [opting for this route](https:\/\/twitter.com\/bthdonohue\/status\/654000844371820544) ).\n\nWhere 3D Touch in Tweetbot is most impressive, I think, is in the peek & pop gestures. In any timeline in the app (read: not in a tweet detail view, direct message, or profile view), you’ll be able to press once to peek at a tweet, webpage, or user profile, then press harder to pop it open and navigate to a detail view, full profile, or webpage with Safari View Controller. These gestures are accompanied by the same visual effects and haptic feedback used elsewhere in iOS 9; you can also swipe up when peeking at content to reveal an action menu with contextual options for tweets (fave, retweet, quote, or reply) and users (reply, manage list memberships, or mute).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-14-161706.jpeg)\nSince getting a version of Tweetbot with 3D Touch support last week, I’ve started readjusting the way I interact with my timeline on a daily basis. When I scroll my Twitter feed, I don’t need to look at every tweet in detail. Over the years (and by following quite a few people), I’ve developed a way to quickly assess a tweet’s relevance to my interests. A good part of my Twitter experience is previewing content – whether it’s a tweet, an article, or a user profile – before deciding what to do with it: should I read this now or save it for later? Is this tweet worth a favorite? What about this picture?\n\n3D Touch facilitates this behavior as quickly previewing tweets and links is easier than ever. If I want to see how many faves, retweets, or replies a tweet has received I no longer have to swipe on it and then swipe back – I can just press, peek, and let go to return to my timeline. Tweets are previewed in a smaller card with the same design of a standalone detail view (which is what you get if you “pop” and choose to fully expand a tweet, entering a nested view).\n\nAs per Tapbots’ tradition, the implementation is extremely well done and fast: when peeking, the original tweet and replies load above and below the tweet you 3D-touched, which lets you peek at entire conversations with just a press of your finger on the timeline. You can also peek at Vines, Twitter videos, and Instagram videos, which will start playing in the preview card without having to press harder to pop them. You can peek at embedded tweets, hashtags, and profiles – which will show a small card with essential user information such as bio and followers counts.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-14-161752.jpeg)\nThese new interactions don’t just make for a good demo of 3D Touch – when applied to the Twitter timeline, they fundamentally alter the experience of previewing tweets and media. The nimble flow of peek and pop plays well with the ephemeral and short-form nature of Twitter – it’s a perfect match, and Tapbots is taking advantage of it quite cleverly.\n\nThat’s not to say Tapbots can’t do better in future iterations of 3D Touch in Tweetbot. When peeking at a tweet that contains a picture\/video, the thumbnail preview isn’t shown in the floating card – a design choice that I don’t fully understand as it’d be useful to see the full tweet alongside fave and RT counts when peeking.\n\nBecause it’s limited to timeline views, I’ve often been confused by the inability of 3D-touching in the DM screen and tweet detail views, which was registered as a long tap that brought up the share sheet. Speaking of which, it can be occasionally difficult to not trigger the share sheet instead of the peek preview (and vice versa), but I don’t know if this is simply something I’ll get used to with time. In general, I’d like to see more consistency with the availability of 3D Touch in the app.\n\nI didn’t think 3D Touch would turn out to be a big deal for Tweetbot, but in my usage it has become a key aspect of interacting with the app and saving time when looking at tweets, users, and webpages. Tapbots has done a good job at understanding how 3D Touch could be useful in the app, and I’m looking forward to more customization and consistency in the future.\n\nTweetbot 4.0.1 with 3D Touch support is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 4 Adds 3D Touch Support on iPhone 6s](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/tweetbot-4-adds-3d-touch-support-on-iphone-6s\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 4.0.2 Lets You Swipe Safari View Controller Away\n\nWell, that was fast.\n\nA few hours after [the release of Tweetbot 4.0.1 with 3D Touch](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/tweetbot-4-adds-3d-touch-support-on-iphone-6s\/), Tapbots has released [version 4.0.2 of the app](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), which adds a swipeable Safari View Controller.\n\nThanks to a workaround by Paul Haddad, you can now dismiss Safari View Controller with swipe from anywhere along the left edge of the screen – on both the iPhone and iPad. The gesture works surprisingly well despite its non-standard behavior, and it fixes [one major annoyance of Safari View Controller](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/fixing-safari-view-controller\/) on iOS 9.\n\nI hope that more apps consider this, as it combines the comfort of Tweetbot’s old web view with the benefits of Safari View Controller.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2015-10-14-210048.jpeg)\n**Update**: Also in this release, you can set Safari View Controller to open in Safari Reader mode automatically for every webpage (if Reader is available). I previously wrote about the feature [here](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/safari-view-controller-and-automatic-safari-reader-activation\/), and it works well for Tweetbot if you primarily open articles to read in-app. Very nice.\n\n[Tweetbot 4.0.2 Lets You Swipe Safari View Controller Away](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/tweetbot-4-0-2-lets-you-swipe-safari-view-controller-away\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Upgrades to CloudKit Sync\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&256px.png)\nThe latest version of Tweetbot for iOS has upgraded its iCloud syncing engine to [CloudKit](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/icloud\/), bringing faster performance for timeline, DM, and mute filter sync. From the release notes:\n\n> This update is all about sync. We’ve switched our syncing engine to use CloudKit which will provide you with faster, more consistent syncing between your iOS devices and Macs. It also sets up a foundation for some cool features we have planned for future releases. We know improved syncing doesn’t sound too exciting, but it will provide a better underlying experience.  \n\nFrom a user’s perspective, nothing’s changed – Tweetbot still uses iCloud and you don’t have to change anything in your preferences. However, Tweetbot is now using a *better* version of iCloud, with near-instant sync of changes between devices.\n\nI’ve been running this version of Tweetbot with CloudKit sync for a few weeks, and it’s a very nice upgrade from the old iCloud sync. I’ve often left two devices running with Tweetbot in the foreground at the same time, and I’ve seen the timeline scroll on one device just a second after I stopped scrolling on the primary device. It’s impressive.\n\nIf you haven’t tried iCloud sync in Tweetbot in a while, go check it out again. Tweetbot 4.3 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/geo.itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) (my review of Tweetbot 4.0 is [here](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/) ).\n\n[Tweetbot Upgrades to CloudKit Sync](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/tweetbot-upgrades-to-cloudkit-sync\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 4.3 Introduces ‘Topics’ for Easier Tweetstorm Creation\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-05-06-045825.jpeg)\nA topic in the new Tweetbot 4.3. \n\nPicture this: it’s WWDC keynote day and you’re following the event. You want to live tweet as the event unfolds. What do you do?\n\nThe answer is that, so far, Twitter *the company* has mostly failed to provide users with ways to rapidly tweet commentary and have tweets intelligently grouped together once an event is over. Sure, you could append the same hashtag to every tweet, “tagging it” for context, but that wouldn’t fix the underlying problem of a bunch of messages related to the same event and yet treated as atomic units with no relationship between them.\n\nThus Twitter *the community* came up with the idea of the [tweetstorm](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/#tweetstorms), a clever workaround based on how Twitter threads work. If you want to post multiple tweets in a row and establish a thread between them from start to finish, reply to your own tweet, removing your username at the beginning of the message, and you’ll “fake” a series of topical tweets which Twitter sees as part of a conversation…with *yourself*. It’s not the most elegant solution, and it doesn’t work well for rapid fire live tweeting, but it *sort of* works and a lot of people use it by now.\n\nTweetbot, the excellent Twitter client developed by Tapbots which [relaunched with version 4.0 in October](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/), is [introducing an update today](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) that fully embraces the concept of tweetstorms with a feature called “topics”.\n\nTopics simplify the process of chaining tweets together with an intuitive interface that makes it look like Twitter rolled out support for topics. Under the hood, Tapbots is still leveraging the aforementioned @reply workaround, but they’ve been clever enough to completely abstract that from the UI, building what is, quite possibly, one of the most ingenious Tweetbot features to date.\n\n## Topics and Tweetstorms\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-05-06-045305.jpeg)\nSetting up a topic. \n\nTopics in Tweetbot 4.3 use chained replies as the backbone for a cleaner presentation of multiple tweets about a subject. They’re easier to create than normal tweetstorms and they are ideal for live tweeting as well as thoughts spanning multiple tweets. You can include hashtags with every tweet when a topic is assigned, and you can also automatically save a group of tweets as a [Twitter Collection](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/rest\/collections), which you can later share and publish elsewhere.\n\nTopics can be activated in two ways. When you hit the Reply button on a tweet of yours, you’re shown a menu to send a reply or create a new topic. The ‘Create Topic’ screen requires you to add a title (which only you can see) and it has two optional fields for hashtags and Collections. If you choose to mirror tweets from a topic into a collection, you can enter a description for the collection, too. Alternatively, you can create and assign topics by tapping the gear icon in the Compose screen of a new tweet (where Drafts are also located).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-05-06-045857.jpeg)\nOnce you have some topics (they are stored on a per-account basis), you can pick one and it’ll be assigned to the tweet you’re composing. Tweetbot nicely indicates you’re tweeting in topic mode with a blue bar on top of the compose screen. If you tap the ‘x’ button, you’ll remove the topic from the tweet and your message won’t be chained to anything you’ve previously tweeted.\n\nHere’s how Tapbots turned a hacky workaround into an elegant option: you don’t have to actually reply to yourself, remove your username, or chain tweets every time. You can just tweet by opening the compose screen and assigning a topic. Under the hood, Tweetbot will find existing tweets belonging to a topic, it’ll fetch the latest tweet from that group, and it’ll send the new tweet as a reply to it. It even takes care of automatically stripping your username at the beginning of the tweet. Everything happens behind the scenes. You don’t have to manage any of it, and you’ll end up with a series of threaded tweets that’s really a string of messages in reply to each other. It’s much simpler and faster than creating a tweetstorm by replying to yourself. It feels like a native Twitter feature.\n\nIt gets better if you decide to publish a topic as a collection. Until today, Tweetbot had no way to display Twitter Collections, let alone create new ones. Twitter itself doesn’t support adding tweets to collections on its iOS app – you’ll have to use Tweetdeck. With Tweetbot 4.3, Tapbots added support for the [Collection API](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/rest\/reference\/post\/collections\/entries\/curate) to add tweets from a topic into a collection. Ironically, Tweetbot has a better chance at making collections more widely used than Twitter’s own iOS apps.\n\nWhen you mirror a topic to a collection, every tweet will be neatly grouped in it; you can find collections under your profile.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-05-06-125134.jpeg)\nTweets inside collections are sorted from oldest to newest. You can share a link to a collection or email every tweet from a collection to someone else. If you head over to Twitter.com on a desktop web browser, you can also generate embed codes for collections so you can publish them on the web. Take a look at the topic I created last night with Tweetbot 4.3 about gadgets I like, saved as a collection.\n\n[New Gadgets I Like](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/timelines\/728340392937197569)\nThe downside of automatic addition to collections is that you won’t be able to turn it off for individual tweets. Either you add every tweet from a topic to a collection or you don’t add them at all. This is something I’d like to see Tapbots improve in the future.\n\nBecause topics are stored in iCloud, you’ll be able to create a topic on your iPhone, then pick up the iPad and Tweetbot will reply to the latest tweet from a synced topic. This worked well in my tests, though Tweetbot for Mac still hasn’t received support for topics and I wasn’t able to test the feature on my MacBook Air. Tapbots says topic support in Tweetbot for Mac is coming soon.\n\nTweetbot’s new topic feature is a good example of why we need third-party Twitter clients. Despite the rising popularity of tweetstorms and the idea of posting multiple tweets as part of a longer event or discussion, Twitter has refused to build official support for topics. As a result, users have come up with their own workaround, which isn’t ideal but gets the job done. The folks at Tapbots have disassembled the workaround, made it work seamlessly behind the scenes, and they’ve repackaged it with a nice interface, sync between devices, compatibility with Twitter’s apps, and the delightful touch of Twitter Collections.\n\nOnce again, Tapbots has devised a solution to make Twitter power users save time and have a superior experience than the official Twitter app. I expect to use Tweetbot’s topics profusely going forward.\n\n## iPad Improvements\n\nTweetbot 4.3 comes with two nice improvements on the iPad.\n\nFirst, support for hardware keyboards has been expanded and you can now navigate tweets in the timeline with the arrow keys. This, plus the ability to interact with selected tweets through shortcuts, makes the external keyboard experience in Tweetbot fairly solid.\n\nSecond, Tweetbot 4.3 adds a button to hide and show the secondary column whenever you want. Users who prefer to hide the column will be able to do so with the new button in the top toolbar, but, more importantly for me, this means I can view the column while Tweetbot is in Split View as well.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-05-06-045508.jpeg)\nMultitasking inception. \n\nThis alone has changed how I use Tweetbot on my iPad Pro. Every day, I take a few minutes to go through my mentions and reply to as many as I can. When I’m doing that, I like to keep an eye on my main timeline as well – which was already possible in Tweetbot 4.0. However, until today, Tweetbot wouldn’t show the second column in Split View even though there was clearly enough space for it.\n\nWith Tweetbot 4.3, I can scroll my mentions, check on my timeline, and use *another* app at the same time. It’s like I’m doing three things at once, and I can’t help but wonder about a future version of iOS where you can look at three or four apps simultaneously. I don’t think it’d be too crazy at this point.\n\n## More Tweetstorms Are Coming\n\nSeven months [later](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/), Tweetbot 4 continues to be everything Twitter for iOS isn’t: a powerful iOS app with an iPad version that truly takes advantage of the bigger display.\n\nYou could argue that Twitter’s iOS team doesn’t care about the power user features that Tapbots builds because they’re catering to a different audience. But there’s a bigger problem going on. Twitter is simply making a bad iPad app, with a poor timeline design, lackluster system integrations, and a [ridiculous iPad Pro UI](https:\/\/2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/2016-05-06-043205.jpeg). Twitter for iPad should be a case study on how you shouldn’t design an iPad app – they’re shipping the stuff Tim Cook [once ridiculed](http:\/\/marketingland.com\/apple-twitter-poster-child-android-failure-7485). Twitter used to be [at the forefront of iPad interface design](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twitter-for-ipad-review\/). It’s sad to see where they’ve ended up.\n\nTweetbot 4 is the best client for Twitter power users on iOS but it’s also the best Twitter app on the iPad, period. Today’s update epitomizes what Tapbots excels at: it offers an intelligent solution for a feature Twitter has avoided to build, and it takes the iPad app to the next level for multitasking with Split View and external keyboard improvements. I expect to see a lot of topic-based tweets in my timeline [next month](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/wwdc\/).\n\nTweetbot 4.3 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 4.3 Introduces ‘Topics’ for Easier Tweetstorm Creation](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-3-introduces-topics-for-easier-tweetstorm-creation\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 4.4 Brings Timeline Filters\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-06-23-000645.jpeg)\nWith [an update launching today](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) on the App Store, Tweetbot is adding the ability to filter timelines – any timeline within the app – by specific types of content.\n\nI didn’t fully grasp the benefit of filters at first – they looked like another way to enable mute filters in any Tweetbot view. After spending a week with filters, though, I can see the value they bring to the app, particularly if you use searches and profile timelines a lot, or if you’ve been looking for ways to quickly exclude or catch up on a topic in your timeline.\n\nTweetbot’s new timeline filters can dynamically filter tweets based on keywords and the following tweet types:\n\n* Media\n* Links\n* Mentions\n* Hashtags\n* Quotes\n* Retweets\n* Replies\n* People you follow\n\nUnlike mute filters (which, once activated, are applied to the entire app), timeline filters are easier to put together thanks to a creation UI and they can be enabled for individual sections of the app. Furthermore, unlike muting a keyword or a user, filters allow you to exclude *or* include a keyword or tweet type, so you can hide tweets that match a certain keyword or type or **only view those tweets**, excluding everything else.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-06-23-001102.jpeg)\nMedia and Links filters in Tweetbot 4.4. \n\nFilters can be accessed by tapping the funnel icon on top of any timeline, next to the search bar. By default, Tweetbot ships with two built-in filters: Media (which is reminiscent of [the app’s original Media timeline](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/) ) and Links, which is a nice way to see all web links shared by people you follow (if used in the main timeline).\n\nThe core aspect of the feature, though, is that you can create your own filters without having to deal with complex regular expressions: just include or exclude some keywords, combine rules you want to match from the visual picker, and you’re set. Filters will be available at any point in any timeline, with the ability to activate them independently from each other throughout the app. For example, you can choose to view only links in your timeline and tweets without hashtags in your mentions, or view tweets from a user that don’t contain links or a keyword.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-06-23-000750.jpeg)\nSetting up a filter from scratch. \n\nWhen I was in San Francisco for WWDC, I used filters extensively to filter my timeline and mentions to specific types of content that let me see what people were saying about iOS 10. While that was possible with searches before, using filters is more intuitive and it only takes one tap to activate them and change the tweets displayed in Tweetbot. I can see how filters will become a popular choice to quickly refine which tweets are shown in a timeline thanks to their easy controls.\n\nI have some complaints about this first version of filters. For one, they don’t sync – you’ll have to recreate each filter from scratch on your other devices. Considering Tweetbot’s excellent iCloud sync, this strikes me as an omission that will be rectified soon. I also would have liked to see the filter icon to be placed in the top title bar, not in the search bar; with the current design, you can only activate a filter by scrolling all the way to the top first, whereas I’d like to filter my timeline as I’m catching up with it (say, after an Apple event). Last, all keywords in filters are joined by an OR operator behind the scenes – there’s no way to filter by “iOS 10” as a full string instead of the words iOS *or* 10. I’d like to see a way to add multiple-word keywords, such as quoting them or separating them by commas.\n\nOnce again, Tapbots is differentiating Tweetbot from the official Twitter app in ways that make sense for power users. Between [CloudKit sync](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/tweetbot-upgrades-to-cloudkit-sync\/), [topics](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-3-introduces-topics-for-easier-tweetstorm-creation\/), and now filters, there’s even more of a contrast between the simplistic approach of Twitter’s app and Tapbots’ powerful take. I’ve been happily using Tweetbot as my only Twitter client [since version 4.0 launched](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot\/) – it’s still the best option by far on the iPad Pro, and it keeps getting better on each release.\n\nTweetbot 4.4 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 4.4 Brings Timeline Filters](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/tweetbot-4-4-brings-timeline-filters\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 4.5 Brings iOS 10 Updates, Profile Notes\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2016-09-18-212908.jpeg)\nProfile notes and slightly richer notifications in Tweetbot 4.5. \n\nTapbots [released Tweetbot 4.5 today](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) with a few iOS 10 additions.\n\nIn the latest version, notifications are *slightly* richer: you won’t be able to preview entire conversation or DM threads in a notification, but at least the sender’s username and notification title will have a bold font for better visual separation. I would have liked to see even richer notifications with custom interfaces, and I also wonder if Tweetbot could use SiriKit’s messaging intents to send DMs. Perhaps Tapbots will consider deeper iOS 10 enhancements in the future.\n\nAlso new in this version, you can now add notes to user profiles. According to Tapbots, the feature is intended to add a brief note to remember why you followed someone; personally, I think it’s just as effective to remember why you don’t want to follow someone without blocking them. User notes are private, they sync with iCloud, and they can be accessed from the gear menu on a user’s profile.\n\nFinally, Tweetbot 4.5 supports smoother scrolling thanks to [iOS 10’s performance improvements](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-10-the-macstories-review\/29\/#everything-else) in this area. It’s not always noticeable, but I’m glad Tapbots implemented this feature for iOS 10 devices.\n\nTweetbot 4.5 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 4.5 Brings iOS 10 Updates, Profile Notes](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-4-5-brings-ios-10-updates-profile-notes\/)\n\n# Tweetbot Updated with Support for Longer Tweets\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&256px.png)\nWhen Twitter [rolled out support for longer tweets](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-reclaims-space-for-text-in-tweets\/) yesterday, we mentioned that Tweetbot – the popular third-party client – would soon support the new format natively. Tapbots has released updates to the iOS and macOS apps today that let you view and create longer tweets (where media, polls, and quotes don’t count against 140 characters) without having to rely on Twitter’s official app. You can get the iOS update [here](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot Updated with Support for Longer Tweets](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-updated-with-support-for-longer-tweets\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 4.6 Brings Image Support in DMs, New Compose UI for Replies\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2017-04-22-20-45-06.jpeg)\nThe new compose UI for replies in Tweetbot 4.6. \n\nIn an update [released today on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), Tapbots has started taking advantage of [Twitter’s more flexible third-party API](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/?s=twitter+api) to allow users to send images in private conversations (DMs). The feature – which has long been available in Twitter’s official app – is limited to static images for now (no videos or animated GIFs), although the Twitter API could make [more attachment types](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/rest\/direct-messages\/attaching-media) possible in the future.\n\nPerhaps more notably, Tweetbot 4.6 comes with a redesigned compose interface for replies. Similarly to Twitter’s iPhone app, Tweetbot 4.6 doesn’t count usernames [against the 140-character limit](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/twitter-replies-no-longer-count-usernames-against-140-character-limit\/). To present this change in functionality, Tapbots has opted for a Twitter-like design where usernames aren’t displayed in the compose box upon starting a reply. Instead, a “Replying to…” banner at the top of the screen highlights the tweet’s original author and other participants in a conversation. Tap the banner, and, like in the Twitter app, you’ll be a shown a popup with a list of users you’re replying to. The author at the top of the list can’t be de-selected; other users in the conversation can be removed by tapping on the blue checkmarks.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2017-04-22-20-48-12.jpeg)\nTwitter (left) and Tweetbot 4.6. \n\nWhile this design is similar to Twitter’s, it should be noted that Tweetbot limits this presentation to the compose view for replies. Unlike Twitter’s official apps, usernames are **still displayed** in the body of a tweet in both the Timeline and Mentions views, providing a familiar format that doesn’t force you to tap on the “Replying to…” banner from every section of the app. Personally, I believe Tapbots adopted a better solution than Twitter itself: the compose UI is nicer and usernames are easier to remove, but the timeline retains the familiar @usernames that add context to inline conversations.\n\nI’m curious to see how [Twitter’s new API roadmap](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2017\/building-the-future-of-the-twitter-api-platform) will impact third-party clients such as Tweetbot over the next few months. Tweetbot continues to be my daily Twitter client on every platform, and I hope Tapbots will be able to add even more native Twitter features in future updates (I’d love to have support for polls in Tweetbot).\n\nTweetbot 4.6 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-4-for-twitter\/id1018355599?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 4.6 Brings Image Support in DMs, New Compose UI for Replies](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/tweetbot-4-6-brings-image-support-in-dms-new-compose-ui-for-replies\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for iOS Adds 280-Character Tweet Support\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&untitled-151510167267161.jpg)\nYesterday, [Twitter extended the character limit of tweets](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-adopts-280-character-tweet-limit\/) to 280. Unlike [some features](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitterrific-for-macos-adds-poll-support-and-other-refinements\/), Twitter has made the new tweet length available to all third-party developers.\n\nFirst out of the gate is [Tweetbot by Tapbots](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id1018355599?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=linked). Less than 24 hours after Twitter’s announcement, Tweetbot users can use a full 280 characters in tweets. I expect we’ll see additional updates [from other Twitter client developers soon](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Twitterrific\/status\/928046008638103553).\n\nTweetbot [is available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id1018355599?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=linked).\n\n[Tweetbot for iOS Adds 280-Character Tweet Support](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-ios-adds-280-character-tweet-support\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 3 for Mac Review\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&screenshot-2018-05-14-18-02-261526340021612.png)\nTapbots has released [Tweetbot 3 for Mac](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=linked&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=12), which overhauls the app’s design, provides greater flexibility to manage multiple columns and navigate different parts of Twitter, and includes a dark mode. For the first time since it was introduced in 2012, Tapbots has also made version 3.0 a separate paid app, which means that existing and new users alike will have to pay $9.99 for the update.\n\n## Design\n\nAlthough Tweetbot 3.0 retains the basic look and feel of its predecessor, nearly every interface element of the app has been adjusted in some manner. Starting with the timeline view, the compose button has been moved to the bottom left-hand corner of the window, replacing the multi-column button. Previously, it was in the top right-hand corner next to the search button, which made it easy to click search inadvertently when you meant to compose a tweet and vice versa.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&side-by-side1526340089641.png)\nTweetbot version 2.5 (left) and version 3.0 (right) \n\nIndividual tweets have a different look too. Media included in quoted tweets is more prominent, retweet information has been moved to the top of a tweet, and tweet details show whether the person tweeting follows you. However, the most noticeable change is the dedicated row of light gray buttons along the bottom of each tweet for replying, liking, retweeting or quote-tweeting, and performing account or tweet actions. Previously, a tweet’s buttons were only visible if a tweet was selected or moused over.\n\nThe last two buttons in the row consolidate account and tweet-related actions found in a variety of places in Tweetbot 2.5. The button with the silhouette of a person accesses the same sort of actions you could previously find by right-clicking on a user’s avatar or visiting their profile page: public reply, Add\/Remove from Lists, Disable Retweets, Enable Notification, Open Profile in Safari, Unfollow, Mute for 24 Hours, Block User, and Block and Report for Spam.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&share1526340455147.png)\nTweetbot 3 (right) has share extension support via each tweet’s gear button. \n\nThe button with the gear icon includes the same tweet actions as the older version with the addition of the ability to open a tweet in Safari, Open Link\/Media, and Share. Opening a tweet in Safari is handy for voting in polls, for example, which you can’t do in third-party Twitter clients, but I don’t understand the purpose of Open Link\/Media, which requires an extra click compared to simply following a link in the body of a tweet, especially since the action only opens the last link in a tweet. My favorite addition to Tweetbot is the Share action, which accesses Mac app extensions making it simple to send a tweet’s link to other apps like Things, DEVONthink, Notes, or any other app you have installed that accepts URLs.\n\nThe row of buttons at the bottom of each tweet means fewer tweets fit vertically into Tweetbot’s window, but that can be mitigated by more font size options and the ability to hide media previews.[1](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-for-mac-review\/#fn-54281-1) Another new preference is an option to auto-play videos that appear in your timeline. Tweetbot 3 also debuts a new dark mode that sets the background of displayed tweets to dark gray.\n\n## Navigation and Column Management\n\nThe other change to Tweetbot you’ll notice right away is that the sidebar for navigating different sections has been rearranged. The changes go deeper than a simple reordering though. Coupled with a drop-down navigation menu at the top of Tweetbot’s window, the update makes navigating Tweetbot easier than ever.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&titlebar-1526341727696.png)\nTweetbot 3 adds title bar navigation within sidebar sections. \n\nTimeline navigation has not changed, but right below that is a new bell icon for Notifications, which includes what were separate Mentions and Activity sections. When you first open Notifications, you’ll see that mentions, likes, retweets, and follows are all combined into a unified chronological list, which, frankly, I don’t like. Fortunately, you’re not stuck with the combined list. The dropdown menu that’s accessible by clicking on the word ‘Navigation’ in the title bar lets you filter the list so that it includes only Mentions or Activity. By limiting Notifications to Mentions, my Activity is now an extra click away, but that’s fine because it’s not a section I regularly use anyway.\n\nWhen you are in the Direct Message and Search sections, the title bar navigation menu lists your ten most recent direct messages and your first ten saved searches. The navigation menu for the Account, Likes, Muted, and List sections all provide quick access to your profile (a slightly different presentation of the account view), tweets, likes, mutes, and lists.\n\nThe update also makes it easier navigate multiple accounts. When you click on your avatar, you can click on other accounts you’ve added to Tweetbot to view them in the same window or click on the arrow to the right of the account name to open it in a separate window, which was something that was previously only available as a right-click action.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&pip1526341122632.png)\nDrag the multi-column button to the right to open additional columns. \n\nTweetbot has also added an interesting new way to open multiple columns. When you mouse over the lower right-hand corner of the window, a bright blue column button animates into view. Dragging the button to the right opens a new column. You can also fling the button to the right in one quick motion to open multiple columns at once. It’s a simple, fast maneuver that’s a big improvement over the old version of Tweetbot.\n\nMy only reservation about the feature is that it doesn’t always seem to open columns with the sections in the same order. It’s easy to switch to another section using the navigation menu in the title bar, but if the app is going to automatically open different sections for each column, it feels like they ought to follow the order of the sections in the sidebar.\n\nThere are many other little tweaks to Tweetbot 3 throughout the UI, but there are a couple of things missing too. Support for Favstar, which announced over the weekend that [it is shutting down on June 19th](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Favstar\/status\/995389088776663040), has understandably been removed. So has read-it-later service support. Pocket and Reading List are available as extensions through the Share menu, but the removal means that users of Instapaper, which doesn’t have a Mac app, are out of luck.\n\nTweetbot 3 is an all-new app, which means new and existing users who want to use it will need to purchase the new version. The update provides a solid UI refresh, new ways to customize its look, and greater navigation flexibility. I’m happy with the update, especially the integration of share extensions and new ways to navigate my accounts, but I also don’t feel like any of the changes are must-haves. That said, as an app that I’ve used on my Mac every day for years without paying for an update, I don’t personally have an issue with paying for Tweetbot 3.\n\nHowever, if you’re a light Twitter user and are happy with version 2.5 of Tweetbot, you can stick with it. Tweetbot 2.5 will continue to work, and a bug-fix update is coming. The old version won’t receive new features, but if version 3 doesn’t have features you find compelling, you can wait until it does or until version 2.5 no longer works.\n\nTweetbot 3  [is available on the Mac App Store for $9.99](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=linked&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=12).\n\n[Tweetbot 3 for Mac Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-for-mac-review\/)\n\n# MacStories\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&256px.png)\n[Tapbots announced](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tweetbot\/status\/563070797456367617) today that Tweetbot 2.0 for Mac will be released on Yosemite and it’ll be a free update for existing customers.\n\n> Tweetbot for Yosemite has been more work than anticipated, but it is coming…and yes, it will be a free update! [http:\/\/t.co\/HOQI4fSdsO](http:\/\/t.co\/HOQI4fSdsO)  \n\n> — Tweetbot by Tapbots (@tweetbot) [February 4, 2015](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tweetbot\/status\/563070797456367617)  \n\n[My preference on iOS](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/) these days may go to Twitter’s official app, but, on the desktop, Twitter for Mac is in a very sad state, whereas [Tweetbot is a great client](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/) with tons of handy features. I’m curious to see if Tapbots will manage to add support for modern Twitter features, but, overall, the visual refresh is already looking good. Considering that it’ll be a free update, you can [buy the app today from the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), get your Twitter token in, and wait for the new version to launch.\n\nTwitter clients used to be a [UI design playground](http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2009\/04\/twitter_clients_playground). The growing popularity of Twitter, an open API, and the [rapid takeoff](http:\/\/www.apple.com\/pr\/library\/2009\/04\/24Apples-Revolutionary-App-Store-Downloads-Top-One-Billion-in-Just-Nine-Months.html) of the App Store contributed to the creation of a defining genre of mobile software in 2009 and 2010: the Twitter client for iPhone. In the golden days of third-party Twitter apps, a good new client would come out at least every month, with several developers pitching their own ideas for what was meant to be a mobile-first communication network.\n\niPhone apps and the Twitter API were a perfect match five years ago. Twitter made sense as a social network in your pocket; Apple’s iPhone OS and [newly launched App Store](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/pr\/library\/2008\/07\/14iPhone-App-Store-Downloads-Top-10-Million-in-First-Weekend.html) made that a reality. As a user, there was little friction in trying multiple Twitter clients: because Twitter data was always “in the cloud”, changing clients was like choosing a different outfit each day. The core Twitter experience would always be the same; the design and preferences around it would differ from client to client.\n\nThat was a time of astonishing innovation in mobile app design. Twitterrific, the [first native Twitter client](http:\/\/iconfactory.com\/software\/twitterrific_history) for iPhone, effectively [invented key aspects](http:\/\/furbo.org\/2011\/03\/11\/twitterrific-firsts\/) of modern Twitter interaction and terminology; [Tweetie](http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tweetie), perhaps the most popular Twitter client of its time, [pioneered touch interaction paradigms](http:\/\/www.jeremydstanley.com\/twitter-iphone-history.html) such as pull to refresh. And then there were [Weet](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/iphone\/weet-review\/), [Osfoora](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/osfoora-hd-review\/), [Birdfeed](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/06\/29\/birdfeed-finally-an-iphone-twitter-client-to-match-tweeties-speed-and-simplicity\/), [Twittelator](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twittelator-review\/), [Echofon](http:\/\/www.echofon.com\/twitter\/iphone\/), [Tweetings](http:\/\/www.tweetings.net\/site\/), [TweetList](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tweetlist), and dozens of other apps that helped refine and redefine the idea of what Twitter on an iPhone could be.\n\nGood Twitter clients weren’t easy to create, but the challenge they packed was intriguing and flexible. As a Twitter developer, you needed to design an app that would primarily display textual information (this was [before Twitter photos](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2011\/searchphotos) ), handle hyperlinks, manage interactions between users, account for different network conditions, possibly integrate with third-party sharing services years before iOS 8, and, most of all, be fast, responsive, and easy to use. The constraints of Twitter clients in 2009\/2010 freed many from the struggle of coming up with an original app idea.\n\nIf you’re using an iOS app [❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/3\/#fn:1) today, there’s a good chance some of its features or design ideas first appeared in a Twitter client five years ago.\n\nWe know how the story moved forward. In April 2010, Twitter realized that they needed an official iOS presence on the App Store, so they bought Loren Brichter’s Tweetie, [relaunched it as Twitter for iPhone](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2010\/twitter-for-iphone), and Brichter released the ( [unsurprisingly genius](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twitter-for-ipad-review\/) ) Twitter for iPad.[❲2❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/3\/#fn:2) For a while, it looked like Tweetie would live on, but then Twitter started adding [questionable features](http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2011\/03\/20\/why-the-quick-bar-dickbar-is-still-so-offensive) to it, and [it became clear](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/) that the third-party Twitter client would be *persona non grata* on the App Store.\n\nOver the years, there have been countless examples of Twitter prioritizing their own app and a closed ecosystem approach over third-party developers and improvements to the API. From the [infamous quadrant](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2012\/changes-coming-to-twitter-api) and [token limits](http:\/\/www.marco.org\/2012\/11\/16\/twitter-being-a-dick-again) to the [display guidelines](http:\/\/theaxx.net\/posts\/2013\/2\/20\/on-tweetbot-and-twitter-display-guidlines) and constant reticence about bringing new features to the API, Twitter has been nebulous in providing an official stance on third-party clients after the Tweetie acquisition, but the subtext of their announcements has always been fairly clear to everyone in the third-party scene. Twitter wanted people to use their official app, not a third-party client.\n\nBefore the Twitter acquisition in 2010, I was using a bunch of third-party clients but I had eventually elected Tweetie as my preferred one. After Brichter’s app turned into Twitter for iPhone, I stuck to it for a while, but then I was allured by Tapbots’ promise of a Twitter client for power users. As I wrote in [my original review](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), Tweetbot had everything I was looking for, and that was before Tapbots would bring [fantastic new features](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/) that made it even more versatile.\n\nI loved Tweetbot in a way that I didn’t love any other app for iOS. I have extremely vivid and personal memories of getting the first beta builds of Tweetbot for iPhone and iPad, and, until [Editorial came around](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/editorial-for-ipad-review\/), Tweetbot was the app I spent most of my days in. From 2011 until earlier this year, I used Tweetbot every working hour of every day. Tweetbot *was* Twitter for me.\n\nThat’s not to say that I stopped checking in on the state of other Twitter clients for iOS, but I certainly became less curious because I had found *the one*. I’ve primarily continued to [keep an eye on Twitterrific](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/twitterrific\/), but I largely ignored the third-party space for two years. Last year, the launch of iOS 7 motivated me to look for new Twitter clients again and I stumbled across new versions of [TweetLogix](http:\/\/www.onloft.com\/), Echofon, and [Tweet7](http:\/\/tweet7app.com\/), but my affection for Tweetbot and the fact that the majority of my Internet friends were using Tapbots’ app convinced me that I didn’t have to look for anything else.\n\nI like to think that I’m naturally curious, but, for my Twitter client of choice, I had become complacent and fixated on the belief that the official Twitter app could never offer anything valuable again. Earlier this year, an idea started poking me in the back of my mind: if the rest of the world is using the Twitter app for iOS, shouldn’t I give it another chance?\n\nThis realization came from a simple occasion: I was having dinner out with some friends, and I noticed that they were using the Twitter app for iPhone to read news and follow their favorite celebrities. Tweetbot was Twitter for me and I was certain that I could never switch to another app, but they seemed to be just fine with the official app and its lack of streaming, mute filters, quick actions, and all those other great details Tweetbot had. “They’re not power users”, I thought, and that settled it.\n\nStill. For someone who likes to think he’s curious and writes about apps for a living, my unwillingness to *at least try* the app from the service I use every day was remarkable in its shortsightedness. Twitter had changed since 2011, and it wasn’t meant for power users. The rest of the world was using Twitter through the official apps and I thought that I knew better than anyone else. So, a fun experiment began:\n\nI started using the official Twitter client as my main Twitter app on my iPhone and iPad.\n\nFor the past six months, I’ve been reevaluating my entire Twitter experience based on the apps I use to read tweets and interact with people. The idea made a lot more sense once I stepped out of my preconceptions: I wanted to understand what 2014 Twitter was like and if that meant sacrificing my nerd cred and use a [Muggle](http:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muggle) ’s Twitter app, so be it. But at the same time, [I’ve gone back and forth](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-5-iphone-6-support-interactive-notifications-and-ios-8-extensions\/) between Twitter and third-party clients, primarily out of habit, but also because they still offer powerful features and design details that I appreciate.\n\nI didn’t want to focus on the history of Twitter clients, my thoughts on Twitter’s policies, or every single Twitter app currently available for iOS 8. I also couldn’t compare every single feature or design decision for every possible scenario a Twitter client could be used in.\n\nInstead, I attempted to address my curiosity from a utilitarian standpoint. Given the three most popular Twitter apps for iOS (Twitter, Tweetbot, and Twitterrific), I wanted to slowly evaluate their features for my use case. To do this, I assembled a list of features *I need* a Twitter client to be capable of handling and I started taking notes every time I switched between clients. I’ve been doing this since early June.\n\nI’ve spent weeks comparing features and changing apps to understand the kind of experience they want to promote. But implementation details and design differences aside, I also kept wondering the same question: was the real Twitter different from the third-party clients I used for three years?\n\nWhat’s 2014 Twitter like on iOS?\n\n[Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-clients-in-2014\/)\n\nFor the past two months, I’ve been switching back and forth between [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) and Twitter’s official app for iOS in a personal quest to understand what’s the best Twitter client for me today. Tweetbot 3.5, [available today on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), has given me the biggest incentive to keep using Tapbots’ app yet: integration with iOS 8 extensions in my Twitter timeline.\n\n[Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-5-iphone-6-support-interactive-notifications-and-ios-8-extensions\/)\n\nFollowing an update [released on iOS last month](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-4-adds-support-for-multiple-twitter-images\/), [Tweetbot for Mac](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/mac\/) has been updated to version 1.6 today, adding support for multiple images shared through Twitter’s sharing service. The update also includes a “Play” button for Instagram thumbnails and various bug fixes.\n\nSupport for multiple Twitter images mirrors the implementation of the iPhone app, with inline previews for tweets that contain multiple photos and the ability to share multiple images at once by attaching them (up to four) to the compose box. Tweets with multiple images show a carousel in their detail views, and, on OS X, you can click on the image indicators to move across pictures manually. Both on iOS and OS X, Tweetbot still doesn’t support Twitter’s animated GIFs, [introduced by the company](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/linked\/twitter-adds-support-for-animated-gifs-on-web-android-and-iphone\/) in June.\n\nTweetbot for Mac 1.6 is [available on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) 3.4, released today on the App Store, adds support for viewing and posting multiple Twitter images, a play icon for Instagram video thumbnails, and enhancements to tweet detail views.\n\n[Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-4-adds-support-for-multiple-twitter-images\/)\n\n[Tweetbot for Mac](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/mac\/), Tapbots’ desktop version of its popular Twitter client, was updated last night with support for a new large thumbnail option in the timeline, a refreshed design of inline image previews, and a fix for three-finger gestures.\n\nFollowing [Tweetbot 3.3 for iPhone](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-3-adds-avenir-font-option-large-thumbnails\/), Tweetbot 1.5 for Mac adds large thumbnails as an option in the app’s Preferences. Large thumbnails retain the capability of being right-clicked to access a contextual menu, and they bring a slightly redesigned preview in the tweet detail view as well. In my tests, loading large thumbnails with proper resolution required deleting Tweetbot’s account cache under Preferences > Account.\n\nFor users who enabled three-finger navigation gestures on their Macs, Tweetbot will now respect that setting and allow to swipe with three fingers to navigate back and forth between tweets, timelines, and other views of the app.\n\nTweetbot for Mac is available at [$19.99 on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline). You can read our original review [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/).\n\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), Tapbots’ Twitter client for iPhone that was [relaunched](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/) in October for iOS 7, has been updated today with new display options and the possibility to remove tweets that match a filter.\n\nFor the past few months, Tapbots has been working on improvements to Tweetbot’s presentation and text size controls, adding new settings in [version 3.1](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-1-brings-text-size-controls-timeline-switcher-quick-actions\/) and a [night theme in 3.2](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-2-brings-night-theme-account-reordering-and-quick-switching\/) alongside additions to account management and reordering. In today’s update, Tweetbot gets a new font option in the Preferences to enable Avenir as the app’s primary typeface, as well as a new setting to enlarge thumbnails in the timeline. The latter makes Tweetbot more akin to the official Twitter app for iPhone in that it displays large photos (and app icon previews for iTunes links) that give a better idea of a media item inline without having to show the tweet detail view.\n\nJust like Tweetbot for Mac, Tweetbot for iPhone can now remove tweets that match a mute filter as soon as the filter is added. Through a dialog box, the app will offer to remove matching tweets that have already been loaded in the timeline. The option is particularly welcome if you, for instance, wake up in the morning and realize you don’t want to scroll through hundreds of tweets about an event that happened overnight.\n\nTweetbot 3.3 further refines Tapbots’ vision for Tweetbot 3 on the iPhone, and it’s [available now on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\nAfter a [3.1 update](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-1-brings-text-size-controls-timeline-switcher-quick-actions\/) that added text size controls, timeline switching options, and quick actions, Tapbots are back today with a second major update to [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) that brings a night theme, account reordering and quick switching, plus various bug fixes. [Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-2-brings-night-theme-account-reordering-and-quick-switching\/)\n\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) for iPhone [may have grown up](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/), but it hasn’t forgotten about the features and design decisions that made it a powerful and popular Twitter client among iOS users for the past two years. Tweetbot 3.1, [available today on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), improves upon last month’s major release by bringing back some old features of Tweetbot 2.x and introducing new ones, always taking advantage of iOS 7’s design and structure in interesting ways. [Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-1-brings-text-size-controls-timeline-switcher-quick-actions\/)\n\n[Previous page](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/2\/) [Next page](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/4\/) \n\n- - - -\n\n#### Page 2\n\nIn [Tweetbot 3](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/), Tapbots removed the ability to post tweets longer than 140 characters using built-in services for text upload. While I understand that it wasn’t one of Tweetbot’s most used features, its removal got me thinking: would it be possible to replicate the feature using Dropbox and plain text files in an automated iOS workflow? I came up with a solution that requires [Launch Center Pro](http:\/\/contrast.co\/launch-center-pro\/) and [Drafts](http:\/\/agiletortoise.com\/drafts\/), and I’m quite happy with it.\n\n[Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/tweetbot-workflow-upload-and-share-dropbox-text-files\/)\n\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) is, by far, the iPhone app that I use the most on a daily basis. It’s not just that I keep Twitter open essentially all day to check for news, talk to friends, or post GIFs: since I got the first beta of the original Tweetbot [three years ago](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/28367698210), the app has become so ingrained in my workflow that I wouldn’t be able to switch back to any other client that doesn’t have the same capabilities. What started as a moderately advanced take on Twitter clients by Tapbots has evolved with time into a powerful app that spans three platforms and that comes with dozens of unique features and a solid engine that, for me, has no equal. I don’t say it lightly: because of Tweetbot’s feature set, I have been able to reliably communicate with other people (via DM or Mentions), reference tweets for articles, or [build complex workflows](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/convert-twitter-com-urls-to-tweetbot-links\/) that have allowed me to be more efficient, faster, and generally happier with Twitter.\n\nThat’s why I take major changes to Tweetbot’s overall structure and design, such as Tweetbot 3 for iOS 7, very seriously. Tweetbot 3, [released today as a new app sold at $2.99 on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline)  (launch sale), is many things at once: it’s Tapbots’ first foray into the iOS 7 design aesthetic, which marks a radical departure from the small studio’s former visual style; it’s a profound reimagination of Tweetbot’s looks, animations, and sounds, which had gone largely unchanged since 2011; and it’s a confirmation of Tweetbot’s existing feature set with changes aimed at further enhancing the app’s functionality and making room for future additions. It’s iPhone-only, with a new version for iPad coming next.\n\nI have been using Tweetbot 3 every day on my iPhone 5 for the past couple of months. I think that I have a good understanding of the decisions behind the app’s redesign, feature changes, and complete embrace of iOS 7’s visual and hierarchical approach to building interfaces. With version 3.0, Tweetbot, the robotic toy for your Twitter stream, eschews its mechanical roots and graduates to a modern, fluid, and *fun* assistant that, in the process, is still Tweetbot. I wouldn’t be able to go back to the old Tweetbot now, but I also think that getting used to the new app will take some time. [Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/)\n\nFollowing the [2.8 update released on iOS in April](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/), Tapbots today updated [Tweetbot for Mac](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/mac\/) to version 1.3, which adds various tweaks to the interface as well as the media timeline that debuted on the iPhone and iPad.\n\nTo access the new media timeline, which provides an inline media view of all timelines in Tweetbot, you can hit ⌘F and click on the icon next to the search bar, or, alternatively, choose View > Media Timeline (⌥⌘M with the keyboard). The media timeline retains the same functionality and design that Tapbots first brought to the iPhone; to switch back to the default timeline, you can click another icon next to the search bar or go to View > Default Timeline (⌥⌘T).\n\nComplying with Twitter’s new display guidelines, the tweet detail view now comes with retweet and favorite counters – again, implemented just like in Tweetbot for iOS. And alongside a series of bug fixes and improvements, Tweetbot 1.3 brings a welcome enhancement to profile views: besides Cover Image support, you can now double-click the titlebar on a profile to scroll back to the top. Double-clicking again will scroll a profile’s timeline to the top as well.\n\nTweetbot for Mac 1.3 is [available now on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12).\n\nSean Korzdorfer shares a Tweetbot tip that I didn’t know about: you can construct complex searches with boolean operators and filters and launch them [with a URL scheme](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme), both on OS X and iOS. And not just regular searches – you can apply a *query* to look for specific keywords inside a Tweetbot search.\n\nBasically, Sean is using Tweetbot searches to replace RSS feeds. By saving searches that filter out RTs, mentions, and tweets in foreign languages, he receives a stream of tweets containing links from a specific set of users. Sean has turned his searches into [Alfred workflows](http:\/\/www.alfredapp.com\/) for Tweetbot on the Mac, and I thought I could do the same on iOS.\n\nSure enough, here’s a Launch Center Pro action to launch a Tweetbot search for links (no RTs, no mentions) from users I care about:\n\n>   \n```\ntweetbot:\/\/\/search?query=from%3Amacrumors%20OR%20from%3Averge%20OR%20from%3Adaringfireball%20OR%20from%3Apolygonall%20OR%20from%3Akotaku%20OR%20from%3Amacdrifter_feed%20OR%20from%3Areneritchie%20OR%20from%3Amattalexand%20OR%20from%3Anateboateng%20OR%20from%3Adujkan%20OR%20from%3Amarkgurman%20OR%20from%3Apanzer%20filter%3Alinks%20-filter%3Amentions%20-filter%3Aretweets%20lang%3Aen%20[prompt]\n```\n\nAnd here it is decoded for reading purposes:\n\n>   \n```\ntweetbot:\/\/\/search?query=from:macrumors OR from:verge OR from:daringfireball OR from:polygonall OR from:kotaku OR from:macdrifter_feed OR from:reneritchie OR from:mattalexand OR from:nateboateng OR from:dujkan OR from:markgurman OR from:panzer filter:links -filter:mentions -filter:retweets lang:en [prompt]\n```\n\nThe URL action ends with a `[prompt]` for Launch Center Pro, but that can also be a `[[draft]]` for Drafts. You’re not forced to launch the search URL with a keyword – if you don’t enter anything in the prompt, Tweetbot will display *all* links from the search (which is why you probably don’t want to use Drafts for this, as it can’t launch an action from an empty draft). Also, you can see that the first portion of the URL isn’t percent-encoded, but the one after the `query` parameter is. For this, [Launch Center Pro’s encode\/decode actions](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/launch-center-pro-1-1\/) can come in handy.\n\nI am subscribed to a series of Twitter lists to discover interesting links on a daily basis, but these complex searches have the advantage of filtering out RTs and mentions, providing a cleaner, links-only experience.\n\nEver since its [original release two years ago](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), I’ve always wished Tweetbot could provide filters to separate the standard timeline from a “media” one containing pictures and videos. After the launch of [Twitter’s own photo service](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twitter#Integrated_photo-sharing_service) and rise in popularity of services like Instagram, usage of pictures – either photos or screenshots – among the people I follow has skyrocketed. Apps like TweetGlass (nèe [Quip](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/quip-a-new-ipad-twitter-app-with-a-focus-on-conversations\/) ) succesfully explored the concept of letting users browse “media updates” in a dedicated feed, so why not Tweetbot?\n\nThe latest version of Tapbots’ client, [available today](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), does just that: it adds a media timeline to show only supported images and video tweets (the ones that you’d normally see displayed inline as thumbnails). [Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/)\n\nLast night, Tweetbot for iOS was updated with [support for the Twitter 1.1 API](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-1-2-brings-notifications-for-specific-users-vine-previews-ui-tweaks\/), which, [among various requirements](http:\/\/blog.mikebeas.com\/2013\/02\/13\/tweetbot-and-the-updated-twitter-display-guidelines\/), includes the need of linking a tweet’s timestamp – the date and time when it was sent – to its unique URL on twitter.com. In Tweetbot, you can now open the tweet detail view and tap on the timestamp to automatically open the Twitter website in your default browser; in terms of interaction, I like this change because it lets me open tweets in Google Chrome with just one tap.\n\nIn thinking about the update last night, I realized that:\n\n* My team and I use iMessage for daily communication;\n* The majority of URLs we share are Twitter URLs;\n* We all use Tweetbot on iOS and OS X;\n* Easier browser access means easier bookmarklet triggering;\n* [Drafts](http:\/\/agiletortoise.com\/drafts) can access iMessage.\n\nAnd I concluded that:\n\n* I could chain every piece of the puzzle together;\n* Hopefully somebody else will find it useful and adapt the workflow to other similar scenarios.\n\nTherefore, I created a browser bookmarklet, a Python script, and a Drafts action to automate the entire process and demonstrate how you can convert Twitter URLs to `tweetbot:\/\/` URLs and send text from [Pythonista](http:\/\/omz-software.com\/pythonista\/) to Drafts.\n\n[As usual](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/url-scheme\/), I am posting the following workflow as a proof of concept that you can modify and adapt to your needs. For instance, you can change the action that is triggered in Drafts, the [x-success](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/) parameter that will be triggered, or the way Twitter links are converted to Tweetbot-specific URLs.\n\n[Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/chaining-tweetbot-pythonista-drafts-and-imessage-for-urls\/)\n\nTweetbot for Mac, Tapbots’ Twitter client that [I first reviewed in October 2012](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/), has been updated today to version 1.2, which is available on the Mac App Store. Among the notable features of this new version, Tapbots is introducing notifications for specific users, support for inline Flickr and Vine previews, and compliance with the Twitter 1.1 API. [Read more](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-1-2-brings-notifications-for-specific-users-vine-previews-ui-tweaks\/)\n\nTweetbot 2.7, released today for the iPhone and iPad, comes with a new Browser setting to specify an external app for opening links. I have been testing the feature and I’m a big fan of this update.\n\nIn the Settings, you can now choose to open links directly in Safari, Google Chrome, or 1Password. There are two ways to do this: you can choose to keep opening links in Tweetbot’s own web view and *then* forward them to your browser of choice; or you can skip Tweetbot’s web view altogether and go *directly* to a different browser upon tapping a link.\n\nOpening links in Safari and 1Password doesn’t have anything special to it aside from the fact that you’ll be taken out of Tweetbot and into another browser. The 1Password integration is particularly useful as it is, essentially, the same idea behind [my bookmarklet](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/1password-4-1\/), only available inside Tweetbot: if you see a link for a website that you also want to log into, you can use 1Password’s built-in browser to access it.\n\nUsing Chrome alongside Tweetbot is my new favorite option, as it leverages Chrome’s support for [x-callback-url](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/) to enable a completely automated workflow to open Chrome and go back to Tweetbot. If you open a link in Google Chrome, a new tab will open showing a back button labeled “Tweetbot”; once you’re done reading, you can hit that button to automatically close the tab and be taken back to your position in the Tweetbot timeline. Chrome is smart in hiding the back button if you navigate to other pages from the Tweetbot-created tab; the browser also remembers the “special” tab if you switch to other tabs and then go back to the one created by Tweetbot. There’s a minor bug in this version that will redirect to the Tweetbot’s Timeline when you open a link from Mentions, but Tapbots is aware of it. For me, this is a very welcome addition to Tweetbot as it allows my two most-used iOS apps to better communicate with each other without requiring me to manually move between apps. I can get all the benefits of using an external browser (Facebook sharing, using [bookmarklets](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/bookmarklet\/) ) while still being able to go back to Tweetbot seamlessly.\n\nFor Flickr and Vine users, Tweetbot 2.7 also adds inline previews. Vine’s short videos are shown with a standard iOS video player that has a play\/pause button.\n\nTweetbot 2.7 is a minor, yet useful update for Chrome and 1Password users who have been wishing the app could open links in other browsers. You can find the update on the App Store ( [iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-iphone%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), [iPad](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-for-twitter-ipad%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) ).\n\nAn update to Tweetbot for Mac – my [go-to Twitter client](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/) – was released today on the App Store. Tweetbot 1.1 doesn’t bring major new features, but it’s got a fair amount of bug fixes and minor improvements that I like.\n\nFor Mountain Lion users, there’s an “All Notifications” option in the Settings to, literally, receive all notifications for your stream. This means you’ll see every tweet from every user you follow show up in Notification Center as soon as they tweet. I can’t use this because I follow too many people (I would get a notification every few seconds), but it can be useful for timelines following less users. What I really like is the option to show a Visual Sync Marker (like on iOS) and to globally invoke the app\/new tweet window with a hotkey.\n\nLast, there are many other fixes and improvements such as new keyboard shortcuts, better “pin to top” for non-streaming columns, and better compatibility with [Moom](http:\/\/manytricks.com\/moom\/). Tweetbot continues to be my favorite Twitter client on the Mac and it’s available at [$19.99 on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12).\n\n[Previous page](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/3\/) [Next page](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/5\/) \n\n[MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/page\/3\/)\n\n# Twitter Announces New End-of-Life Date for APIs and Pricing That Affects Third-Party Apps\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&twitter_logo_bird_transparent_png1464104142328.png)\nIn April, [Twitter delayed a transition to a new API](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-delays-transition-to-new-api-that-threatens-third-party-clients\/) that was expected to have a significant impact on third-party Twitter clients like [Twitterrific](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id580311103?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=linked) and [Tweetbot](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id1018355599?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=linked). The delay came in the wake of an outcry from users of third-party Twitter clients prompted by developers who banded together to [encourage users to complain to Twitter](http:\/\/apps-of-a-feather.com\/) about the API changes that were set to take effect on June 19, 2018. Today, Twitter announced that those changes would go forward on [August 16, 2018](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/16\/twitter-delays-shutdown-of-legacy-apis-by-3-months-as-it-launches-a-replacement\/) – about two months later than originally planned.\n\nYesterday, in [an interview with Sarah Perez of TechCruch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/15\/tweetbot-3-arrives-with-a-new-look-and-a-reprieve-from-twitters-api-changes\/), Paul Haddad of Tapbots, the maker Tweetbot, said:\n\n> “Twitter has a replacement API that – if we’re given access to – we’ll be able to use to replace almost all of the functionality that they are deprecating,” he explains. “On Mac, the worst case scenario is that we won’t be able to show notifications for Likes and Retweets. Notifications for Tweets, Mentions, Quotes, DMs and Follows will be delayed one to two minutes,” Haddad adds.  \n\n> He also says that Tweets wouldn’t stream in as they get posted, but instead would come in one to two minutes later as the app would automatically poll for them. (This is the same as how the iOS app works now when connected to LTE – it uses the polling API.)  \n\nIn addition to announcing transition date, Twitter announced pricing for its new API, and it’s expensive. A subscription covering 100-250 users will cost $2899\/month, which works out to over $11 per user for 250 users. Anyone with over 250 users, which would include all the major third-party Twitter clients, is advised to contact Twitter for enterprise pricing. However, the pricing on the API’s lower tiers doesn’t leave much room for optimism.\n\nThird-party clients that can’t or don’t want to pay those prices will have to make do without timeline streaming and push notifications for likes and retweets. Other notifications will be delayed approximately 1-2 minutes [according to statements by Haddad to TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/15\/tweetbot-3-arrives-with-a-new-look-and-a-reprieve-from-twitters-api-changes\/).\n\nFor its part, [Twitter has made it clear](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/16\/twitter-delays-shutdown-of-legacy-apis-by-3-months-as-it-launches-a-replacement\/), that the functionality of the old APIs will not be coming to the new APIs:\n\n> “As a few developers have noticed, there’s no streaming connection capability or home timeline data, which are only used by a small amount of developers (roughly 1% of monthly active apps),” writes Twitter Senior Product Manager, Kyle Weiss, in a blog post. “As we retire aging APIs, we have no plans to add these capabilities to Account Activity API or create a new streaming service for related use cases.”  \n\nWe contacted The Iconfactory, the maker of Twitterrific, and Tapbots,[1](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-announces-new-end-of-life-date-for-apis-and-pricing-that-affects-third-party-apps\/#fn-54288-1) the maker of Tweetbot, to ask about the impact of the API changes on third-party clients and Twitter users. According to Iconfactory developer Craig Hockenberry:\n\n> A lot of functionality that users of third-party apps took for granted is going away. That was the motivation for the [apps-of-a-feather.com](http:\/\/apps-of-a-feather.com\/)  website - to soften the blow of this announcement.   \n\nHockenberry elaborated that The Iconfactory has reached out to Twitter regarding enterprise pricing for the new APIs, but says that he doesn’t anticipate the pricing will be affordable absent a significant discount.\n\nOn the one hand, this latest blow to third-party Twitter clients may be something [that some users](https:\/\/512pixels.net\/2018\/05\/twitters-api-change-has-a-date-again-august-16\/), including me, are willing to tolerate. On the other hand, this is yet another example of third-party client hostility demonstrated by Twitter stretching back at least five years that doesn’t bode well for the long-term viability of those apps. I asked Hockenberry what he thinks the changes mean to third-party Twitter apps. His response:\n\n> Long term, I don’t think there will be any apps other than the official one. I also don’t think Twitter realizes that many long-time users, who are highly engaged on the service, are also the people who use third-party apps. These folks will look elsewhere for their social media needs.  \n\nGiven Twitter’s repeated hostility towards third-party clients, that’s a hard sentiment to argue against and one that gets my attention more than Twitter’s announcement. I can live with the latest changes to Twitter’s API, but if third-party developers conclude that their time and resources are better spent elsewhere, I expect the end of the Twitter I know and use today is closer than I thought.\n\n[Twitter Announces New End-of-Life Date for APIs and Pricing That Affects Third-Party Apps](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-announces-new-end-of-life-date-for-apis-and-pricing-that-affects-third-party-apps\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 5 for iOS Brings a Redesign, Dedicated GIPHY Support, and a New Dark Mode\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2018-10-17-15-24-41.png)\n[Tweetbot 5 for iOS](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id1018355599?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=MacStories) is out with a new look that more closely resembles the latest Mac version, [which was redesigned in May](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-for-mac-review\/). Tapbots has also added a handful of additional features, some of which mirror additions to the Mac version and others of which are unique to iOS.\n\nBefore you even launch Tweetbot, you’ll notice that the icon has been changed to reflect the style of the Mac app. After years of variations on the old icon, it’s taken some getting used to the new one, which I think looks angry, but whether you like the new design or not, I like having the same icon on both platforms.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2018-10-17-15-33-07.png)\nA comparison of Tweetbot 4’s timeline and profile views to the new ones in Tweetbot 5. \n\nThe iconography throughout Tweetbot 5 uses a thicker stroke like the Mac app, which gives the icons more weight and a bolder look. When you open a tweet’s detail view, Tweetbot now indicates whether the person whose tweet you’re viewing follows you, though it doesn’t do the same for other tweets if the one you opened is part of a thread.\n\nProfiles have been redesigned too. Avatars are bigger and to the left of your bio, profile backgrounds are now clearly visible, the text is left-justified, and follower and following statistics are more prominent. The changes take up more vertical space but are easier to read and look nicer than in the past. Lastly in the area of design, there’s a new dark mode throughout the app that looks much better on OLED iPhones than Tweetbot 4’s dark mode.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2018-10-17-15-33-26.png)\nTweetbot 5’s tweet detail view (right) shows off the new dark mode, bolder icons, and auto-play GIFs. \n\nIn addition to the redesign, Tapbots has added a few new features to Tweetbot 5 too. Like the Mac app, Tweetbot on iOS can now autoplay GIFs and video. The feature is turned on by default but can be turned off in settings.\n\nGIFs are easier to add to tweets too. There’s a GIF button in the compose view that opens a GIPHY search field when tapped. Descriptions can be added to images from the action sheet that opens when you tap on an image in the tweet you’re composing, which is an excellent accessibility addition for VoiceOver users. Tweetbot has added haptic feedback throughout the app too.\n\nFinally, there is a new tip jar feature in Tweetbot’s settings that lets users make a $0.99, $2.99, or $4.99 tip to support the development of the app, which is something that Twitterrific started doing a couple of years ago.\n\nFrom a feature standpoint, Tweetbot 5 is a modest update, but one that I’ve enjoyed using during the beta. The dark mode looks much better on OLED phones, and the design changes give the app a fresh new feel. I wasn’t sure I’d like the addition of auto-play video, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised to find I do, though it’s easy enough to turn off if you don’t. The haptic feedback is another good addition that provides a subtle tactile response to actions taken in the app.\n\nTweetbot 5 is a free update for existing users and [is available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/id1018355599?at=11lbfL&amp;ct=MacStories).\n\n[Tweetbot 5 for iOS Brings a Redesign, Dedicated GIPHY Support, and a New Dark Mode](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 6 Moves to Subscription Pricing\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Untitled%25203-1611674334803.png)\nTapbots, the maker of Tweetbot, has released [version 6 of the app](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834?mt=8), introducing a new subscription pricing model along with a handful of timeline and design updates.\n\nThe subscription costs $0.99 per month or $5.99 annually. Many of the features previously available as part of the paid app, including multiple account support, advanced filtering, and push notifications, are now subscription-only features. Tapbots says that subscribers will also benefit from future updates as Twitter expands its third-party APIs and ensure Tweetbot’s continued development. You can still download the app to view your timeline if you’re not willing to subscribe, but the free version is read-only, so it isn’t possible to tweet from it.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Image%252018-1611674334780.png)\nTweetbot 6 includes new icons, themes, and other Settings updates. \n\nAside from the new pricing model, Tweetbot 6 has only implemented a handful of new features, including a few changes to the timeline view and some design changes. In the main timeline, you’ll notice more image thumbnails than before. Polls and cards are also visible thanks to the implementation of Twitter’s latest third-party APIs, and there are new dedicated ‘@’ and ‘#’ buttons in the app’s tweet composition sheet.\n\nTweetbot 6 has implemented changes to the app’s settings too:\n\n* There are three new alternative app icons: Future, Future Noir, and Future Metal, which bear a close resemblance to the Modern versions of the icon\n* There are more and different UI themes, including four light versions and five dark versions where previously there were five total\n* Dark mode has been extended to the app’s Settings screens\n* Chrome and Firefox have been added as browser options for opening links\n* Service options for URL shortening, image uploads, and video uploads have been eliminated\n\nThe move to subscriptions isn’t easy. No matter how well it is handled, the change upsets a segment of users who aren’t willing to sign up. However, in the long run, a successful transition to subscriptions makes up for lost users with recurring revenue, which I’m sure an experienced development team like Tapbots has considered.\n\nI have no issue with subscriptions conceptually, but they rightly carry the expectation that in return for regular payments, users will receive meaningful, periodic updates. Recognizing this, many developers time the move to a subscription with a substantial app update to start off on the right foot, which Tapbots hasn’t done. Tweetbot’s subscription is primarily based on the promise of future updates. Even though the Tweetbot subscription isn’t expensive, I think Tapbots owes its users more than it has delivered. It’s a shame because Tweetbot remains one of the premier third-party Twitter clients for iOS. Hopefully, the lack of new features in this update will be addressed in subsequent releases.\n\nTweetbot [is available as a free download on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834?mt=8), but a subscription is necessary to send tweets and access other features.\n\n[Tweetbot 6 Moves to Subscription Pricing](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing\/)\n\n# Calcbot: A Beautiful New Take on Calculators - For iPhone & iPad\n\n**[Tapbots](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/)** are well known for making incredible applications: they look incredible, they’re incredibly useful. **[Pastebot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/pastebot\/)** is one of my most used iPhone apps, and the recent Retina Display update made it even better. Convertbot makes converting units fun and simple. Weightbot - I wish I’ll be able to use it someday. Thing is, no one gets custom UIs as right as Mark Jardine does. Period.\n\nThere was so much hype about Tapbots’ new projects. This review is not about **[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/business\/say-hello-to-tweetbot)**, and I guess we’ll have to wait for their much-requested Twitter client for a while. The folks over at Tapbots have just released a brand new application for iPhone and iPad, and before you hold your breath for something incredibly complex and game-changing - **[Calcbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/calcbot\/#overview)** is a “just” a simple calculator.\n\nBut it’s the best calculator app I’ve ever had on my iPhone. And iPad. And it’s not sitting on both my home screens.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Calcbot%2520-%2520Main.png)\nSee, the default calculator app from Apple is good. It does what it has to do, it looks decent - there’s nothing wrong about it. Could it be better? Of course. Many developers tried and released their alternative apps for calculations on the go, some absolutely easy to use, some tremendously complex and geared towards a very specific audience. **[Calcbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/calcbot\/#overview)** is simple, beautiful and, most of all, is intelligent.\n\nThe features that make Ctalcbot stand out are the following: universal for iPhone & iPad, beautifully designed UI, ergonomically arranged keyboard, live-as-you-type expression view, history tape. All of these features are cleverly implemented in a rather small screen (iPhone) and laid out on the much bigger iPad display.\n\nI don’t need to do complex operations on my iPhone calculator. But, I’ve always wanted to remember what I did before the current operation, and Calcbot does it perfectly. Thanks to the history tape, you can take a look at all your previous calculations and, by **[tapping on them](http:\/\/c0839932.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com\/Calcbot%20-%20Tape%20Menu.png)**, use them again as a result, use the expressions, copy them or send them by email. You can also send the whole tape by email or just clear it. You can access the history tape by swiping down on the calculator display (iPhone version) or put the iPad in landscape mode.\n\nThe iPad UI is amazing, the graphics Jardine designed for Calcbot are **[state of the art on the tablet](http:\/\/c0839932.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com\/Calcbot%20-%20iPad%20Portrait.png)**. I really haven’t seen a calculator looking this beautiful.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, Calcbot supports advanced calculations like sin, cos, tan, too.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Calcbot%2520-%2520Tape.png)\nIt’s not only about design though. Sure it helps, but it’s not everything. The keyboard layout is “ergonomic” and intuitive, the history tape helps a lot in retrieving calculations. But the killer feature for me is the live expression view: on other calculator apps (and Apple’s default one, too) I’m not given the option to see what keys I’ve pressed. Thanks to Calcbot’s live view, I can. I’ve been using the app for some days now and I found it to perfectly fit in my workflow: open it up, do some calculations, see what you pressed, retrieve calculations from the tape. I haven’t used the email feature yet, but I have the feeling it’ll come in handy when I’ll need to send the summary of some expenses to my friends or colleagues.\n\nAvailable on the **[App Store at $0.99](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=Fu2a2g8N61Q&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewSoftware%253Fid%253D376694347%2526mt%253D8%2526partnerId%253D30&amp;u1=www.google.com)** (on sale for a limited time), you can’t miss Calcbot. It’s the best calculator app for iPhone and iPad. Your devices want it.\n\n**UPDATE**: You can also spread some Calcbot love on Facebook on get Socialite for free thanks to **[Macheist’s partnership with Tapbots](http:\/\/www.macheist.com\/calcbot)**.\n\n[Thanks, Akira]\n\n[Calcbot: A Beautiful New Take on Calculators - For iPhone & iPad](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/calcbot-review\/)\n\n# Pastebot 1.4 Adds Clipboard In The Background - Kinda\n\n[Pastebot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/pastebot\/), the excellent clipboard \/ data management utility from  [Tapbots](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/), has just been updated to version 1.4 which, among other things, adds support for the much requested clipboard in the background. How that works, however, is a little different from what the developers originally had in mind.\n\nDue to Apple’s restrictions when it come to persistent processes running in the background, the app can’t keep on recording all the items you copy for an unlimited period of time: just like iOS 4’s APIs allow, background expiration is set to around 10 minutes. After that you’ll get a notification letting you know that the background process needs to be restarted by launching the app again. The local notification idea is great, and luckily enough is completely optional.\n\nThe developers [originally came up with the idea](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/iphone\/pastebot-clipboard-savvy-music-syncing\/) of making Pastebot run in the background on top of a silent music track (audio can always run in the background on iOS), but Apple rejected that implementation.\n\nPastebot 1.4 also adds a useful “send as text” feature for items in the clipboard (requires iOS 4), single tap for images in fullscreen, lots of bug fixes.\n\nWith its interoperability with the Mac and the new and improved features, Pastebot continues to be a must-have for any iPhone user. In case you don’t know, Tapbots also make beautiful apps - your eyes won’t regret the purchase. Which, by the way, is [just $3.99 in the App Store](http:\/\/ticci.me\/2vYg).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Pastebot%25201.4%2520-%25201.jpg)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&Pastebot%25201.4%2520-%25202.jpg)\n\n[Pastebot 1.4 Adds Clipboard In The Background - Kinda](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/iphone\/pastebot-1-4-adds-clipboard-in-the-background-kinda\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.1 Released: Landscape Mode, CloudApp, Fixes\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&22827_PTM_343_1000000714.png)\nIf you read my original [Tweetbot for iPhone review](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), you know it’s a great Twitter client I’m in love with. Over the past weeks I had the chance to try out an early version of Tweetbot 1.1, [released today in the App Store](http:\/\/cl.ly\/5zY6), and once again Tapbots has managed to fit so many features into the app it’d be hard at this point to think of anything that didn’t find its way into Tweetbot. Version 1.1 introduces the much requested support for landscape mode, but there’s a catch: considering the portrait nature of the iPhone, landscape only works in three sections: compose window, for those who like to type with a larger keyboard; media, to view photos in landscape; web, to have a broader view of web pages. It makes sense to not offer landscape support in the timeline – you’d have to give up on viewing a certain amount of tweets in horizontal orientation, plus, let’s face it, it would just look weird. So landscape it is, but only for some sections of the app.\n\nTweetbot 1.1 is also rich in additions to the main experience. The app’s got new user and hashtag buttons added to the compose screen, to make it easier to include people of specific keywords in a tweet. The hashtag picker has been improved as well, if you’re into following Twitter trends, or have a set of tags you use often. More importantly, photos and videos can now be uploaded to CloudApp, meaning the service is not only being used for URL shortening anymore. In the timeline, Tapbots has fixed the location stuff to display more accurate locations and moved the “tweet gap” bar above old tweets, instead of below. I’m not sure I like the new gap bar better, but perhaps it’ll keep growing on me over the next weeks.\n\nOverall, Tweetbot 1.1 builds on the excellent foundation of version 1.0 to deliver a powerful Twitter client that’s heavily based on Tapbots’ custom style, but it’s accessible for anyone who’s never used a Tapbots app before. The app is propagating now in the App Store, so check for updates in iTunes in a few minutes if it isn’t out for you yet.\n\n[Tweetbot 1.1 Released: Landscape Mode, CloudApp, Fixes](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-1-released-landscape-mode-cloudapp-fixes\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 1.2 Released With Several Enhancements\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&23900_Photo-09-6-11-19-13-53.jpg)\nTweetbot, the Twitter client from Tapbots we reviewed [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), has been updated to version 1.2, adding several features requested by users in the past weeks and fixing some of the minor gripes we had with the application when it first came out. Whilst version 1.1  [focused on adding CloudApp](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-1-released-landscape-mode-cloudapp-fixes\/) and landscape support, Tweetbot 1.2 brings a series of refinements and enhancements across all the sections of the client that should dramatically improve the experience. For example, you can now undo retweets, and retweet from another account if you hold down the retweet button. That’s quite handy: not only you can delete accidental retweets, you can also retweet quickly without constantly switching between accounts. And if you don’t like Twitter’s standard retweets, Tweetbot 1.2 has an option to send old “quote style” retweets.\n\nTweetbot 1.2 introduces absolute and relative timestamps, Google\/Instapaper Mobilizer support for when you need to strip away all the clutter from a webpage and read it in a text-only view, as well as integration with Bitly.Pro for those who keep a custom domain on the popular link shortening service. Besides the new great user & hashtag picker from the compose view (make sure to check out the animations), short link geeks should be happy to know Tweetbot 1.2 has support for custom API endpoints. Other features in this update include:\n\n* Pinboard support in the read later options\n* Pikchur image upload support\n* Tapping on a success\/failure message dismisses it instantly\n* Added @username\/listname for followed lists\n\nTweetbot 1.2 is [available now at $1.99 on the App Store](http:\/\/cl.ly\/5zY6).\n\n[Tweetbot 1.2 Released With Several Enhancements](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-2-released-with-several-enhancements\/)\n\n# Tapbots Release First Ever\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&27591_Tweetbotsale.jpg)\n[Tapbots](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/), creators of awesome iPhone apps such as Calcbot, Weightbot, Pastebot, and Convertbot have decided to promote their fantastic twitter client by having a limited time sale of [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/).

You keep working on it, trying to look at your product from as many perspectives as possible. If you believe in it, you can make something great an even *greater* product. Last year, [I reviewed Tweetbot 1.0 for iPhone](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/), the Twitter client many of us had been impatiently waiting for:\n\n> Tweetbot is the app I’ve been waiting for: an excellent innovator of the Twitter platform. My new favorite Twitter client.  \n\n> Tweetbot is everything I’ve ever wanted from a Twitter app: it looks great, it’s fast on WiFi and 3G, it innovates in several aspects that have been regarded as “standards” from both users and developers for too long. Could Tweetbot be any better? Maybe. The developers could work on improving the speed of animations and refresh times as much as possible, or implement support for Readability and other URL shortening services. But as far as the Twitter experience goes, Tweetbot has got everything I’m looking for.  \n\nI have tried many Twitter apps in the past years, as [you may know](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/new-twitter-clients\/), and I’ve never seen a third-party developer as committed to making their client *great* as Tapbots did with [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/). Iteration. Tapbots listened to feedback, and managed to pull the old trick of implementing features without turning your original vision into a piece a software it wasn’t meant to be. With [version 2.0 of Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), Tapbots has improved almost every aspect of the original experience, adding features, bug fixes, and refinements that still make Tweetbot the finest Twitter client available on the iPhone. Now faster, smoother, and more intuitive.\n\nAnd it’s not like we didn’t see [Tweetbot 2.0](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) coming. In the past nine months, Tapbots has brought Tweetbot from a fantastic 1.0 release to a state-of-the-art Twitter app capable of suiting all kinds of needs when interacting with Twitter in short burst of tweets, or longer sessions aimed at catching up with hours worth of timeline updates. Let’s look back at Tweetbot’s history:\n\n* Tweetbot 1.1  [brings](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-1-released-landscape-mode-cloudapp-fixes\/) landscape mode.\n* Tweetbot 1.2  [is released](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-2-released-with-several-enhancements\/) with several enhancements all around the app.\n* Tweetbot 1.3  [has new features](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-3-released-with-new-features-favstar-support\/) including Favstar support.\n* Push notifications [are added](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-initial-push-notification-support\/) natively to Tweetbot, and they are fantastic.\n* Tweetbot 1.5  [gets](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-5\/) muting features.\n* Tweetbot 1.6  [syncs](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync\/) with other Twitter clients using Tweet Marker.\n* Tweetbot is one of the first clients to [get native Twitter integration](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-ios-5-twitter-integration-with-single-sign-on\/) in iOS 5.\n\nAs you can see, Tapbots didn’t rest on its laurels, deciding to keep on building on the app’s momentum to deliver *the* Twitter client that could appeal to both power users and less tech-savvy citizens of the Twitterverse. I have already explained why Tweetbot is my Twitter client of choice: if anything, I’d like Tweetbot to take over the entire ecosystem to offer an integrated experience consistent across platforms.\n\nIt would be easy to look at Tweetbot 2.0 and say it’s everything Tweetbot 1.0 should have been without considering the various milestones and updates that brought us to this release. Think of Tweetbot 2.0 as a natural evolution of Tweetbot, rather than just a collection of features that didn’t make it in version 1.0. Tweetbot 2.0 is the culmination of nine months of fine-tuning.\n\nThe biggest change in Tweetbot 2.0 is the timeline. What used to require two taps now needs only one, and the way retweets are displayed has been improved to increase interaction and overall navigation between original posters and retweeters. In Tweetbot 1.x, opening a @username or http:\/\/ link from a tweet in the timeline required a double-tap (or an initial tap to “expand” the tweet and reveal the tweet drawer), then a second one to tap on usernames and links. In Tweetbot 2.0, you can directly single-tap on links and usernames (which are a bit bolder than other words) without opening the drawer; you can always reveal more options by tapping somewhere else on the tweet, but this time single taps on usernames and links will open a user’s profile view or a web view, respectively. Similarly, single-tapping on profile pics in the timeline will take you to the profile view, whereas in Tweetbot 1.x this action would open the tweet drawer. Without sacrificing performances in any way (actually, Tweetbot 2.0 with its new tap actions and timeline UI feels faster than Tweetbot 1.x on my iPhone 4S – both in terms of scrolling, swiping, and image caching), Tweetbot’s improved tap behavior is more than a welcome change – it’s a terrific improvement over the previous version’s navigation system.\n\nLinks and usernames aren’t the only things you can now tap on – retweets, displayed natively in Tweetbot, have been redesigned to allow users to tap and tap & hold on the name of the user that retweeted a status update; furthermore, the entire retweet UI has been tweaked to integrate the “Retweeted by …” indicator inside the message cell – take a look the screenshot below for comparison. If the people you follow often retweet stuff, this is another great improvement as it enables you to easily check the user who retweeted something you like.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&iPhone-1.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&iphone-2.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&iphone-newbar.png)\nAs you scroll Tweetbot’s new timeline, you’ll notice that another addition has found its way in this update: image thumbnails. How many times have you looked at Instagram links (or any picture link) and wondered if it’d be appropriate to open it, or if you’d be interested in it? Fear no more, as Tweetbot now displays thumbnails inline and allows you to tap on them to jump straight to the image viewer in full-screen. The image viewer itself is the same of Tweetbot 1.0; by tapping & holding the thumbnail, however, you’re given some handy options such as Send to Instapaper (which becomes Pinboard or Read It Later depending on the service you’ve configured in Settings), Tweet URL, Open in Safari, Copy URL, and Email URL. Even with thumbnails, scrolling in Tweetbot’s new timeline is smooth and fast.\n\nBut there’s more. Remember the “new tweets bar” from the original Tweetbot, the blue stripe that let you know how many new tweets you had in your timeline and loaded differently depending on gap behavior? It’s gone. Instead, Tweetbot 2.0 features a new beautiful translucent tweets bar that works the same for gap loading (admittedly, still the best implementation on any iOS Twitter client) but that you can also hide on scroll or make persistent as you swipe down to reach the top of your timeline. Why is the new tweets bar useful? It provides a nice-looking and unobtrusive way of knowing how many tweets you still have to read – at least for me, this is **very** useful when I’m opening Twitter after hours of inactivity.\n\nAnd then there are a lot of little changes and minor fixes. Overall performance, as I said, has been improved, making Tweetbot faster than ever and smoother in any kind of animation. Perhaps this will convince those who said Tweetbot was “heavy” that it’s worth trying the app again. Even when the new tweets bar isn’t hidden, you can tap on it to dismiss it. You can tap & hold on the gear icon in the tweet drawer to reveal two extra actions: Post Link to Tweet and View in Favstar, with Copy Link to Tweet now assigned to a single tap on the gear icon. Links in users’ profiles are tappable and the visual Tweet Marker indicator is now always visible regardless of whether you’ve activated the service or not (obviously, you’ll have to turn it on to sync to other clients).\n\nI can go on with changes and enhancements. Direct Messages have been completely redesigned to load faster and have conversations displayed from top to bottom as in Messages.app. To reply to a DM in a conversation, Tapbots has brought a Messages-like text entry field to the DM view, which now also happens to refresh every 5 minutes as part of the timed auto-refresh feature that also works for Timeline and Mentions. In Tweetbot 2.0, when a DM fails the app will make it red, allowing you to tap on it to resend or delete. Readability has been added as a mobilizer service, and there is now a toggle in every web view to instantly switch between full site and mobilized view. I love this feature (but I use Instapaper for that). Oh, and *one more thing*: don’t forget Tweetbot supports a variety of URL schemes, [more than you know](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme), and they work very well with [Launch Center](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/launch-center-1-2-gets-all-new-app-detection\/).\n\n[Tweetbot 1.0](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) was packed with [features](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/tweetbot\/tweetbot-2-0-for-iphone), proving that Tapbots could make their distinctive style work in the saturated market of Twitter clients. Updates to Tweetbot 1.0 built on the original vision, adding new powerful features and interactions that allowed Tapbots to reach an even larger audience, especially since the addition of native push notifications. Tweetbot 2.0 accomplishes the difficult goal of dramatically enhancing Tweetbot 1.0 while keeping everything familiar and accessible, proving that Tapbots can still make the best Twitter client around.\n\nTweetbot 2.0 is [now available on the App Store at $2.99](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n[Tweetbot 2.0 Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-0-review\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for iPad Review\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-1.png)\nSince its release two years ago, the iPad has always needed a better Twitter client. [Tweetbot for iPad](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/ipad\/) is the better Twitter app I have been waiting for, and it sets a new standard that future Twitter clients will have to be compared with.\n\nFrom a Twitter power user’s perspective, the iPad came at an interesting point in the history of the platform. Twitter clients for iPhone and Mac had reached a kind of maturity and complexity that enabled users like me to demand a certain grade of efficiency from new Twitter apps for the tablet; Twitter itself was beefing up its first-party app portfolio with acquisitions and a fresh strategy based on making the official clients the go-to apps for the average Twitter user. Some notable Twitter clients came out on the iPad throughout 2010, including the excellent Twitterrific, which  [we have reviewed](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/twitterrific\/) several times on MacStories.\n\nIn 2010, Twitter also released its very own application for the iPad; developed by Loren Brichter, the man behind Tweetie, Twitter for iPad launched to a (still ongoing) controversy as to whether iPad interfaces should adopt more courageous designs in displaying information and sections to the user. Taking the best features of Twitter for iPhone (fluidity, clean design, pull to refresh) and mixing them up with  [new interaction schemes](http:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2010\/09\/twitter-for-ipad-sharing-content-in.html) such as panels and pinch gestures, Twitter for iPad collected rave reviews and considerable disapprovals because of its interesting use of classic Twitter elements (vertical timeline, separate section for Mentions) alongside a new model for driving users’ taps around the app in the form of sliding panels, modal menus, and popovers. You can read more about it in  [my original review](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ipad\/twitter-for-ipad-review\/) from 2010.\n\nThe problem with Twitter for iPad, I believe, is that it failed to appeal power users in the long term, stalling on the same feature set it had at launch without adding substantial improvement over what could have been a fantastic application. I, for one, used the official Twitter iPad app for months, but then I came at a point where I couldn’t stand seeing decent third-party apps staying on top of new Twitter functionalities and “unofficial” services, and Twitter’s own app left behind with Brichter [gone](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/11\/04\/loren-brichter-creator-of-official-twitter-apps-for-mac-and-iphone-leaves-twitter\/) and seemingly no interest from Twitter’s mobile team in keeping it up to date – fixing the bugs and annoyances that were reported on day one. Some  [improvements](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-updates-ios-app-with-ipad-2-camera-support-more-bug-fixes\/) and  [new features](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-updates-ios-app-with-ios-5-twitter-integration-new-ipad-dm-interface\/) eventually found their way to the app, and word is that we are waiting for a major 4.0 redesign of the client which, I believe, will put the app on par with the disastrous  [iPhone version](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/review-twitter-4-0-for-iphone\/). Tweetbot for iPad thus arrives in a landscape with no clear leader, but with some very good apps that have caught the attention of both power and average users in the past two years.\n\nI wrote about this  [before](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/new-twitter-clients\/). I wish third-party developers would accept Tweetbot as the de-facto app for power users and move on to innovate on other areas of the service. I’m biased: I love Tweetbot, I use it every day on the iPhone, and I couldn’t wait for an iPad version to be released. Today is kind of a dream come true for a Twitter nerd, but the question is – was it worth the wait? Not just good – is Tweetbot the  *great* app the iPad was waiting for? Let’s dive in.\n\nLong story short: yes, it is. Tweetbot for iPad is an amazingly advanced and full-featured Twitter client that, in spite of its 1.0 version number, already sports a series of features most apps don’t have. It’s got Tapbots’ distinctive design style applied to every aspect of the interface, and whilst some may quickly dismiss it as a non-native, Android-like look, I think it’s beautiful. More importantly, Tweetbot comes to the iPad not to single-handedly reinvent Twitter clients and the entire Twitter ecosystem, but to provide a delightful experience optimized for the bigger screen.\n\nThat’s not to say Tweetbot for iPad is a blown-up version of its iPhone counterpart – you’d be mistaken in thinking Tapbots simply took Tweetbot for iPhone and made its graphics bigger to fit the iPad. The two Tweetbots look similar to each other – some of interface elements are used consistently across both devices – but the experience offered by Tweetbot for iPad is uniquely built for a device that’s swiped, touched, and held in a different way than an iPhone.\n\nThose who use Tweetbot for iPhone will be instantly familiar with Tweetbot for iPad. In fact, I don’t think it’s necessary to go through the feature set of the app again as Tapbots managed to incorporate the same functionalities across the two platforms very cleverly:  *what* the app does is the same,  *how* it does it is different. I want to focus on how Tweetbot for iPad takes advantage of the features built by Tapbots to deliver the best Twitter experience on the iPad yet, rather than explain once again how you can turn a list into a timeline, or  [iOS 5 Twitter integration](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-5-twitter-integration\/). From a feature checklist standpoint, Tweetbot for iPad bears great resemblance to Tweetbot 2.0 for iPhone, which we have reviewed earlier today.\n\n## The Timeline\n\nLike Twitterrific for iPad, Tweetbot takes a simple approach at displaying your Twitter timeline on the tablet’s bigger screen. Rather than trying to break taps on usernames, mentions, or links into multiple panels that some users might find distracting, Tweetbot presents a clean, full-screen timeline design that can fit more status updates than an iPhone at once, and doesn’t try to revolutionize the concept of vertically scrolling a list of messages and clicking on links. There are tabs for the various sections of Twitter – including some new stuff that Tapbots has prepared for this new Tweetbot release – but no panels for the actual interaction with content, meaning that tweet details, webpages, and conversations will load in full-screen in a single window, not a panel sliding into view. And here’s where Tweetbot for iPad reveals one of its little design touches that manages to greatly enhance usability: because the iPad’s screen is so big, forcing users to tap on a tiny Back button to load a previous level of navigation can be cumbersome.\n\nTo solve the problem of a bigger screen with tiny navigation buttons, Tweetbot for iPad implements “smart gestures” in the same way that the iPhone version allows you to quickly load replies and conversations with a quick swipe, only adding new actions for going back one level or to the “root” of a section, such as your Mentions. Typically, when I’m sitting down with my iPad and fire up Twitter I like to explore around, engage in conversations and look up other people’s tweets. It’s not like I’m always in my timeline: I might open a link or two, load a conversation and follow a user’s profile from there – “nested views”, as they should be properly called, are frequent and they must be considered carefully from a usability standpoint as the app should always provide the user with an easily understable way to go back. Tweetbot for iPad offers three: the Back button, tabs, and swipe gestures. Let’s say you’ve opened a conversation from your timeline, a user’s profile from that conversation (double-tap on avatar), and another conversation from the profile (swipe on a reply). Now, it’s likely that you’ll want to go back to Point A (your main timeline), or Point B (the conversation). Tweetbot offers a two-finger swipe gesture to go back one level, and three-finger swipe to go back to root. These gestures work amazingly well in any context, and they performed fluidly on my iPad 2 in any possible scenario.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0474.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0466.png)\nOf course, you can also use the aforementioned tabs and Back button to navigate if you don’t feel comfortable with gestures: whilst simply tapping Back will “go back” one level, a tap & hold on the same button will go back to the root of a view; similarly, tapping a tab in the sidebar – whether it’s in portrait or landscape mode – will always go back to the root. Tweetbot for iPad introduces a new option in Navigation settings that lets you hide tabs you don’t want, so make sure to keep the ones you think you’re going to use as a way to navigate back in the timeline. As for URLs: they open in full-screen mode à la Twitterrific and feature the same options seen in Tweetbot 2.0 for iPhone, new mobilizer command included (plus, they are colored and single-tappable).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0465.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0464.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0463.png)\nFrom a web view, you can take a look at Tapbots’ custom popover menu design by tapping on the Sharing button in the upper right corner.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&timelines.png)\n*Timelines: Tweetbot for iPad (right) offers font size controls and bigger profile pictures than Twitter for iPad (left).*\n\n## Gestures\n\nBecause the iPad’s screen is so big compared to an iPhone, some areas of Tweetbot might appear to be “wasting space” when there’s nothing left to load – for instance, a conversation of only two tweets won’t even fill half of the screen in portrait mode. In testing the Tweetbot beta, I initially didn’t appreciate the choice of loading short conversations in their own dedicated view, because the rest of the window looked empty; with time though, I have developed a habit of using this empty space as a gesture area for navigation – it almost seems meant to be used that way. Otherwise, I don’t have a problem with Tweetbot using the same timeline design of the iPhone app as long as more tweets are displayed – reinventing the wheel (in this case, the timeline design) is not necessary when you just want to focus on reading status updates.\n\nTouch interaction is a distinctive trait of Tweetbot, and I’m glad Paul and Mark have kept gestures consistent across the iPhone and iPad. I’ve already mentioned swipes; here’s what you can do with taps:\n\n* Tap a tweet to open the tweet drawer;\n* Double-tap a tweet to open the Detail view;\n* Tap a user’s profile pic to open the Profile view;\n* Tap usernames to open Profile view, tap links to open Web view;\n* Tap & hold a link (or inline picture\/link in user’s Bio) to: Bookmark, Tweet URL, Open in Safari, Copy URL, or Email URL;\n* Tap & hold a tweet to: Bookmark, Copy Link to Tweet, Copy Tweet, Email Tweet, or Translate;\n* Tap & hold retweet button to retweet from a different account;\n* Tap & hold favorite button to Award Tweet of the Day;\n* Tap Actions button to: Copy Link to Tweet, Copy Tweet, Email Tweet, or Translate;\n* Tap & hold Actions button to: Post Link to Tweet, or View in Favstar;\n* Tap & hold a profile pic (or username\/retweet author) to: Public Reply, Manage List Memberships, Mute, Follow\/Unfollow;\n* Double-tap a tab to scroll to the top;\n* Double-tap Messages tab to Mark All Messages as Read;\n* Tap & hold an image to: Save Image, Copy Image, View Website, or Tweet Link;\n* Tap & hold hashtag to: New Post with Hashtag, or Mute;\n* Tap & hold the “via…” client link in Detail view to mute a specific Twitter client;\n* Tap the location button when composing a new tweet to Remove Location, Use Coordinates, select a Point of Interest, or choose a Location;\n* Double-tap the Profile tab to open a user’s Favstar page for recent tweets;\n* Last, you can configure triple-taps in Settings for: Reply, Retweet, Favorite, Translate, or View in Favstar.\n\nSupport for gestures, tap actions, and a variety of different web services is essentially the reason why Tweetbot is so highly regarded as an app for power users; Tweetbot for iPad doesn’t disappoint with a large selection of preferences and services to adjust and activate in the Settings. As on the iPhone, these options include Pinboard and Instapaper integration, support for upload services such as CloudApp and Moby, and mobilizer tools like Google and Readability. I particularly like how Tapbots figured out a way to implement  *a lot* of settings and gestures without overwhelming the user experience. Going through all my settings for a newly added account takes only a couple of minutes (you’ll find some new options in Tweetbot 2.0 and Tweetbot for iPad, like a switch to make the new tweets bar persistent or invisible on scroll), and the Welcome screen should get you up to speed on the most important gestures in no time.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0459.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0477.png)\nI should also note that a kind of gesture Twitter for iPad implemented directly on the timeline,  [pinch to reveal tweet](http:\/\/c0839932.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com\/Twitter%20for%20iPad%20-%20Pinch.png), is nowhere to be seen in Tweetbot, with Tapbots opting for more intuitive taps and swipes throughout the whole app. I think it’s a good choice.\n\n## Everything Else\n\nTweetbot is the best Twitter client I’ve ever used on the iPad for a number of reasons. I’ve already mentioned gestures, user interface design, and integration with many different services I use on a daily basis. Next on the list would certainly be fluidity and timeline gaps – two aspects I expect to find fully functional and stable in the Twitter client I want to use every day. In spite of its custom UI, I didn’t find Tweetbot for iPad to be “heavy”. Whilst some people are firmly convinced Tweetbot is a “heavy app”, I think such purported “heaviness” can be subjective in terms of visual appearance, because as far as the engine that powers scrolling and animations goes, Tweetbot is extremely snappy and fluid both on my iPhone 4S and iPad 2. The beefy A5 processor certainly helps in getting views to load quickly and a timeline with hundreds of tweets to scroll fast, and I’ll admit I haven’t tested Tweetbot on the original iPad, but I’m also fairly certain a lot of optimization was done on Tapbots’ side to make sure Tweetbot’s custom graphics wouldn’t interfere in any way with the UX.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&timeline.png)\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&tweetbot-ipad-IMG_0456.png)\nMy coworkers often make fun of me because I’m always on Twitter. As  [I have written elsewhere](http:\/\/ticci.org\/40000.html), Twitter has become more than a simple social network for me – it’s a *people* network that helps me connect with amazing individuals for work, discussion, or pure leisure. You see, I  **need** a Twitter client that’s capable of loading several hours of tweets with hundreds of status updates when I wake up. I need it to be fast at fetching these updates and stable at scrolling through them as I catch up with the news; I need it to be able to go back even 20 hours if I need to read older articles, and I want it to feature state-of-the-art timeline gap detection that picks up right where I left off, no matter how far in the timeline it is. Fortunately, Tweetbot nears perfection with its implementation of timeline gap that puts the competition to shame when it comes to loading past tweets while maintaining your previous position in the timeline intact. Twitter and Twitterrific never quite got gap detection rigt, and I’m glad this functionality of Tweetbot for iPhone has been ported over to the iPad. With the new tweets bar (which is dark gray on iPad), you also have a nice way to see how manu unread tweets you have  *while scrolling*.\n\nAs I said above, Tweetbot for iPad shares the same UI principles and feature set of Tweetbot for iPhone, but there are many things that are unique to it, especially in the interface design department, given the different screen real estate Tapbots had to work around. Several views aren’t simply bigger, as the timeline could suggest, they are  *different*.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&IMG_0484.png)\nTake the user profile view for example: rather than placing a single user’s stream in a tab separate from the profile page, Tapbots is integrating tweets directly below the profile with a tabbed interface. In the upper section of the view, you can check out various information such as following and followers count, bio, web link, and other data. There’s also a Follow button in the upper right corner, and the usual action icon will let you message people, mute them, or add them to a list. The profile view opens with the Tweets tab directly selected, so you’ll see a portion of a user’s tweets below the initial user info box. But as you scroll these tweets, the tabs will snap back to the top of the timeline so they will “stick” as you scroll, allowing you to easily switch between Tweets, Mentions, Favorites, and Lists. The effect is really neat, helps saving taps and precious interface space, and you should see it in action. As with the iPhone app, Tweetbot for iPad has solid list support with creation, management and deleting features built-in. You can create new lists on-device, manage users inside those lists, and subscribe to other people’s lists without leaving the app. And of course, you can make a list Tweetbot’s main timeline, which is another characteristic feature of the app iPhone users will immediately recognize.\n\n[Tweet Marker](http:\/\/tweetmarker.net\/) support, which was initially added to Tweetbot for iPhone, plays a big role in this iPad version if you own multiple iOS devices running Tweetbot, or a Mac with a Twitter client that has Tweet Marker sync. Now, the timeline position that the service saved from your iPhone’s Tweetbot will be pushed to the iPad automatically (if you activate Tweet Marker) every time you launch the app. I have tested Tweet Marker pretty heavily (I use it every day), and Tapbots’ implementation is flawless: getting the last synced position takes less than a second, and the app is capable of automatically scrolling to the last tweet you saw or mention you were about to reply to. We have covered Tweet Marker support in Tweetbot [before](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync\/), and those who were waiting for cross iPad-iPhone compatibility in Tweetbot to start using Manton Reece’s service finally have a reason to.\n\nI should probably mention that one of the things Twitter for iPad did exceptionally well in my opinion was letting you load links in a separate panel and scroll the timeline at the same time. That was one of the most controversial features of Loren Brichter’s app (animations weren’t 100% smooth and the web panel could be lost by simply switching tabs), and I liked it a lot. Tweetbot doesn’t take the crazy-innovative approach of Twitter for iPad, but I haven’t found the absence of panel-based link opening to be a problem in daily usage. I did notice, though, that I’ve been marking a lot of tweets as Favorites lately, but I’m not sure that’s related to Tweetbot.\n\nTypically, I’d mention that a new app I am reviewing is pretty great, but has some flaws in its first version – which is completely normal. With Tweetbot, however, I tried to come up with things I didn’t like in my three week period of testing – which involved several days of using only an iPad and hours spent on Twitter – but couldn’t. Honestly, there’s nothing “I don’t like” about Tweetbot, just a few things I wish 1.0 already had, and that perhaps are coming in the future. Personally, I would like to finally be able to use both Pinboard and Instapaper as bookmarking services at once, and have some kind of Evernote integration for saving tweets and links. I also think it’d be neat to have real-time streaming for tweets, iCloud sync for settings, and an option to add tweets to  [Storify](http:\/\/storify.com\/) – even though I understand the latter may be asking  *too much*. Like I said: I’m very happy with the workflow Tweetbot enables and I never found myself wishing a feature had been implemented differently.\n\n## New Twitter Clients\n\nIn my  [New Twitter Clients](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/new-twitter-clients\/) piece, I wrote:\n\n> So here’s another possible scenario. Let’s continue to diversify the offer of available Twitter clients, and settle with one app for power users. Justin doesn’t like Tweetbot, but perhaps one year from now Tweetbot will be available on more platforms with changes and tweaks that everyone will like and use on a daily basis, even Justin. Around that Twitter client for power users, I imagine a flourishing ecosystem of innovative Twitter apps that don’t simply focus on building an alternative to Tweetbot — a daunting task at this point — but provide a unique experience that can live alongside the main, full-featured client.  \n\nI’ve been using [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/ipad\/) on my iPad for three weeks now, and it’s good. More than good, it’s the  *great* Twitter client power users and those who simply didn’t like the alternatives out there were waiting for. Tweetbot doesn’t reinvent the genre and will look fairly familiar to those coming from the iPhone app; Tapbots brought the iPhone version’s highly engaging experience and powerful features to the iPad, fine-tuning the interface and interaction for the bigger screen in the process. You have to despise Tapbots’ style to not like this app, as anyone who’s been around long enough in the industry can tell that, as a Twitter client, Tweetbot is an amazing achievement for its developers, and the third-party community as whole, which has now a new standard to be compared to.\n\nTweetbot for iPad is [available today at $2.99 on the App Store](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-twitter-client-personality%252Fid498801050%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\n- [Tapbots website](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/ipad\/)\n\n- [Promo video](http:\/\/c200349.r49.cf1.rackcdn.com\/tweetbotipad_iphone.m4v)\n\n[Tweetbot for iPad Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/)\n\n# Netbot 1.1 Adds Push Notifications, Search\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&31725_2012-10-29_164435-post-1.jpg)\n[Netbot](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/netbot-tweetbot-reborn-for-app-net\/), [Tapbots’ iOS client for App.net](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/netbot\/), has been updated today to version 1.1, which adds two of the most requested features from the app’s userbase: push notifications and search.\n\nBoth features have been created by Tapbots’ developer Paul Haddad on top of [App.net’s streaming component of the API](http:\/\/devblog.app.net\/2012\/10\/16\/streaming-api-and-filtering\/). This means that, while Netbot isn’t streaming timelines like Tweetbot yet, it’ll be able to send you notifications for Mentions, Reposts, Stars, and new Follows. Once again, this works just like Tweetbot: head over your account’s Settings and select Notifications to choose which kind of information you’d like to receive. In my tests, Netbot’s push notifications were reliable and fast.\n\nSearch has been brought to Netbot as well. The implementation is very simple for now: just open the Search tab, enter a keyword, and you’ll be shown global posts containing that keyword. Due to the early nature of the App.net API, there are no fancy options such as search by location, trends, and so forth.\n\nA love-hate relationship for several Twitter\/App.net users, crossposts have been enhanced in Netbot 1.1. You can now crosspost quickly by hitting the standard Repost button on the post drawer; this will bring up a new option called “Repost to Twitter”. You can also choose which Twitter account to repost with if you’ve given Netbot access to your Twitter accounts.\n\nNetbot 1.1 doesn’t make the app more different from Tweetbot, but it’s a solid update that adds useful functionality for ADN users. Get it [from the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/netbot-for-app.net-iphone\/id563595132?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg)  ( [iPad version](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/netbot-for-app.net-ipad-edition\/id563596528?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg) ).\n\n[Netbot 1.1 Adds Push Notifications, Search](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/netbot-1-1-adds-push-notifications-search\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for Mac Review\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&31575_Screen-Shot-2012-10-18-at-6.17.23-AM.png)\nWhen the first alpha of Tweetbot for Mac [came out in July](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-mac-public-alpha-review\/), I said I would take a look at the app again. Here we are, three months later, with the [final version of Tweetbot for Mac available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?ls=1&amp;mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg).\n\nI concluded my review of the public alpha version with:\n\n> Right now, Tweetbot for Mac is, in my opinion, already superior to any other client for OS X — and it still can be improved. More importantly, Tweetbot makes better use of Twitter features than Twitter’s own Mac app, and that says a lot about the importance of third-party clients in this ecosystem.  \n\nIn calling the alpha version of Tweetbot a “superior” product, I took quite a stance. I had been using the alpha for weeks before the public release, and I had the perspective and context to make a conscious and reasonable decision about my statement. I knew I was going to like Tweetbot and use it on a daily basis. Three months later, that’s still the case.\n\nI’ll get to the point right away. Tweetbot is, in my opinion, the best Twitter client for Mac. From my perspective, no other app gets closer to the amount of polish and functionality that Tapbots poured into their latest creation, making it the most powerful, fast, and elegant Twitter app I’ve seen on OS X to date. In hindsight, it’s also a superior product than Twitter for Mac, which, as you may recall, [used](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/twitter-for-mac-review-love-it-hate-it-tweet-it\/) to be my go-to client. Three months ago I reviewed an app that I *knew* was going to be great.\n\nIn thinking about how I should approach this new review, I came to the conclusion that you don’t need me to go through the backstory of Twitter clients on the Mac. Here’s what I wrote, again, for context:\n\n> Ever since Loren Brichter (creator of the original Tweetie, who sold his app to Twitter and went on to work there) left the company, Twitter for Mac — what I had deemed as the best Twitter client for OS X — fell into an unexplainable state of abandon and lack of updates. You would think it’s in Twitter’s best interest to keep a native client up to date with the latest features of the service; and yet, after a solid first version — which came after years of speculation on Tweetie 2 — Twitter started ignoring the app, failing to bring several of Twitter’s new features (such as inline media and updated search) to the desktop. It only got worse recently: after many updates to Lion, Twitter for Mac has started showing new bugs and glitches that haven’t been fixed by Twitter, alongside the ones that have always been there and were never corrected. And then with the release of the Retina MacBook Pro, Twitter’s lack of support for high-res text and graphics became the proverbial final nail in the coffin of what used to be a great app.  \n\nTwitter for Mac still hasn’t received an update since last year. Some say it’s [no longer in development](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/09\/06\/reportedly-development-to-cease-for-twitters-mac-client\/).\n\nIn my review of Tweetbot Alpha, I briefly touched upon features that were missing from the app:\n\n> For instance, there is limited support for keyboard shortcuts, there are some rough edges around the interface, and one of my favorite features of Twitter for Mac — being able to navigate and switch sections with gestures — isn’t yet available. Indeed, Tapbots say that features like better management of multiple windows will be coming in the future, and they confirmed in a blog post that they are planning “ on making everything as beautiful and pixel perfect” as they can. Don’t be surprised if, in this version, some pixels will look misaligned or out of place. Eventually, it will all be fixed.  \n\nIt is with this standpoint that I want to look at Tweetbot again: you don’t need me to know what Tweetbot is or what it looks like. Between the Mac and iOS, we’ve covered Tweetbot [extensively here at MacStories](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/).\n\nWhat follows is my review of Tweetbot 1.0 based on *how I use* the final version of the app. The little features and the details I’ve come to rely upon, and the overall functionality that makes Tweetbot the best Twitter client for Mac.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\nOne of the key features missing from the initial alpha of Tweetbot was support for keyboard shortcuts. At some point, every Mac user – not necessarily [the “power” ones](http:\/\/5by5.tv\/mpu) – gets curious about keyboard shortcuts, as they can be fantastic timesavers. Tweetbot for Mac doesn’t disappoint: it comes with many different shortcuts for timelines (i.e. “views”) and tweets.\n\n### Navigation and Views\n\n**Command + 1…9** to open specific sections of the app. Sections are called “tabs”, and they are available in the Window menu. Available tabs are: Timeline (1), Mentions (2), Messages (3), Favorites (4), Search (5), Profile (6), Lists (7), Retweets (8), and Mutes (9).\n\nIf you’re already in a tab and you hit Command +1…9 the app will go back to the top level of the view (eg. you’re viewing someone’s profile, the app will go back to timeline) so you don’t have to hit the Back button. If you’re already in the top level, the shortcut will scroll to the top.\n\nTabs available in Tweetbot’s sidebar can be customized. From View > Displayed Tabs, choose the tabs you want to exclude from the sidebar by deselecting them. Even if a tab is hidden, you’ll still be able to access it with the shortcuts mentioned above.\n\nA bunch of shortcuts are available in the View menu:\n\n* You can scroll to top or bottom using **Command + Up** and **Command + Down**, respectively.\n* You can move to the Next Tab using **Command + ]** and to the Previous Tab using **Command + [** – choosing “Previous Tab” when you’re in the Timeline tab will cycle back to the bottom one (Mutes).\n* If you add Shift to the Previous\/Next Tab shortcut, you’ll get Previous\/Next Account.\n* Not listed, but you can Page up and down using Space and Shift + Space; this also works with Home and End on keyboards with those keys.\n\nIn Tweetbot, you can open Tabs in new windows or columns. You can also open specific views such as user profiles or a saved search in columns or windows. To open the current view in a new window, use **Command + Shift + N**; to open in a new column, the shortcut is **Command + Option + N**. You can then remove specific columns from the View > Columns menu, or by hitting the gear icon icon in the bottom right corner of the main window. You can **tab** and **shift-tab** to move between columns.\n\nTweetbot’s windows can be resized. However, the “separate” ones don’t support shortcuts for changing tabs, as they are, essentially, single-purpose views turned into a window.\n\nYou can go to a specific user by hitting **Command + U** and typing its username. Tweetbot will try to autocomplete it.\n\n### Actions\n\nTweetbot comes with several “action shortcuts” for tweets and integration with third-party services.\n\nTo compose a tweet, hit Command + N, and Command + W to close the compose box. If you’ve typed something in the box and try to close it, Tweetbot will ask you to save the tweet as a draft. Drafts can be opened with **Command + 0**, which will display a separate window for all your saved tweets; click on one, and the tweet will open again in the compose box, ready to be sent.\n\nYou can perform various actions on selected tweets. Command + R will initiate a reply to the author of a tweet, with additional mentioned usernames selected so you can remove them instantly (it basically defaults to Reply All). Command + D will send a Direct Message to the author; **F** will mark a tweet as favorite; T will retweet, and **Option + T** will “quote” the selected tweet. Command + K will mark all tweets in a tab as read.\n\nTweetbot uses streaming by default, but you can also manually refresh a view by pulling down tweets to unveil the loading bar, or by hitting Command + Shift + R. Please note, though, that if the app is streaming you can’t actually pull to refresh: if streaming *fails*, you can. You can also pull to refresh views that don’t stream, like Search and Lists.\n\nWhen a tweet is selected, the entire app is navigable using the keyboard: up\/down arrows will let you move between tweets, the right arrow key will open a tweet’s detail view and left will always work as a “Back” button. If you are in the tweet detail view and you hit the right arrow, you’ll go to the user’s profile.\n\nIt gets more interesting with actions available inside the **Tweet > Action** menu. You can open the links contained in a selected tweet with **Command + Shift + L**: if the link is a regular http:\/\/ hyperlink, it’ll open in the default browser; if it’s an inline image, the shortcut will bring up the app’s image viewer.\n\nThe image viewer comes with a sharing button to save the image (it’ll be placed in your Downloads folder), copy it, view it on the web, or tweet the URL. To close the image, you can hit Esc or the Space bar. In this first version of the app, I’ve encountered a bug that, when the browser is minimized in the Dock, will bring it up in slow motion (I assume it’s because the shortcut includes Shift, which triggers the slow-motion effect system-wide).\n\nThere are two more actions that have been assigned a keyboard shortcut: you can quickly open a user’s profile by pressing **Command + Shift + U** on a tweet; and if a tweet belongs to a conversation, you can hit Command + Shift + C to view it.\n\n## Contextual Menus\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&31575_con2.jpeg)\nadamtyree, I haven’t really blocked you. We’re cool.\n\nMenus \n\nWhere Tweetbot doesn’t get with keyboard shortcuts, it does with contextual menus. In July, I wrote:\n\n> That’s not to say, though, that Tapbots is simply taking a successful iOS app and putting a native Mac wrapper around it. Tweetbot for Mac wants to be a native Mac application, and for this reason Tapbots had to rethink some of the interactions that couldn’t be suitable for a point-and-click system such as the Mac.  \n\n> Because on the Mac it is possible to implement the concept of “hover” through the cursor, the tweet drawer’s options (reply, retweet, fave, share, more) are shown when hovering over a tweet, and they are presented inside contextual menus: this helps reducing the number of clicks needed to navigate around tweets, and it stays true to the nature of OS X while adapting Tweetbot’s existing feature to different patterns and possible scenarios.  \n\nIn Tweetbot for iOS, you can tap & hold on certain elements to bring up additional options; in Tweetbot for Mac, tap & hold becomes right-clicking (or Control-clicking).\n\n* A right-click on a tweet will let you: Copy Link to Tweet, Copy Tweet, Email Tweet, View Details\/Conversations\/Retweets, Open in Favstar, and Translate.\n* If you right-click on a link, you can send to a Read Later service, Tweet the URL, Open in Browser, Copy, and Email the URL.\n* Right-click on a user (link or profile picture) will check follow status, and offer options for DM, Manage in Lists, Disable Retweets, Mute, and Unfollow.\n* Right-click on a sidebar tab will let you open it in a new column or window.\n* Right-click on your own username will allow you to view your profile in Favstar; the same can be done by double-clicking on the Profile tab.\n* Double-clicking any tab scrolls it to the top (or to last-synced position).\n* Control-clicking on the retweet action icon in Timeline will let you choose the account to retweet from.\n* Control-clicking on the fave action icon in Timeline will let you award the “Tweet of the Day” through Favstar.\n\nOverall, I find the selection of Tweetbot’s contextual menus rich and intuitive – it’s in line with the iOS counterpart (therefore making it easy to switch between the two), yet, at the same time, it stays true to the nature of the Mac.\n\n### Gestures\n\nThere’s one area of the app where I think Tapbots could have done more: gestures. Right now, Tweetbot only supports:\n\n* Two finger swipe –> Status details\n* Two finger swipe <– Conversation\n\nIn my Twitter for Mac days, I quickly became a fan of the three-finger gesture that allowed you to swipe vertically to move between sections in the sidebar. I wish Tapbots did the same for tabs in Tweetbot. I’d also like to see gestures from iOS, such as triple taps, finding their way to the Mac. I do appreciate how Tapbots decided to render text natively in the app, thus enabling OS X system features such as triple tap to define in Dictionary within the Timeline (however, text is only selectable in the tweet detail view).\n\nTo overcome the lack of vertical swipes to change tabs, I set up two [BetterTouchTool](http:\/\/blog.boastr.net\/) gestures for the job: swipe up to go to the next tab, swipe down to go up (per Apple’s own scrolling paradigm). On my computer, which has keyboard input set to Italian, I had to go with one extra step to pipe the shortcut for changing tabs through Keyboard Maestro, as I [showed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/statuses\/258604407829176320) yesterday; if you don’t want to use Keyboard Maestro, you could achieve the same “hack” using BetterTouchTool and [GUI scripting](http:\/\/www.macosxautomation.com\/applescript\/uiscripting\/index.html), or anything that associates gestures with Tweetbot’s Previous\/Next Tab menu. I also noticed a visual bug in which, occasionally, the selected tab won’t be properly highlighted in the sidebar.\n\n## Using Tweetbot\n\nHere’s how I use Tweetbot: I leave it open all day, reading my timeline and checking for links to interesting stuff that happens online. If someone mentions me, I want to double-check what I’m replying to, and I want to be able to see an entire conversation. I mark a lot of tweets as favorite (more [here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/send-favorite-tweets-to-omnifocus-inbox\/) ), I have a saved search for “MacStories”, and I mute a lot of hashtags or keywords I’m not interested into (such as sports and [politics](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/tweetbot-mute-filters-for-u-s-elections\/) ). Every once in a while, I try to be a witty and funny guy with [Matthew Panzarino](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/author\/matthewpanzarino\/) or my colleague [Don](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/author\/don\/).\n\nI need a Twitter client that can handle the workflow described above and, more importantly, remember my position in the Timeline.\n\nTweetbot fits like a glove. Maybe it’s because I got used to the app over time. Or perhaps I’m just particularly good at feature requests. Any way I look at it, I can’t seem to find any other client that can achieve the same degree of functionality.\n\nThere’s a fine line between consistency and uniqueness on each platform, and Tweetbot walks it gracefully. The design cues are the same, the interactions are shared across devices, but there’s always a little implementation detail or a subtle graphical change that reminds you which Tweetbot is which. Quite paradoxically, there are more differences between various instances of Tweetbot than between Tweetbot and [Netbot](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/netbot-tweetbot-reborn-for-app-net\/).\n\n### Columns\n\nTweetbot for Mac lets you put sections and views in columns. As those who’ve used apps like Tweetdeck before may remember, columns can become an important “productivity booster” for people who use Twitter for, say, customer support and need to keep an eye on replies and saved searches.\n\nWith the aforementioned “Open in New Column” command, you can do exactly that. During major Apple events or news, for example, I like to keep columns open on saved searches and MacStories’ mention stream so I can stay on top of the tweets being shared.\n\nIn Tweetbot, columns “snap” onto an existing window on the right. You can create multiple columns, but you can’t switch the section focus of a column once it’s been created. To “detach” a column to make it a window and close it, grab the “handle” in the bottom bar and drag the column away. There are still some bugs with attaching columns of different sizes to the main window.\n\nFor a future version of the app, I’d like to see full-screen support, as it makes sense for layouts of 3+ columns.\n\n### Custom Uploads\n\nTweetbot for Mac is, as far as I know, the only Twitter client that supports custom API endpoints for media uploads. I asked our [Don Southard](https:\/\/twitter.com\/binaryghost) to put together a solution that would leverage our Rackspace CDN to handle images and videos; he came up with an easy way to share images in Tweetbot natively, using our own server. You can find his explanation of the feature below.\n\n#### Custom Uploads\n\nTweetbot is the only Twitter client for Mac (that I know of) that supports the ability to upload your photos to a custom image service of your choice. This includes the ability to host your own image sharing service on a web server with nothing more than a few lines of PHP. So what we made is a simple PHP script that we self-host; it accepts the image from Tweetbot and responds with the uploaded URL.\n\nTweetbot provides [short but useful information](http:\/\/tapbots.net\/tweetbot\/custom_media\/) about how it uses HTTP POST to upload the picture and what information is passed along with the image.\n\nFor the MacStories image upload service we opted to use our Rackspace Cloud Files account to host the images. They have a great PHP library that does all the hard work of getting the image objects on to the server. After the image is uploaded to Rackspace the script only needs to echo a JSON encoded response. This code is saved to a PHP file on your web server along with the  [Cloud Files PHP library](https:\/\/github.com\/rackspace\/php-cloudfiles).\n\n**Update 10\/19**: Modified the scripts adding a check to make sure they can only receive images or videos (not scripts or other files). Keep in mind, the URL of the PHP file is private – don’t share it with anyone.\n\n>   \n```\n<?php\n\r\n\/\/ include the API\n\r\nrequire('cloudfiles.php');\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Rackspace Info\n\r\n$username = \"USERNAME\"; \/\/ username\n\r\n$key = \"XXX\"; \/\/ api key\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Connect to Rackspace\n\r\n$auth = new CF_Authentication($username, $key);\n\r\n$auth->authenticate();\n\r\n$conn = new CF_Connection($auth);\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Get the container we want to use\n\r\n$container = $conn->get_container('Mobile_Uploads');\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ store image information from Tweetbot\n\r\n$localfile = $_FILES['media']['tmp_name'];\n\r\n$filename = $_FILES['media']['name'];\n\r\n\r\n\/\/ Image filetype check source:\n\r\n\/\/ http:\/\/designshack.net\/articles\/php-articles\/smart-file-type-detection-using-php\/\n\r\n$imginfo_array = getimagesize($localfile);\n\r\n\r\nif ($imginfo_array !== false) {\n\r\n    $mime_type = $imginfo_array['mime'];\n\r\n    $mime_array = array(\"video\/quicktime\", \"image\/png\", \"image\/jpeg\", \"image\/gif\", \"image\/bmp\");\n\r\n    if (in_array($mime_type , $mime_array)) {\n \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t$now = time();\n\r\n\t\t$uploadFilename = $now.'-'.$filename;\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\/\/ upload image to Rackspace\n\r\n\t\t$object = $container->create_object($uploadFilename);\n\r\n\t\t$object->load_from_filename($localfile);\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\/\/ Respond image URL to Tweetbot (Change to your URL)\n\r\n\t\t$outputFilename = 'http:\/\/files.domain.com\/' . basename($uploadFilename);\n\r\n\t\t$response = array(url=>$outputFilename);\n\r\n\t\techo json_encode($response);\n\r\n \r\n    }\n\r\n}\n\r\nelse {\n\r\n    echo \"This is not a valid image file\";\n\r\n}\n\r\n\r\n?>\n```\n\nMost of you probably do not have a Rackspace Cloud Files account and that’s not a problem because you can also just upload images directly to the web server with only a few tweaks.\n\nWithout the Rackspace dependencies this code is even simpler. Save this PHP code to a file (ie. upload.php) on your web server.\n\n>   \n```\n<?php\n   \r\n\/\/server-side directory\n\r\n$directory_self = str_replace(basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']), '', $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);\n \r\n$uploadsDirectory = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $directory_self .

Tweetbot will send images to your server and you can enjoy the warm fuzzy feeling that comes with hosting, sharing, and owning your own photos online.\n\nIn addition to hosting your own PHP script for uploading images, you can also setup a custom domain. In your domain provider’s DNS settings, simply forward that directly to the directory that will be hosting your images.\n\nWe have been using Tweetbot’s custom uploads for weeks, and we’re really enjoying it from both Tweetbot for iOS as well as Tweetbot for Mac.\n\n## Services\n\nTweetbot for Mac upholds Tapbots’ tradition to support a plethora of third-party services for sharing and bookmarking. Here are the ones supported in version 1.0:\n\n**URL Shortening**\n\n* Twitter\n* Bitly\n* CloudApp\n* Droplr\n* Custom\n\n**Image Upload**\n\n* CloudApp\n* Droplr\n* img.ly\n* Lockerz\n* Mobypicture\n* Pikchur\n* Posterous\n* Twitgoo\n* TwitPic\n* Twitter\n* yfrog\n* Custom\n\n**Video Upload**\n\n* CloudApp\n* Droplr\n* Mobypicture\n* Pikchur\n* Posterous\n* TwitVid\n* yfrog\n* Custom\n\n**Read Later**\n\n* bitly\n* Instapaper\n* Pinboard\n* Pocket\n* Readability\n\nI think the selection is solid; however, I would like to be able to send links to both Instapaper and Pinboard, without having to pick one.\n\n## Sync and Notifications\n\nLike the iOS version, Tweetbot for Mac supports Tweet Marker and Notification Center. The settings are exactly the same.\n\nThe Mac version also introduces iCloud sync on the desktop, which lets you keep timeline position, as well as read status on DMs and mute filters in sync. In my tests, I had some initial issues in getting Tweetbot for Mac and Tweetbot for iPhone to communicate with each other, and developer Paul Haddad reiterated how iCloud, in its current version, [is still far from perfect](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/the-state-of-icloud-enabled-apps\/). Indeed, it took a few restarts and forced quits before both versions were synced up correctly. After that, everything was pretty smooth and fast – I especially like the convenience of keeping filters consistent between devices.\n\nAs for notifications, I just like how they stay in Notification Center and allow me to go through them later.\n\n## Tips & Tricks\n\nTweetbot’s image viewer supports animated GIFs.\n\nWhen someone faves one of your tweets, it gets the same yellow ribbon tweets *you* fave get. At first I thought I had accidentally faved a tweet of mine. Confusing.\n\nTweetbot’s menubar item is quite powerful: it lists all your accounts and shows you, through badges, how many unread tweets you have in the Timeline, Mentions, and Direct Messages. It lets you jump to those sections by just clicking, and you can even tweet from the menubar item without launching the full app. I wish Tapbots made a keyboard shortcut for this.\n\nFrom the tweet compose box, you can switch between accounts by clicking on your profile picture.\n\nYou can access the same location menu of Tweetbot for iOS by clicking on the location data in the tweet compose box.\n\nUnfortunately, Tweetbot 1.0 doesn’t have an AppleScript dictionary.\n\nYou can edit your Profile without leaving Tweetbot. Just open the Profile tab and click Edit in the upper right corner. You can also change your avatar from the app using the Mac’s standard photo picker.\n\nClicking on a location in a tweet will open Google Maps in the browser. Same with Translate.\n\nYou can drag the compose box to wherever you like.\n\nWith the exception of Search, the same URL scheme of Tweetbot for iOS works on the Mac. It is documented [here](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme). Below, you can find the code for two bookmarklets I have created to tweet a webpage’s URL and a webpage’s Title + URL (too add these, create a new bookmark and replace its address with the code below).\n\n**Tweet title + URL**\n`javascript:window.location='tweetbot:\/\/\/post?text='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+' '+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)`\n\n**Tweet URL**\n`javascript:window.location='tweetbot:\/\/\/post?text='+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href)`\n\nYou can drag tweets out of Tweetbot.\n\nDragging a tweet to the desktop will create a .webloc file pointing directly to the tweet’s URL; dragging it into iMessage or Mail will insert the tweet’s link as text; dropping a tweet onto Safari’s icon in the Dock will open a new tab for the tweet. This also works with URLs – you can drag those out from within a tweet.\n\n## Still The Best\n\nTweetbot for Mac isn’t the app for people who casually check on Twitter every couple of days: it is [priced at $19.99](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?ls=1&amp;mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg), a clear signal as to the kind of audience Tapbots want to capture. On the other hand, it’s also understandable why Tapbots may want to [save precious Twitter tokens](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apps\/2012\/08\/27\/tweetbot-mac-alpha-pulled-due-new-twitter-rules-developer-preserving-user-slots-official-release\/) for users who really value the feature set of Tweetbot.\n\nThree months ago, what we had was a great Twitter client with several missing features and some rough edges. But, following the premature demise of Twitter for Mac, it *already* was the most powerful one, suggesting good things would be coming soon. Today, Tweetbot for Mac is faster, more reliable (albeit still not perfect, as [some graphical glitches](https:\/\/313e5987718b346aaf83-f5e825270f29a84f7881423410384342.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/glitch.png) persist), and more functional. It is the rightful evolution of an app that showed its potential earlier this year.\n\nTwitter clients are a very personal matter. Using them on a daily basis, they become deeply entrenched in our workflows and, often, they turn into the apps we’re least likely to give up on. Ask the people who still think Twitter for Mac will eventually get an update. For me, Tweetbot works because it’s got what I need from a Twitter client.\n\nWith Tweetbot for Mac, I give my last and official goodbye to [the app that used to be Tweetie](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/goodbye-tweetie\/).\n\nWe don’t know what the future looks like for third-party Twitter clients. For now, with the Mac version, Tweetbot has created its own ecosystem inside Twitter.\n\n[Tweetbot for Mac Review](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/)\n\n# Netbot: Tweetbot Reborn for App.net\n\nToday, App.net gets its best iOS third-party client to date, and, unsurprisingly, it comes from Tapbots. [Netbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/netbot\/) is now available on the App Store for [iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fnetbot-for-iphone-app.net%252Fid563595132%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and [iPad](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fnetbot-for-ipad-app.net-client%252Fid563596528%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30).\n\nWhat’s not surprising isn’t simply the fact that Tapbots released an app that sets the bar higher for the competition; at first, it’s the fact that Netbot is basically Tweetbot re-engineered to work for [App.net](https:\/\/join.app.net\/).\n\n## Join The Movement\n\nBefore I take a look at the App.net-exclusive features Netbot has to offer, allow me to take a step back and quickly re-evaluate the current state of [App.net](http:\/\/blog.app.net\/blog\/2012\/08\/29\/what-is-app-net\/). Officially [announced 12 weeks ago](http:\/\/daltoncaldwell.com\/an-audacious-proposal), the “movement” quickly see 10,000 users become members of a service that promised to re-imagine social feeds with a solid business plan and third-party developers in mind. In spite of its evident similarities with Twitter, CEO Dalton Caldwell and his team immediately started working on some key areas that could differentiate App.net from Twitter. They added things like [annotations](http:\/\/blog.app.net\/blog\/2012\/08\/31\/we-shipped-annotations\/), kept on improving the [API spec](https:\/\/github.com\/appdotnet\/api-spec\/blob\/master\/objects.md) and Alpha webapp, and promised more features like [private messages](https:\/\/alpha.app.net\/dalton\/post\/601786) would come relatively soon.\n\nLet’s face it: some people would be perfectly fine with having a “Twitter with a paid model” service. That’s what they have been [asking](http:\/\/www.businessweek.com\/articles\/2012-08-07\/should-twitter-charge-users-pay-them-or-both) for years (yours truly included). Yet App.net wants to go beyond simply copying Twitter and adding paid plans on top of it; [some aren’t sure](http:\/\/macdrifter.com\/2012\/10\/status-networks.html) that’s exactly what they need, but they’re backing the project anyway.\n\nThere’s a joke to be made about App.net [having more apps](http:\/\/blog.app.net\/blog\/2012\/09\/14\/more-app-net-tools-keep-em-coming\/) than users. Because of its developer-friendly nature, developers have quickly jumped on board creating [mobile clients](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/app-nets-first-two-ios-clients-rhino-and-adian\/), desktop apps, and web tools that leverage the App.net API to do standard things like displaying a user stream, or more forward-thinking ideas like…playing [chess](https:\/\/github.com\/mattflaschen\/apppassant).\n\nJohn Gruber once said [Twitter clients were a UI design playground](http:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2009\/04\/twitter_clients_playground). In following the App.net scene for the past weeks, I’ve felt like it’s 2009 all over again. There are already a dozen App.net-enabled apps [available on the App Store](http:\/\/ax.search.itunes.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZSearch.woa\/wa\/search?entity=software&amp;media=all&amp;page=1&amp;restrict=false&amp;startIndex=0&amp;term=app.net). I can tell you I’ve been offered to beta test another dozen, and the [public third-party development page](https:\/\/github.com\/appdotnet\/api-spec\/wiki\/Directory-of-third-party-devs-and-apps) shows many more for just about any platform out there.\n\nYet iOS is “where it’s at”. The majority of developers willing to build software for App.net understands the big opportunity of being *first* on a new platform that’s perfect for mobile access. App.net by itself is a service that encourages the creation of software with business plans, so developers aren’t afraid of charging users who had no problems paying $50 to join a Twitter-like service. All these factors combined have led to a promising third-party scene that’s getting bigger by the day. With [a new pricing model](http:\/\/blog.app.net\/blog\/2012\/10\/01\/app-net-pricing-changes\/), App.net could have found the right mix between “premium” and quicker user adoption, which had somewhat slowed down recently.\n\nWith this background, it’s easy to understand why Tapbots decided to embrace App.net right away rather than waiting. As Twitter [keeps getting more hostile](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/twitter\/2012\/09\/21\/why-ifttt-forced-remove-twitter-triggers-red-alert-developers\/) to third-party developers, Tapbots is in the strange position of having a powerful and feature-rich client that could be hampered by the decisions of Twitter [the company](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/statuses\/253168714084675585). And make no mistake, Tapbots did build a very powerful client for iPhone and iPad.\n\nOn the other hand, App.net works for the most part like Twitter; its users don’t have a problem with paying for value; and they’re looking for a solid client to settle with. Playing around with clients is cool, but eventually people will grow tired with spending $5 every two days. They’ll want something that *works*. And Tweetbot has proved that it can work for a vast portion of Twitter users. So why not App.net?\n\nI think Tapbots is making a good call here. They have refactored a great app for a platform that:\n\n* Is friendlier to developers\n* Promises to **remain** friendly\n* Has a decent userbase that is okay with the idea of “paying for software”\n* Lacks “the best” third-party client\n* Hopefully won’t screw developers over policy changes any time soon.\n\nWe could argue all day on the value proposition of App.net and their long-term plans, but I don’t think it’s difficult to see why Tapbots decided to make a Netbot out of Tweetbot. In plain business terms, even if 10,000 users out of 20,000+ bought the iPhone app, that would still be good revenue for Tapbots. And I think more people will buy it. Not to mention there’s a standalone iPad app, too.\n\nApp-savvy iPhone and iPad users have a knack for finding what’s good.\n\nWhereas the average iOS user might prefer the free app that’s doing well in the charts, we tend to look at fine pieces of software that have been carefully crafted by developers who care about making great products. [We support indie developers](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/greed-and-entitlements\/) and we’re always curious to check out new apps that might improve our workflows. Sometimes, we [fiddle](http:\/\/www.macdrifter.com\/2012\/08\/fiddle-sticks.html).\n\nOther times, though, an app becomes so entrenched in our system we develop a habit of sticking with it. For me, such app is a Twitter client like Tweetbot. I constantly check Twitter, and I find it extremely hard at this point to even try another client that doesn’t look or behave like Tweetbot. I can’t tell you how hard it was from me to switch from Tweetie to Tweetbot. Tapbots figured that, with a service that shares the same basic functionalities of Twitter, now is the right time to get people hooked to a go-to client. Because these things tend to stick around.\n\n## Netbot\n\nI don’t need to review Netbot. If you’ve read my previous reviews of [Tweetbot for iPhone](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-2-0-review\/) and [iPad](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-for-ipad-review\/) and [coverage of updates](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/tweetbot\/), you know how Netbot looks and works. The UI elements are the same; the gestures are the same; the entire navigation structure is the same. Netbot is Tweetbot reworked for App.net – Tapbots obviously had to change the whole underlying code to migrate from Twitter to the App.net API. It is different inside, it looks the same on the outside. There are, though, some differences and exclusive features that App.net users will have to consider.\n\nNotably, some options had to be removed from Tweetbot in its transition to Netbot. The App.net API doesn’t yet support Places for geo-location, so Tapbots decided to exclude location from this first version. Similarly, App.net doesn’t support push and direct messages yet, so Netbot doesn’t have those for now. Other features that are specific to Twitter – such as t.co URL shortening and trends – are obviously missing from Netbot as well. I am told that Tapbots plans to support push and DMs once ADN makes them available, and I have reason to believe Tapbots is truly committed to supporting the future key features of App.net. Right now, Netbot supports almost every part of the API that was live as of a couple of weeks ago; annotations were announced too late, and I don’t know whether Tapbots will support them in the future.\n\n## Made for App.net\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&profile.png)\nNetbot profile \n\nWhile some parts of Tweetbot got lost in translation, Netbot gained a few App.net-specific functionalities and design ideas. The profile page, for instance, shows both the profile picture and cover photo, allowing you to tap on both to view them in full-screen (you can also pull down the cover photo to make it “grow”). At first I thought cover photos looked funny, now I wish Tweetbot supported them for Twitter accounts.\n\nThe Search screen has been tweaked. App.net doesn’t have public search yet, so Netbot’s search will allow you to search for users or go to a specific username. However, the search screen has two new features: Find Twitter Friends and Global Stream. The latter is a simple visualization of App.net’s global stream of all posts, which is still manageable because of the relatively low volume. Remember when Twitter had a global stream? Good times.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&search.png)\nNetbot search \n\nFind Friends is more interesting. It plugs directly into the Twitter accounts configured in iOS’ Settings to compare users that you follow on Twitter who are also on App.net. This feature relies on plain username comparison to find people that are using both services; in my tests, it took a few minutes to analyze the 900+ people I follow on Twitter, but after that, I was presented a nice screen listing all the found users. [Knowing Twitter](http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/08\/22\/twitter-tumblr\/), they’ll probably find a way to block this option. In the meantime, it is a clever addition that leverages a native element of iOS to make for a more intuitive experience – I found many people to follow on App.net thanks to this.\n\nUsing the same idea, Netbot comes with cross-posting to Twitter built-in. Now, I am not a fan of cross-posting: I find it annoying when people post the same status on multiple social networks. I think every social network is unique, and so should be the behavior of its users. However, I understand that some people like this, and that there are some cases in which it comes in handy (example: you’re looking for help on something).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&cross.png)\nNetbot crosspost \n\nCross-posting in Netbot is off by default and also quite hidden. To cross-post to Twitter, you have to create a new post, then tap on New Post in the top bar to bring up a menu that’s similar to Tweetbot’s timeline selector (on the iPad, tap on your profile picture in the New Post screen). Here, you can select the App.net account you want to post with, and additional Twitter accounts for cross-posting. If you activate cross-posting, your post will be sent to App.net and Twitter. You can select multiple Twitter accounts, too.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&star_and_reposts.png)\nNetbot stars \n\nAnother feature that Tapbots built specifically for Netbot is the repost and star count. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve wished Tweetbot allowed me to easily see how many retweets or faves a tweet of mine (or any other tweet) had received. Thanks to the App.net API, the post detail screen of Netbot features small black popups for repost and star counts. Tapping on them will reveal the users that have reposted or starred a post. The great thing about this little feature is that it indirectly promotes discovery of new users. By seeing who else is starring a post, I can find people with tastes similar to mine. Twitter has some kind of similar functionality for retweets, but I always found it clumsy and not as elegant as this one. Plus, I’m a sucker for stars, so Netbot helps in sating my thirst for social *ego* stats (that is, until Favstar will support App.net).\n\nObviously, the implementation of reposts and stars is native, although Netbot offers “quote formats” for reposts in the Settings.\n\n## From The Past and Into The Future\n\nBe honest: aside from 256 characters, have you used App.net *that* differently from Twitter?\n\nFor me, App.net is, right now, a [Good Guy Twitter](http:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/good-guy-greg). On the outside, the service is essentially the same, but its creators have bigger (and different) plans for its API and third-party support. These new APIs still have to reveal [their full potential](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apps\/2012\/09\/29\/slick-app-net-client-rivr-uses-annotations-beautifully-display-images-locations\/), so, like I said, *for now* I’m using App.net as “another Twitter”. I think we all are.\n\nAs more people keep switching from Twitter to ADN and the service gets more exclusive functionality, Caldwell’s vision will mature into a more “complete” and unique product.\n\nAs ADN grows and distances itself from Twitter, the gap between Tweetbot and Netbot will have to grow bigger as well. Netbot can’t be similar to Tweetbot forever. Once ADN finds its unique path (both in terms of interactions and feature set), Netbot will have to adapt.\n\nRight now, Netbot looks like Tweetbot because App.net still looks like Twitter. But new things are coming. I, for one, have big hopes for annotations, which will let developers attach useful information to posts. Here’s an [example](http:\/\/blog.app.net\/blog\/2012\/09\/21\/friday-update-crosspost-and-some-new-apps\/).\n\nShould you buy Netbot? If you like Tweetbot, yes. If you’re not a fan of Tapbots’ take on Twitter clients, Netbot won’t make you change your mind. Netbot has some features that are built only for App.net, but they aren’t enough to justify a full-on reconsideration of Tweetbot. If you, however, do use and like Tweetbot, then go ahead. You won’t regret the purchase.\n\nPersonally, I’ve been looking for a truly powerful client for App.net. Over time, third-party clients have come to define the services we use. I wouldn’t be able to go back to using the Twitter app or Twitter website because my thumbs now automatically reach out to Tweetbot’s buttons or swipe actions. And I believe this explains why, in trying the first App.net clients that came out, I had a strange feeling of incompleteness. It felt like Twitter, but with a less powerful app to go with.\n\nNetbot solves my issues. It’s got iCloud sync across the iPhone and iPad so I can pick up where I left off; it’s got the same tap & hold actions I’m used to for copying links and URLs; the interface is the same, so I already know how to navigate around it. Netbot feels like a natural implementation of an App.client. At the moment, Netbot is **the** full-featured, fast, reliable, and stable client App.net users were looking for.\n\nIt’s not completely new, but does it matter?\n\nLooking ahead, I think the future of Tweetbot is Netbot. Tapbots [had an idea](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/tweetbot\/tweetbot-is-coming) for what a “real-time social feed” client should look like, and they started with Tweetbot because Twitter was the cool-and-friendly real-time social network. But [Twitter has changed](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/twitter\/2012\/09\/21\/the-truth-twitter\/). At some point, Twitter the company decided it was time to start making money, and took the [necessary steps](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/twitter\/2012\/08\/21\/twitter-secured\/) to get there. As in every [Trilemma](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/the-ios-6-trilemma\/), out of three options (the company, the developers, the users), one had to be the least favorable. Twitter made a series of choices that caused developers to grow increasingly uncomfortable with the service. And that point, developers had to make their move.\n\nFor Tapbots, Netbot is an investment into the future.\n\n- [Netbot for iPhone](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fnetbot-for-iphone-app.net%252Fid563595132%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n- [Netbot for iPad](http:\/\/click.linksynergy.com\/fs-bin\/stat?id=FppfamX*gDg&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fnetbot-for-ipad-app.net-client%252Fid563596528%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)\n\n[Netbot: Tweetbot Reborn for App.net](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/netbot-tweetbot-reborn-for-app-net\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 2.4 Brings New Search View, Keyword Mute Filters, Refinements\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&29887_search-and-top.png)\nFollowing updates focused on [iCloud sync](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-gets-icloud-sync-for-timelines-dms-and-mute-filters\/) and [gestures](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-3-adds-new-gestures-integrations-ui-refinements\/), Tweetbot 2.4, released today on the App Store ( [iPhone](http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-twitter-client-personality\/id428851691?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg), [iPad](http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-twitter-client-personality\/id498801050?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=FppfamX*gDg) ), brings an updated search view with additional location features, relocated Trends and People categories, and various improvements that make the client’s search functionality more powerful and intuitive.\n\n## Search\n\nThe new Search tab unifies Trends, People, and Top Tweets under a Browse section, with Saved Searches and the classic search box still available at the top of the screen. The dedicated Top Tweets option is quite enjoyable – I have indeed found myself browsing such flow of status updates on a couple of times for the occasional laugh or remarkably snarky tweet. Top tweets now also show up in regular search results, and they are marked by a silver star indicator.\n\nTrends, on the other hand, can be changed to another location directly from the search view of Tweetbot 2.4 – I don’t use Trends, but I assume the option will come in handy for those who, for some reason, like to check the recurring trend in Italy.\n\nThe big addition in Tweetbot’s new search interface is support for nearby tweets. Here, you can view nearby tweets with the ability to change your location (just tap on the embedded Google Map), and you can perform location-based keyword searches for tweets containing specific words that also happen to be located near you. Unfortunately, Viterbo resembles a ghost town when it comes to looking for fellow local MacStories readers. I asked Tapbots, and they confirmed my town’s insistence of loading @viticci as the only local MacStories tweeter isn’t an app’s bug.\n\nThere are two more little touches I like in Tweetbot 2.4: you can double-tap the search tab to open search with the keyboard, and the search box has been optimized to let you easily jump to tweets, users, or a specific @user without additional taps.\n\n## Keyword Mute Filters\n\nTweetbot has been offering advanced mute filtering options for [quite some time now](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-1-5\/). Version 2.4 now allows you to block specific keywords – not just users or clients – and there’s even support for [regular expression](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regular_expression) if you really want to make sure you’re not reading about the latest spoilers in Game Of Thrones. Mentions can be muted as well.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThere are plenty of other refinements in Tweetbot 2.4. Offline support, for instance, will ensure tweets marked as favorite or sent to a Read Later service when no Internet connection is available will get “queued”, then sent\/favorited as soon as you come back online. Sure enough, while browsing my timeline in Airplane mode, I fave’d a couple of tweets, sent some links to Pocket, and Tweetbot queued them. When I turned WiFi back on, the app refreshed, the tweets were marked as favorites in my account, and they appeared in my Pocket.\n\nOn the iPad, web and map views can now be dismissed with a two-finger swipe down gesture, which I found incredibly convenient and faster than reaching out for the Close button in the upper left corner. Also on the iPad, list views show one line of a list or profile description, and when viewing an image in full-screen, you can hold down for options.\n\nAdditionally, aside from the usual bug fixes, you can now swipe to the right on profile views to go back; items sent to Pinboard are marked as unread; and last, the compose screen comes with basic smart quote support (for quotes, em dash, and ellipsis).\n\nWith powerful new features and UI refinements added to an existing set of great functionalities, Tweetbot 2.4 retains familiarity while striving to remain the best third-party Twitter app for iOS.

Among the notable features of this new version, Tapbots is introducing notifications for specific users, support for inline Flickr and Vine previews, and compliance with the Twitter 1.1 API.\n\n[Announced last year](https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/blog\/changes-coming-to-twitter-api), the new Twitter API will force Tweetbot users to upgrade to Tweetbot 1.2 or later by March 5, 2013. After that date, all previous versions of Tweetbot will stop working. For the end user, updating Tweetbot for the new API means Tapbots had to alter some graphical elements of the app: among various changes, your own tweets will no longer be shown with an avatar on the right side of the timeline; profiles can now be opened on Twitter.com; and, you can click on the timestamp in a tweet’s detail view to open that tweet directly in the browser with a single click.\n\nI have to say, in using Tweetbot 1.2 for the past few weeks I have come to like the easier opening of profiles and tweets on the Twitter website, but I’m still getting used to seeing my tweets with my profile picture on the left side. I haven’t noticed other changes that have impacted my usability of the app.\n\nA great addition in Tweetbot 1.2 is the possibility to receive notifications when a specific user tweets. To do so, you can control-click on a user you’re following and choose Enable\/Disable Notifications to receive alerts for new tweets. My wish is that this feature will someday come in the form of *push* notifications to the iPhone and iPad: it would be particularly handy for my workflow to keep the app closed and yet receive notifications for specific users that I care about.[❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-1-2-brings-notifications-for-specific-users-vine-previews-ui-tweaks\/#fn:1)\n\nThere are several changes and fixes that, while subtle, can fix those annoyances that add up over time. Double-clicking the Profile tab now respects the setting for background links in the browser; thumbnail support for Vine and Flickr is consistent with the latest update to the iOS app; you can now add .mp4 files to tweets, GIF uploading has been fixed, and images or video files can be dragged onto the app icon to compose a new tweet; “finally”, accounts can be reordered in the Preferences. As shown in the screenshot above, the Notifications panel in the Settings now comes with more control over the notifications you want to show in Tweetbot’s dock icon and menubar item.\n\nIt’s good to see that Twitter’s API requirements haven’t been a detriment to Tweetbot’s efficiency so far.

After the launch of [Twitter’s own photo service](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twitter#Integrated_photo-sharing_service) and rise in popularity of services like Instagram, usage of pictures – either photos or screenshots – among the people I follow has skyrocketed. Apps like TweetGlass (nèe [Quip](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/quip-a-new-ipad-twitter-app-with-a-focus-on-conversations\/) ) succesfully explored the concept of letting users browse “media updates” in a dedicated feed, so why not Tweetbot?\n\nThe latest version of Tapbots’ client, [available today](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), does just that: it adds a media timeline to show only supported images and video tweets (the ones that you’d normally see displayed inline as thumbnails).\n\nTo access the new media timeline, you can scroll at the top of the regular timeline and – both on the iPhone and iPad – hit the media button next to the search bar. In the media timeline, status updates containing pictures or videos will show their respective media fully expanded inline, ready to be tapped to be viewed in full-screen. Imagine a mix of Tweetbot’s existing style and Instagram’s photo feed and you get the idea.\n\nTweets are shown right above the picture\/video they contain, and you can tap the text of a tweet to open the usual tweet detail view – which now displays the amount of faves\/retweets a tweet has received (unfortunately, you can’t tap these to show a list of users who have faved\/retweeted that tweet).\n\nUpon tapping on an image in Tweetbot 2.8, you’ll also notice how the image viewer has been completely redone to act like [its Mac counterpart](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-review\/). Tapping on an image in Tweetbot 2.8 shows the same loading indicator of Tweetbot for Mac (which is good for consistency across platforms) and brings images in the foreground with a delightful animation that is reminiscent of Facebook for iOS’ image viewer, only a bit faster. Like Facebook, you can dismiss images with a vertical swipe (on the iPhone); both on the iPhone and iPad, you can also tap anywhere on the screen to close the modal image viewer. I’m a big fan of Facebook’s swipe-to-close-image implementation, and I’m glad Tweetbot for iPhone now works in the same way (primarily because always reaching out to the Back button in the top left corner [can get tiresome for me](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/iphone-5-review\/) ).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-04-22_233558-tb28ipad.png)\nTweetbot \n\nI only have some minor gripes with the media timeline. In order to keep the same size of tweets across the entire timeline, sometimes longer tweets are cut off, forcing you to open the detail view to read them in full (you can see this [here](https:\/\/90a2cc4b7deb50ba0492-5793e9161196cd023f2e1f1322f2910e.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com\/2013-04-22_233603-tb28cutoff.PNG) ); you can’t tap on a user’s avatar to go to his\/her timeline; and, you can’t tap & hold on the inline preview – you have to open the image and then tap & hold to bring up the contextual menu.\n\nAnother addition that I’d like to see would be an option to switch to the media timeline from anywhere (not just from a button at the top) while maintaining reading position. I imagine this could be done by adding a tap & hold option to the Timeline tab bar item – but, again, I understand why Tapbots went for a simpler approach.[❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/#fn:1)\n\nOverall, I’m a fan of the new media timeline. It makes scrolling through photos a more relaxed, visual experience that is well distinct from Tweetbot’s more option-rich regular timeline. The new image viewer is fast, smooth, and easy to use; Instagram previews have been fixed; and, obviously, various bug fixes and improvements are awaiting in this release as well.\n\nTweetbot 2.8 is available now on the App Store.\n\n[Tweetbot 2.8 Adds Media Timeline](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/)\n\n# Tweetbot for Mac 1.3 Adds Media Timeline, More Tweaks\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-05-30_17-50-36-tb13.png)\nFollowing the [2.8 update released on iOS in April](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-2-8-adds-media-timeline\/), Tapbots today updated [Tweetbot for Mac](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/mac\/) to version 1.3, which adds various tweaks to the interface as well as the media timeline that debuted on the iPhone and iPad.\n\nTo access the new media timeline, which provides an inline media view of all timelines in Tweetbot, you can hit ⌘F and click on the icon next to the search bar, or, alternatively, choose View > Media Timeline (⌥⌘M with the keyboard). The media timeline retains the same functionality and design that Tapbots first brought to the iPhone; to switch back to the default timeline, you can click another icon next to the search bar or go to View > Default Timeline (⌥⌘T).\n\nComplying with Twitter’s new display guidelines, the tweet detail view now comes with retweet and favorite counters – again, implemented just like in Tweetbot for iOS. And alongside a series of bug fixes and improvements, Tweetbot 1.3 brings a welcome enhancement to profile views: besides Cover Image support, you can now double-click the titlebar on a profile to scroll back to the top. Double-clicking again will scroll a profile’s timeline to the top as well.\n\nTweetbot for Mac 1.3 is [available now on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-for-twitter\/id557168941?mt=12).\n\n[Tweetbot for Mac 1.3 Adds Media Timeline, More Tweaks](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-mac-1-3-adds-media-timeline-more-tweaks\/)\n\n# Tweetbot 3.1 Brings Text Size Controls, Timeline Switcher, Quick Actions\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&1384130721-2013-11-11-at-01-44-53-TB31_main.png)\n[Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/) for iPhone [may have grown up](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/), but it hasn’t forgotten about the features and design decisions that made it a powerful and popular Twitter client among iOS users for the past two years. Tweetbot 3.1, [available today on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline), improves upon last month’s major release by bringing back some old features of Tweetbot 2.x and introducing new ones, always taking advantage of iOS 7’s design and structure in interesting ways.\n\n### Timeline Switcher\n\nThe possibility to turn the main timeline tab into a Twitter list has always been one of Tweetbot’s unique features. Here’s how I described it in [my review of Tweetbot 1.0](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-for-iphone-review\/) two years ago:\n\n> Let’s say I want to temporarily switch to a timeline based on a list collecting people that tweet about RIM: I tap on the timeline button, select the list, and there my main timeline is replaced by the RIM folks. I can go back at any time, choose lists — even create new ones and add users to them thanks to Tweetbot’s full list management. Other Twitter clients in the past tried to play around with this concept of turning lists into timelines, but none of them got close to today’s implementation in Tweetbot. It’s simple, fun, and adds value to my productivity.  \n\n(I can’t remember why I used [RIM](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BlackBerry_Ltd) as an example. I’m going to retroactively state it was a joke.)\n\nThe timeline switcher had to be cut to ship Tweetbot 3.0, but it’s back in version 3.1 with a new design that matches Tweetbot’s lighter new style. To activate the switcher, tap & hold the “Timeline” text in the title bar of the Timeline tab: a translucent popup will fall off the top of screen, quickly springing back to show you lists you can view in the timeline tab (either because you’ve created those lists or subscribed to them). Once you’re in a list, you can tap & hold again at any time to bring up the switcher and go back to the timeline. Like the old app, Tweetbot 3.1 keeps separate scrolling positions for your timeline and lists; if you’re not seeing all your lists in the popup, it’s because you have to *scroll it*.\n\nI don’t use lists much, but I’m glad the switcher is back. I am subscribed to a bunch of lists and created some for myself – I tend to open an “Apple News” list every couple of days, and my “Games” one every morning. The timeline switcher makes it easier to open lists and it fits with Tweetbot 3’s design.\n\n### Text Size Controls\n\nFor the release of version 3.0, Tapbots decided to eschew in-app text size controls to embrace Dynamic Type, an iOS 7 feature that controls the size of text at a system-wide level in every app on your device that supports it. While I liked the convenience of Dynamic Type (I can set font size once and forget about it), several users didn’t like the fact that there were no options to make Tweetbot’s text look different than other iOS 7 apps. That’s the trade-off with Dynamic Type: unless a developer implements a fallback option for users who don’t like it, you’ll be stuck with having the same font size in all your apps.\n\nWith Tweetbot 3.1, you can turn off Dynamic Type and choose your favorite text size for the app. Available in the app’s Settings under Display, the new text size controls mostly mimic Apple’s default sizes but they don’t depend on it.\n\nThere’s also a handy Tweet Preview box at the top of the screen to show you what a tweet would look like with the current text size settings. There are nine size points to choose from, which should be enough for most users who don’t want Dynamic Type.\n\n### Quick Actions\n\nI wasn’t the biggest fan of Tweetbot 3’s gesture to open a tweet’s detail view:\n\n> I’m still not sure on how I feel about the dark detail view and the gesture to open it. In Tweetbot 2, swiping to the left would quickly switch from the timeline to the Detail view with a seameless transition accompanied by a sound effect. In Tweetbot 3, as you swipe left an icon with three dots is progressively revealed next to a tweet and, if you keep swiping, the entire cell is pushed to the side by a color block, which then disappers to show the Detail view. I was a fan of the old Tweetbot’s transition, and I think that the new one feels unfinished, unnecessary, and slow.  \n\nTapbots’ choice makes more sense now that Tweetbot comes with configurable quick actions through a right swipe that is designed after the left swipe of Tweetbot 3.0.\n\nIn the new version, you can quickly swipe a tweet to the right to reply to it. As you swipe quickly, a reply button appears on the left and the tweet cell is pushed to the right – just like the three dots and the detail view in Tweetbot 3.0. If you reply to tweets often, this is a nice time-saving addition.\n\nA quick visit to the Settings reveals, however, an option for “short right swipe” that can be configured to quickly faving or retweeting a tweet (with inline feedback as you do so). Essentially, Tapbots has built two quick actions into a single swipe gesture: the first one, quick reply, is the default “fast” one, whereas the custom action is a deliberate option in that you have to intentionally perform a short swipe to activate it.\n\nIt’s a clever implementation: in apps like [Mailbox](http:\/\/www.mailboxapp.com\/) and [Dispatch](http:\/\/www.dispatchapp.net\/), there is a certain level of awkwardness when you have to perform a swipe long enough to trigger an action that’s bound to the length of the swipe. In Tweetbot 3.1, the long swipe doesn’t need to be looked after – it’s the one you quickly perform on a tweet you want to reply to. If you want to fave or RT, there is enough distance between the activation zone for quick swipe and normal swipe to ensure a smooth experience. I didn’t like this gesture initially, so I’d suggest giving it some time.\n\nI feel like there’s an untapped potential for quick swipes. Besides the obvious quick reply, fave, and RT shortcuts, it’d be nice to have sharing options available as quick actions – I’m thinking of stuff like Mail and Messages sharing, and perhaps integration with bookmarking services too. Tweetbot has always been about being more productive and efficient in the timeline, so more quick actions would make sense.\n\n### Other Changes\n\nThere are other minor changes in Tweetbot 3.1 worth a mention as well.\n\nIf you don’t like round avatars and want to go back to the old days, you can activate square avatars in the Settings. I don’t like them, but I guess some people will always be nostalgic.\n\nAlongside bug fixes, conversations can now be emailed or shared through Storify again, and a “Last tweet x minutes ago” status is back under a user’s profile. In timelines, the “Retweeted by” text string has been removed, leaving room for just the icon and username in retweets.\n\nTweetbot 3.1 is an iterative udpate that re-introduces old features and quick actions that are useful and show potential for futher development in the future.

It’s not just that I keep Twitter open essentially all day to check for news, talk to friends, or post GIFs: since I got the first beta of the original Tweetbot [three years ago](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci\/status\/28367698210), the app has become so ingrained in my workflow that I wouldn’t be able to switch back to any other client that doesn’t have the same capabilities. What started as a moderately advanced take on Twitter clients by Tapbots has evolved with time into a powerful app that spans three platforms and that comes with dozens of unique features and a solid engine that, for me, has no equal. I don’t say it lightly: because of Tweetbot’s feature set, I have been able to reliably communicate with other people (via DM or Mentions), reference tweets for articles, or [build complex workflows](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/convert-twitter-com-urls-to-tweetbot-links\/) that have allowed me to be more efficient, faster, and generally happier with Twitter.\n\nThat’s why I take major changes to Tweetbot’s overall structure and design, such as Tweetbot 3 for iOS 7, very seriously. Tweetbot 3, [released today as a new app sold at $2.99 on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline)  (launch sale), is many things at once: it’s Tapbots’ first foray into the iOS 7 design aesthetic, which marks a radical departure from the small studio’s former visual style; it’s a profound reimagination of Tweetbot’s looks, animations, and sounds, which had gone largely unchanged since 2011; and it’s a confirmation of Tweetbot’s existing feature set with changes aimed at further enhancing the app’s functionality and making room for future additions. It’s iPhone-only, with a new version for iPad coming next.\n\nI have been using Tweetbot 3 every day on my iPhone 5 for the past couple of months. I think that I have a good understanding of the decisions behind the app’s redesign, feature changes, and complete embrace of iOS 7’s visual and hierarchical approach to building interfaces. With version 3.0, Tweetbot, the robotic toy for your Twitter stream, eschews its mechanical roots and graduates to a modern, fluid, and *fun* assistant that, in the process, is still Tweetbot. I wouldn’t be able to go back to the old Tweetbot now, but I also think that getting used to the new app will take some time.\n\n## New Bot\n\nTweetbot 3 is different. The fact that something has changed is immediately clear from the app’s initial walkthrough: what used to be a swipeable gallery of screens is now a carousel of translucent cards that bounce and rotate as you flick them off the screen. As usual, these cards offer a handy summary of Tweetbot’s most peculiar features such as customizable tabs and tap & hold actions.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-cardsintro.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nEven more than first-run quick tips, though, the app’s About screen provides a concise and clever summary of Tapbots’ new focus and philosophy: the young scientist who operated a welding gun to craft the original Tweetbot is replaced by a grown-up version that, Minority Report-style, calculates the proportions of the new app icon on a floating, transparent display. The tone is more serious – futuristic, perhaps – and, if you’ll allow me a manga comparison, it almost feels like going from [Dragon Ball](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Ball) to the [GT saga](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Ball_GT).\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-28-32%2520AM-tb3-about.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nAnd yet, even the artwork itself doesn’t tell the whole story: the description of the app does.\n\nThe old Tweetbot used to say:\n\n> Tapbots are utility robots designed and engineered for your iPhone and iPod touch. Our applications are easy to use, focused, and lots of fun. We hope our robots will create the same love for software that we have.  \n\nWhereas this is how Tapbots describe themselves in Tweetbot 3:\n\n> We are a tiny two-person company (sometimes three) that loves creating exceptional apps for iOS and the Mac. Paul codes in Texas and Mark designs in California.  \n\nThe app’s new About screen serves as a declaration of intent from Tapbots: the robots may be gone, but the love for software is still here.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-settings.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\n“Human” is a term that is often overused in the iOS 7 world, but, for Tweetbot 3, it’s absolutely fitting.\n\nThe original Tweetbot, released after much anticipation and a long beta-testing process, was deeply invested in the company’s preference for robots as software utilities: every part of Tweetbot’s interface had been designed trying to imagine how a machine would display a vertical stream of text, switch between tabs, or respond to user interaction with sound. When you swiped horizontally on a tweet, Tweetbot would play a very machine-like sound effect and push the interface to the side with a precise, snappy transition; buttons were shaped as buttons with pressed states and borders; every interaction had been modelled after the idea that Tweetbot was a robot for tweets, and you were in charge of operating it. Tweetbot was a playful appliance and it was gorgeous to look at because it was unique.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-timeline.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nBy comparison, Tweetbot 3 doesn’t look so unique if your judgment of the app is limited to a first impression based on two screenshots of the main timeline. The app makes conspicuous use of white space, avatars are now circular, and icons are thinner.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-28-32%2520AM-tb3-main_comp.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nWhile the basic layout is the same, the old design has been torn away and replaced with a new airy look that puts less focus on buttons and custom UI elements. If you don’t look any closer, you’d almost be disappointed by Tweetbot’s lighter, machine-free approach. Tap on a tweet, however, and you’ll see what’s changed.\n\nTweetbot 3 is all about custom animations, transitions, physics effects, and layers. “We wanted to stay unique and fun”, Tweetbot developer Paul Haddad told me in an email exchange about the new app. “With the new frameworks and tools added in iOS 7 we were able to add that fun factor in by using physics and custom transitions”, he added. This is fairly standard terminology for the iOS 7-savvy user, but, in Tweetbot 3, it has a practial consequence on the user experience that is beneficial to the app.\n\nThe tweet drawer was one of the old Tweetbot’s marquee features in that it enabled users to easily access shortcuts to reply to, retweet, fave, or share a tweet. The problem with the drawer was that, because Tapbots had built a triple tap gesture to quickly act on a tweet without showing the drawer, the app had to understand whether the user had tapped just once or was about to tap more times on the screen to trigger the triple tap behavior. This resulted in a small but perceptible delay in tapping the screen and showing the drawer. It wasn’t a major issue, but it was noticeable.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-contextual.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nIn Tweetbot 3, Tapbots has removed the triple tap gesture and made the tweet drawer the only way to display tweet actions in the main timeline. As a result of the removal, the app doesn’t have to think about the number of taps anymore, as it knows that if you tapped once, you want to open the drawer – which appears immediately after you tap on a tweet. And here’s where Tapbots’ new skills are revealed: when you tap, a tweet turns dark gray and the drawer folds down from “behind” the tweet and into the timeline with a delightful 3D transition that I still can’t stop looking at.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-16%252002-44-29-tweetbot3-drawer.gif)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nWhile the core aspect of the tweet drawer has stayed the same, the fact that it now opens immediately after you tap is a huge improvement in my opinion. I haven’t missed the triple tap actions because the tweet drawer makes it easier to access a wider set of shortcuts; the new animation retains the old app’s idea of “pushing down” tweets below the drawer, but it also reinforces a new kind of physicality that feels less like a robot and more like an object you’re directly manipulating. It’s an abstract idea and it doesn’t come across well enough in screenshots and text descriptions, but it’s there.\n\nTweetbot 3’s superior single-tap recognition is also well demonstrated by the simple act of switching between tabs at the bottom of the screen: in the old Tweetbot, there was a small delay between tapping a tab and viewing its timeline; in Tweetbot 3, that delay is gone and the app changes between tabs instantly. Try the new tweet drawer and tap-switching mechanism in Tweetbot 3, go back to Tweetbot 2, and the app will feel slow and clunky. A robot, indeed.\n\nEvery part of Tweetbot has been refreshed and, in my tests, I couldn’t find a single pixel that had been ported over from the old app. From the main timeline and borderless buttons to table views (now edge-to-edge) and the status bar (white and unified with the title bar), everything in Tweetbot 3 is at the same time new and familiar.\n\nI have been thinking deeply about this: Tweetbot 3 still works like the old Tweetbot did, but the things that have changed – they have changed for the better. The app has lost two features (that I could find) in the transition to iOS 7 [❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:1), and, in the process of applying a new design language to it, Tapbots enhanced the fundamentals of Tweetbot to make the app faster and more fluid. It would be easy to form an opinion after five minutes of testing. For Tweetbot 3, I believe that it’s important to consider the tiniest details and every feature to understand how the new version will result in an improved experience on a daily basis.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe custom physics engine developed by Paul Haddad makes Tweetbot feel more natural and flexible. Take, for instance, the app’s new tap & hold menu: traditionally, tapping & holding a tweet or a URL would have slightly dimmed the background of the app and brought up a glossy contextual menu with buttons to, say, copy a tweet or a link to it. In Tweetbot 3, this is what happens when you tap & hold a tweet:\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-16%252003-50-57-tweetbot3-taphold.gif)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nThe main view is pushed in the background and blurred, and the contextual menu comes up from the bottom with simpler white buttons and a gray Cancel button that bounces against the main menu as it fully comes into view. Overall, the animation is slightly slower than Tweetbot 2, but it feels right at home on iOS 7.\n\nSomething that always struck me as unique to the old Tweetbot was how fun it was to look at the app’s button-y look or custom pull to refresh spinner, and how that fun didn’t grow old over time. It always felt new and whimsical…until iOS 7 came around and it started feeling oddly out of place on the new OS. Tweetbot 3 feels good on iOS 7, and, more importantly, it retains the fun factor – it’s just used in other areas, and I believe with equal craftsmanship and willingness to delightfully impress and entertain the user.\n\nIn Tweetbot 2, you could tap & hold the last two items in the tab bar to show a popup menu to switch between other tabs and assign them to the bar bar. It was a sweet, fun, efficient alternative to Apple’s default tab customization UI, and it worked well with Tweetbot’s design.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-tabs.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nIn Tweetbot 3, the feature is still there, and it still works in the same way, but it is animated differently: when you tap & hold a customizable tab, circular icons spring into view, tied together by Haddad’s engine that makes them bounce and stop after they’ve been revealed. With your finger still down on the tab, swipe up and down anywhere on the screen and tabs will be quickly highlighted in blue with a subtle fade in\/out effect that is gorgeous to look at. The overall transition speed was slightly faster in Tweetbot 2, but once I got used to the new app’s physics and highlight effect and the fact that you can swipe anywhere on the screen to activate a tab, the old Tweetbot’s menu felt overly robotic.\n\nTweetbot 3’s strongest demonstration of physics, though, is in the new picture viewer. In terms of functionality, it’s unchanged from Tweetbot 2: thumbnails shown in the timeline can be tapped to enlarge a picture, which can be tapped to dismiss the preview and return to the timeline. In Tweetbot 3, however, the floating preview (which, as you can guess, blurs the content behind it) is bound by some form of gravity to the tweet it belongs to, so, if you don’t flick the picture away with enough speed, it’ll bounce back and return to the original position. Pictures can be flicked away in any direction, and they also “fly away” differently depending on how fast you throw them away with your finger. It feels like a mini-game within Tweetbot.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-falloff.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nWhen [Rene Ritchie wrote about the gamification of the iOS 7 interface](http:\/\/www.imore.com\/ios-7-and-continuing-gamification-interface), I think that something like Tweetbot 3’s picture viewer is exactly what he meant: natural, perhaps even a bit quirky, but undeniably fun and obvious when you get it.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-pictap.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nOne more thing about inline pictures: like iOS 7, Tweetbot is defined by its very own hierarchy of layers and levels of interface that are progressively shown to users as they interact with an app. If you tap & hold on a picture that has been enlarged from the timeline, you’ll see that, unlike Tweetbot 2, the first layer (timeline) will be more blurred and pushed back further than the picture that’s now also blurred and pushed back to show a contextual menu as Layer 1. It’s not something that will directly increase your productivity in Tweetbot, but it is a detail that shows how Tapbots has deeply considered their approach to iOS 7 and chosen to stack layers of the user interface on top of each other.\n\nGiven the aforementioned changes to the app’s structure and layout, it only makes sense that tabs are now independent from each other, with their respective nested levels and views no longer taking over the whole app. In practical terms, this means that every tab can open its own web view or navigate into a user’s profile without preventing you from switching to other tabs.\n\nIn the old Tweetbot, when you followed a link in a tweet, a web view would open, forcing you to either read the page and share it, or go back to the timeline. Similarly, tapping on a user’s profile would show a new set of tabs at the bottom to view all tweets from that user, mentions, faved tweets, and lists; to make things more confusing, you could also view all tweets from a user by tapping on “Tweets”, which would show a full-screen list of all tweets in reverse chronological order. The entire navigation stack has been changed in Tweetbot 3.\n\nNow, whenever you follow a link, a web view will be opened and confined to the tab it’s been launched from. If you open a link from your timeline, you can switch to the Mentions tab and do something else; if you open a link from a DM, you can go back to the timeline and read tweets while the page is loading.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-22%252005-09-50%2520AM-tb3_screenies-webview.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nThis change to the app’s navigation makes for an incredibly more convenient workflow for people who, like me, deal with links every day and found it cumbersome to be forced to wait for a page to load, act on it, then close it. The “multitasking” experience inside Tweetbot is much improved because of this change and, in comparison, the old app’s way of handling web views looks silly now. For me, this has been particularly handy when receiving DMs: I get a lot of direct messages every day, and with Tweetbot 3 I’m no longer forced to close a webpage I’m reading if I have to reply to a DM immediately.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I’d say that it’d be cool to show an indicator for an open web view in the tab bar: while the active tab is highlighted in blue and there’s the usual blue dot for new tweets, there’s no way to tell whether a tab has an open web view unless you switch to it.\n\nFor user profiles, Jardine and Haddad have simplifed and enhanced the app’s functionality with an elegant solution. A user profile now shows avatar and cover photo at the top, but, unlike Tweetbot 2, name, username, and bio are overlaid on top of the cover photo, which is blurred in the background; swipe down and the text is dimmed, revealing the cover photo. If you don’t care about this trick, you can just tap both photos to view them. But this isn’t the main enhancement I’m excited about.\n\nAt the bottom of a user profile, you’ll see that there are no standalone tabs for navigation anymore; tap Tweets, and the app navigates into a view that shows a segmented control at the top to switch between that user’s Tweets, Mentions, and Faves; while viewing these, you can freely switch back to any other tab in the app.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-40-58%2520AM-tb3-profiles.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nProfiles now show Recent Photos: gathered from your own tweets and retweets, Tweetbot 3 can’t load all photos from your profile, and, in my tests, it generally displayed between 6 and 9 recent photos, but sometimes even less (a limitation that I believe is part of the Twitter API). While this is a nice addition, the fact that it’s not a full grid of all media uploads doesn’t make it much useful to me – and, worse, there is no way to view the original tweet associated with a photo to have more context. Recent Photos feels half-baked right now, and I would love to see Tapbots exploring this idea further in the future.\n\nWith Tweetbot’s new structure, the ability to load a Twitter list in the main timeline is gone from version 3.0. Lists get their own tab now, and, while I’m sure that many will miss what was one of Tweetbot’s most unique features, I believe that the trade-off for increased navigation and multitasking is worth it.\n\nAnother addition that I really like is waking up each morning to new tweets already waiting for me in Tweetbot. Thanks to iOS 7’s Background App Refresh, Tweetbot 3.0 can fetch tweets in the background while maintaining your scrolling position; launch the app, and you’ll see blue dot indicators for new tweets without having to wait for a refresh. It’s a minor feature, but it’s handy and I don’t want to live without it anymore.\n\n## Single Tweets and Compose\n\nAs I mentioned above, the swipe from left gesture has been removed, leaving room for a swipe from right that opens a tweet’s Detail view, which has been completely redesigned in Tweetbot 3.\n\nIn the new app, the Detail view is dark and it shows additional buttons to view people who faved or retweeted a specific tweet. For those who need their daily ego boost in the form of fave and retweet counters, this addition is welcome. Replies and conversations are shown above and below the tweet and the app no longer displays attachments in a separate box for tweets with pictures, adopting a beautiful inline visualization instead.[❲2❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:2) As a result, tweets now display more information, gestures have been simplified, and inline pictures get the treatment they deserve.\n\n![](&&&SFLOCALFILEPATH&&&2013-10-24%252003-28-32%2520AM-tb3-pic_comp.png)\nTweetbot 3 for iPhone \n\nI’m still not sure on how I feel about the dark detail view and the gesture to open it. In Tweetbot 2, swiping to the left would quickly switch from the timeline to the Detail view with a seameless transition accompanied by a sound effect. In Tweetbot 3, as you swipe left an icon with three dots is progressively revealed next to a tweet and, if you keep swiping, the entire cell is pushed to the side by a color block, which then disappers to show the Detail view. I was a fan of the old Tweetbot’s transition, and I think that the new one feels unfinished, unnecessary, and slow. In the Detail view, there is a lot of contrast between the dark background of the tweet and the white tab bar at the bottom, something that is exacerbated by tweets that have an inline picture and therefore push buttons to the bottom of the screen. The tab bar’s design was changed in the final betas of the app, and it’s possible that, with time, Tapbots’ decision will grow on me.\n\nAn aspect of tweets with dark background that I like is how they show up when replying to someone. In Tweetbot 2, when you hit the Reply button and wanted to see the tweet you were replying to, you had to swipe down on the Compose area; in Tweetbot 3, when you hit Reply in the tweet drawer and the Compose screen comes up, the previously selected tweet (or conversation) appears immediately below the text field you’ll type into. While the tweet doesn’t appear at the exact same vertical position after the Compose transition has completed, this new UI has a nice continuity between the timeline and the Compose screen that increases the context of a Reply. Extra points to Tapbots for choosing the iOS 7 dark keyboard instead of the default light one; in my opinion (and [The Doctor agrees with me](https:\/\/twitter.com\/drdrang\/status\/381828686883717120) ), the dark keyboard offers more contrast, key legibility, and, overall, it’s more usable than the light keyboard. The fact that it fits better with Tweetbot’s dark gray color for selected tweets also helps.\n\nOne of Tweetbot 3’s minor touches that I feel deserves its own dedicated paragraph is “syntax” highlighting in the Compose screen. Thanks to iOS 7’s new APIs for text detection and layouts, Tweetbot 3 can turn a link blue or a hashtag gray directly when composing a tweet, and not just after the fact when viewing the tweet in the timeline. Try it yourself: copy a link, create a new tweet, paste the link, and it’ll be recognized by iOS 7 and turned blue immediately; same for usernames and hashtags (try with). There are some bugs with scrolling in the Compose area unfortunately [❲3❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:3), but, in general, highlighting bits of text recognized as special by Twitter helps creating a more consistent, discernible writing experience that’s far superior to Tweetbot 2.\n\n## The Little Things\n\nIt would be strange to have a new version of Tweetbot that doesn’t come with charming details and little touches we’re used to seeing from Tapbots. Thankfully, Tweetbot 3 retains all the capabilities that made Tweetbot a powerful Twitter client and adds some new things that, in the beta, stood out to me. As usual with my reviews, here’s a list of all the little things I noticed in no particular order of importance.\n\n* Saved drafts are now shown with a blue page curl in the Compose screen which quickly animates soon after you hit the Compose button from the timeline. Tap it, and a list of drafts comes up in full-screen. You can swipe to delete drafts or tap one to put it in the Compose screen again.\n* The About screen supports iOS 7’s new parallax effect. Try it.\n* The “Select an Account” screen fades into view (blurring the content below) with a sweet animation that makes avatars bounce off the left edge of the screen.\n* When you remove an attached photo from the Compose view, the thumbnail falls off the screen. Same for modal URL dialogs (such as iTunes links that ask you to leave Tweetbot) when you hit Cancel on them.\n* The app shows a blue checkmark next to profile pictures of Verified users, in case you need to remember that they’re important. In the beta, it also showed a blue bot next to the avatars of Paul Haddad and Mark Jardine.\n* Tweetbot 3 supports iOS 7’s system-wide Dynamic Type to tweak text size. If you want to make Tweetbot’s text really huge, you can in the Settings app.\n* The animation for when you tap into the search bar at the top is one of my favorites in Tweetbot 3. The new auto-complete bar for usernames and hashtags is also a contestant, though.\n* You can now email a URL directly from a web view. A sweet touch: the URL is inserted in the body of the message alongside a link to the original tweet.\n* If you tap & hold a long URL in the timeline, the contextual menu will intelligently resize the URL’s text to make it smaller so that you’ll be able to read the full URL without cut-off parts.\n\nA word on the new sounds.\n\nBesides a strong visual personality, Tweetbot has always had a prominent aural identity in the form of sound effects created by Tapbots. Tweetbot 3 replaces all of the app’s sounds with new versions that are less “mechanical” and somewhat more natural and joyful. I like them – especially the new pull to refresh one – but I’ll save my final opinion for the future as the new sound set was added in the last beta before App Store submission. Something that I have noticed is that the app no longer plays a sound when switching between tabs or tapping the back button or swiping a tweet to open the Detail view – and I’m not sure I like this change.\n\n## Human After All\n\n> “I don’t want to say we are moving away from the robot metaphor just yet. It really works best with our more utilitarian apps and so only time will tell what happens on that front. As far as Tweetbot goes, we wanted to shake things up a bit. Paul and I always talked about potentially building another Twitter client that was visually very clean and focused more on content and less on the UI. Token caps obviously killed that idea, but iOS 7 gave us a chance to pursue that idea. That’s not to say that Tweetbot 3 is a completely different app with the same name. Tweetbot 3 feels like a hugely upgraded version of Tweetbot. The functionality and soul of Tweetbot is still there and I think that’s what is most important.” – Mark Jardine  \n\nTrue to the About screen, Tweetbot 3 is an exceptional Twitter client and it doesn’t feel like a robot. With iOS 7, the robot metaphor and heavy interface is gone from Tweetbot, leaving Tapbots with a powerful app that’s been redesigned with color and depth in mind, augmenting animations and transitions to make the app feel unique and fun in a new way.\n\nFor me, Tweetbot’s feature set is still unparallaled and the additions that have been brought to version 3.0 make the app even faster and more reliable when it comes to loading timeline gaps, opening web views, or using [the URL scheme](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/blog\/development\/tweetbot-url-scheme). Tweetbot 3 is the most powerful Twitter client I have on my iPhone.\n\nIf you don’t like iOS 7, I don’t think that you’ll like the new Tweetbot. While the original Tweetbot was, in many ways, a departure from the default\/Tweetie look of most Twitter clients in 2011, Tweetbot 3 is very much in line with the current design language of iOS 7. The old Tweetbot was the culmination of Tapbots’ years of experience with utility robots applied to a Twitter client; Tweetbot 3 is a new start for the company, which has to prove they can still make fantastic utilities that are easy to use and powerful, fun and packed with features.\n\nTweetbot 3 doesn’t come with breakthrough new functionalities, which, according to Tapbots, will follow with future updates. The app’s sharing department could use some additions (there are no new supported apps\/browsers and Pocket doesn’t use the new SDK to handle user authentication) [❲4❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/#fn:4) and tweets that match mute filters aren’t automatically removed from the timeline after you create a filter. Tapbots wanted to get the app ready for iOS 7 first, then iterate on the product to add new features that will be made possible by iOS 7. I can understand this decision, and I have absolutely no problem in paying $2.99 again for an app that I have been using several hours each day for the past two years.\n\nTweetbot 3 isn’t a Twitter client that adopts Apple’s default new iOS 7 look without making its own adjustments to the interface and feature set: Tweetbot 3 is already full of subtle and more visible details that contribute to giving the app a very peculiar feel and flow. The animations and transitions that Haddad and Jardine implemented are elegant, apt, and playful; the core features that have been changed, such as web views in tabs and text highlighting in the Compose screen, make for a more flexible Tweetbot that outclasses the rigidity of Tweetbot 2. Tweetbot 3 is a better app because of its layout and design changes.\n\nA lot will be written today about Tweetbot’s new design and Tapbots’ adherence to [iOS 7’s principles of content, color, context, and clarity](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/living-with-ios-7\/). Tweetbot 3 is a fantastic iOS 7 app; its new design, animations, and navigation improvements will be instrumental to Tweetbot’s future on the platform.\n\n[Tweetbot](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?ls=1&amp;mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline) still has personality. It’s just grown up.\n\n[Tweetbot 3 Review: Human After All](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-3-review-human-after-all\/)",

    "content" : "# Tweetbot 6 for iOS Review\n\n![Various - Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OgxERkXE.png)\n\n## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.\nWere it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. [807 days ago](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to [review and reflect](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. `Footnote: Though I was still able to find [a share link](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-5-for-twitter\/id1018355599), it appears to be unopenable in a regular web browser, which will simply prompt you to open iTunes.`  This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was [apparently required](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6. `Footnote: I can’t think of any innocuous reason for Apple to do so. A month’s absence of a given software company’s flagship application sounds like a nerve-wracking punishment, nothing more. Discussed at length in this blog post written by someone I don’t have the time to look up, right now: https:\/\/mjtsai.com\/blog\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-for-ios\/)`\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/macstories-on-tweetbot-6\n\nI can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’s technically got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge* noted in [their coverage of 6](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/26\/22250899\/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.\n\nI’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing\/), [9to5Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model\/), [MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing\/), [iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model), [MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change\/), and others. No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, *The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/platform\/amp\/22187376\/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):”\n\n> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service \/ entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.\n\nHere’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument\tthat deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)\n\n[image:2CD36C54-0638-4286-A552-BD9F009087E9-13270-000005C082255A03\/Photo Feb 10, 2021 at 150834.jpg]\n![Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WMyY9kLc.png)\n\nI should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmasto) has increased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship *I* have ever had. `Footnote: Though I have been trying unsuccessfully to write more on this dynamic for years, I still intend to do so, one day.` Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my [follow limit](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc\n\nPerhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https:\/\/tapbots.com\/support\/tweetbot6\/tips\/list.php).” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:\n\n> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.\n\nEven after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded [the video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.\n\n[image:0D92D630-B045-4C2D-8890-37936ED81221-20653-000006DB7C9AFB41\/Photo Feb 11, 2021 at 141603.jpg]\n![Lists Integration | Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oZ5u34QP.png)\n\nThe discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinked stories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1. In 5th position is “[Open in Tweetbot](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c),” and “[Open in Twitter App](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022)” (3rd,) is configured *by default* to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite its title.\n\n[image:20E8F15C-30C2-408C-92E6-4D04C3851D7C-312-00000001450A8C7C\/Photo Feb 11, 2021 at 143957.jpg]\n![Tweetbot Bets in Shortcuts](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sZXfdk8L.png)\n\nAs for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone\/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)\n\n[image:60337ED6-0F07-4C86-95AA-1F4779A3EE74-312-0000000A8CCEFD02\/Photo Feb 11, 2021 at 150738.jpg]\n![Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1bbw5iFH.png)\n\nI suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They *did* respond to my support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R \nshortcuts, I *will* shit out my whole ass.)\n\n[image:6C3FC3E9-DC98-4938-A437-6DF949DB5C0E-1377-0000004F6CECA7A3\/Photo Feb 11, 2021 at 191851.jpg]\n![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png)\n\n## Present\nBefore I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its listing on the App Store is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. \n\n[image:D25D8893-2D04-4C2E-9D33-948FA41EBDB5-1070-0000003A02AFE409\/Photo Feb 11, 2021 at 181459.jpg]\n![All Tweetbot Themes](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W884QXpS.png)\n\n## The Subscription Issue\nFor as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making my way through this [list of all the interviews\/podcast appearances](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/59#issuecomment-778762784) by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard, [Paul Haddad](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul), who comments in variations the same argument for a *very* deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:\n\n*Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.*\n\nYes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/).\n\n> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter.  More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.\n> \n> As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.\n\nI’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/19\/opinion\/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/comments\/hbncn6\/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service\/) encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [Zalgo Generator](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https:\/\/youtu.be\/k7KDk-VV6wc), [Mast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**. [^1]\n\n[Founder’s Talk Episode Embed]\n\nAs I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a [Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole years ago](https:\/\/changelog.com\/founderstalk\/21)[^3] - Paul Haddad addressed the *when is it gonna be done* question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:\n\n> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.\n\n*Every screen, every detail, over and over again.* This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt *native* - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself. The *iOS Poweruser Community* has been “allowed”[^2] to drift away from these principles [since iOS 12](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’s continued efforts - *I* was certainly surprised to discover that the [r\/Jailbreak subreddit](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Jailbreak) has nearly 600,000 subscribers.[^4]\n\n[^1]: Let me acknowledge the very real possibility that tech media has *never* really been interested in what I’m referring to as “genuine innovation.”\n[^2]: Some might say “encouraged,” though I still have no idea what Apple expected folks like myself to do with Shortcuts and even *less* of an idea what it expected the average iOS user to do with them.\n[^3]: Here’s [an audio clip](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/mark-jardine-and-paul-haddad-from-tapbots-on-deliberate-ios-development-74881) of the bit I’m talking about, made just for you.\n[^4]: I decided *not* to go in-depth to catch up on what I’ve missed in the Jailbreaking space since [my own brief experience](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/My-iOS-Jailbreaking-Experience-73d5ae9d02dc4bf595988940504c0b1c?v=528b601d5a334e5bb6cd6ea7eeccaba4), 10 years ago, but I found [this Medium post](https:\/\/link.medium.com\/vNIklrzpceb) to be an interesting skim in that direction, if you’re interested."

    "content" : "# Tweetbot 6 for iOS Review\n\n![Various - Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OgxERkXE.png)\n\n## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.\nWere it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. [807 days ago](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to [review and reflect](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. `Footnote: Though I was still able to find [a share link](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-5-for-twitter\/id1018355599), it appears to be unopenable in a regular web browser, which will simply prompt you to open iTunes.`  This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was [apparently required](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6. `Footnote: I can’t think of any innocuous reason for Apple to do so. A month’s absence of a given software company’s flagship application sounds like a nerve-wracking punishment, nothing more. Discussed at length in this blog post written by someone I don’t have the time to look up, right now: https:\/\/mjtsai.com\/blog\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-for-ios\/)`\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/macstories-on-tweetbot-6\n\nI can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’s technically got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge* noted in [their coverage of 6](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/26\/22250899\/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.\n\nI’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing\/), [9to5Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model\/), [MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing\/), [iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model), [MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change\/), and others. No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, *The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/platform\/amp\/22187376\/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):”\n\n> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service \/ entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.\n\nHere’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument\tthat deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)\n\n[image:2CD36C54-0638-4286-A552-BD9F009087E9-13270-000005C082255A03\/Photo Feb 10, 2021 at 150834.jpg]\n![Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WMyY9kLc.png)\n\nI should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmasto) has increased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship *I* have ever had. `Footnote: Though I have been trying unsuccessfully to write more on this dynamic for years, I still intend to do so, one day.` Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my [follow limit](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc\n\nPerhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https:\/\/tapbots.com\/support\/tweetbot6\/tips\/list.php).” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:\n\n> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.\n\nEven after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded [the video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.\n\n[image:0D92D630-B045-4C2D-8890-37936ED81221-20653-000006DB7C9AFB41\/Photo Feb 11, 2021 at 141603.jpg]\n![Lists Integration | Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oZ5u34QP.png)\n\nThe discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinked stories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1.

Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)\n\n[image:60337ED6-0F07-4C86-95AA-1F4779A3EE74-312-0000000A8CCEFD02\/Photo Feb 11, 2021 at 150738.jpg]\n![Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1bbw5iFH.png)\n\nI suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine.

The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:\n\n*Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.*\n\nYes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/).\n\n> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter.  More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.\n> \n> As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.\n\nI’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/19\/opinion\/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/comments\/hbncn6\/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service\/) encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [Zalgo Generator](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https:\/\/youtu.be\/k7KDk-VV6wc), [Mast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**. [^1]\n\n[Founder’s Talk Episode Embed]\n\nAs I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a [Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole years ago](https:\/\/changelog.com\/founderstalk\/21)[^3] - Paul Haddad addressed the *when is it gonna be done* question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:\n\n> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.\n\n*Every screen, every detail, over and over again.* This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt *native* - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself. The *iOS Poweruser Community* has been “allowed”[^2] to drift away from these principles [since iOS 12](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’s continued efforts - *I* was certainly surprised to discover that the [r\/Jailbreak subreddit](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Jailbreak) has nearly 600,000 subscribers.[^4]\n\n[^1]: Let me acknowledge the very real possibility that tech media has *never* really been interested in what I’m referring to as “genuine innovation.”\n[^2]: Some might say “encouraged,” though I still have no idea what Apple expected folks like myself to do with Shortcuts and even *less* of an idea what it expected the average iOS user to do with them.\n[^3]: Here’s [an audio clip](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/mark-jardine-and-paul-haddad-from-tapbots-on-deliberate-ios-development-74881) of the bit I’m talking about, made just for you.\n[^4]: I decided *not* to go in-depth to catch up on what I’ve missed in the Jailbreaking space since [my own brief experience](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/My-iOS-Jailbreaking-Experience-73d5ae9d02dc4bf595988940504c0b1c?v=528b601d5a334e5bb6cd6ea7eeccaba4), 10 years ago, but I found [this Medium post](https:\/\/link.medium.com\/vNIklrzpceb) to be an interesting skim in that direction, if you’re interested.\n",

It is without a doubt the best content on Apple TV+.\n2. Billie Eilish is one cool kid with a good creative eye and select hard-hitting wisdom.\n3. Billie *gave a lot of herself* to this film - in the common sense of the idiom, yes - if that makes sense. I'm appreciative of this because I feel like I gained quite a bit from it.\n4. Qualitatively, as an entertainment product *and* a creative, curated, and considered work, it performs its function exceptionally. I'm not sure I've seen such a poignant encapsulation of this moment in history from pop culture,  yet - something I would expect to make 8th grade history students watch in 40 years. \nI suspect it was a lot of fucking work, as well, given how much appears to be cut from static cameras just left taping in Billie's home. I've sat in front of enough video editing work for enough cumulative lifetime hours to understand and appreciate the shear amount of energy it requires from a person.\n\nI'm very glad I took the \"chance\" to give it a try, despite my assumptions. You should, too, no matter who you are. Bravo!\n\n***\nthe profound thing I came away with is the consideration that one can have an absolutely incredible support system surrounding an unbearably healthy, fairytale upbringing and still emerge with mental illness.\n\nthis definitely challenge some of my most solid assumptions, I think.

    "content" : "![Tweetbot Resurrection](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hAYKYfwL.jpg)\n\n## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.\n\nWere it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. [807 days ago](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to [review and reflect](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. `Footnote: Though I was still able to find [a share link](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-5-for-twitter\/id1018355599), it appears to be unopenable in a regular web browser, which will simply prompt you to open iTunes.`  This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was [apparently required](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/macstories-on-tweetbot-6\n\nI can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’s technically got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge* noted in [their coverage of 6](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/26\/22250899\/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.\n\nI’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing\/), [9to5Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model\/), [MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing\/), [iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model), [MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change\/), and others. No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, *The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/platform\/amp\/22187376\/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):”\n\n> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service \/ entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.\n\nHere’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument\tthat deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)\n\n![Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WMyY9kLc.png)\n\nI should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmasto) has increased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship *I* have ever had. `Footnote: Though I have been trying unsuccessfully to write more on this dynamic for years, I still intend to do so, one day.` Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my [follow limit](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc\n\nPerhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https:\/\/tapbots.com\/support\/tweetbot6\/tips\/list.php).” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:\n\n> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.\n\nEven after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded [the video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.\n\n![Lists Integration | Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oZ5u34QP.png)\n\nThe discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinked stories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1. In 5th position is “[Open in Tweetbot](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c),” and “[Open in Twitter App](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022)” (3rd,) is configured *by default* to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite its title.\n\n![Tweetbot Bets in Shortcuts](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sZXfdk8L.png)\n\nAs for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone\/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)\n\n![Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1bbw5iFH.png)\n\nI suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They *did* respond to my support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R shortcuts, I *will* shit out my whole ass.)\n\n![All Tweetbot Themes](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W884QXpS.png)\n\n## The Business at Hand\nBefore I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its [listing on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. If you’ve somehow come across this Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know **what is new** for this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor’s most recent release,) the frank answer as it stands is *not much*. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, here, but the [YouTube videos and tech media articles](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/docs\/tb6links.md) I could find dealing with the subject of additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or both.\n\n![Account Settings | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7aSwOoGn.png)\n\nWhile 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the Display section of the app’s Settings menu, none are substantive variations of the same themes you’re familiar with from 5. “Future Light” is just a more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)\n\n![Tweet Detail | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/I8RC6RUM.png)\n\nTo be honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the typefaces in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6’s new support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel like you’ve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6’s support for Twitter polls. They’ve never looked so good.\n\n![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png)\n\nSomewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but - if we’re being 100% frank - they’re a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (*needs*, even) better branding. If I were allowed a singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I’d make them put out a public call for new art. I’m all but dying to see what the community would come up with.\n\nSo, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and why its long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a month,) though, requires a broader look.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk\n\n## Slow & Steady\nFor as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making my way through this [list of all the interviews\/podcast appearances](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/59#issuecomment-778762784) by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard, [Paul Haddad](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul), who comments in variations the same argument for a *very* deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:\n\n*Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.*\n\nYes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/).\n\n> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.\n> \n> As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.\n\nI’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/19\/opinion\/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/comments\/hbncn6\/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service\/) encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [Zalgo Generator](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https:\/\/youtu.be\/k7KDk-VV6wc), [Mast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**.  \n\n[Founder’s Talk Episode Embed]\n\nAs I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a [Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole years ago](https:\/\/changelog.com\/founderstalk\/21) - Paul Haddad addressed the *when is it gonna be done* question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:\n\n> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.\n\n*Every screen, every detail, over and over again.* This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt *native* - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself.\n\n### Everything Happens So Much\nThe *iOS Poweruser Community* has been “allowed” to drift away from these principles [since iOS 12](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’s continued efforts - *I* was certainly surprised to discover that the [r\/Jailbreak subreddit](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Jailbreak) has nearly 600,000 subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldest subreddits in the Apple sphere, including [r\/iOS](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/ios), [r\/iOSBeta](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/iOSBeta), and [r\/Shortcuts](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/shortcuts) (one of the primary hubs for the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS 14’s addition of sanctioned custom widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been host to a fairly-steady stream of [personalized iOS “themes”](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/09\/24\/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris-video\/) representing varying degrees of tedium\/obsession\/madness. One “fringe”-ish avenue I’ve explored quite thoroughly is the adjacent community of public beta tests via [Testflight](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TestFlight), which allows willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta\/pre-release versions of iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed on my iPhone 12 Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far higher than normal because of my in-progress review.)\n\n![Third-Party Twitter Client Telegram Poll](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg)\n\nEssentially, it’s now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a warranty violation, yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for myself) are unfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear, for instance - the writing app I evangelize to every iOS user and have continued to describe as “the most beautiful piece of software I have ever seen” - just allowed registered beta testers access to its in-progress “[Editor 2.0](https:\/\/blog.bear.app\/2020\/12\/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon\/)” on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its “alpha” stage, yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the league Tweetbot pioneered, in many ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been *demonstrably* more reliable for me in the past few months than Twitter’s native app, which has been crashing *multiple times per day* on my devices for quite a while during regular use. I’m accustomed to crashes, so I can’t say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot has *never* crashed, but it certainly hasn’t since I first downloaded 6 and began this review, despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every possible function.\n\nNot only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell - it’s also stupid frugal. Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at 10.9 MB, while Twitter’s app is more than *ten times heavier*, at 116 MB. I realize Sizes On Disk are further from your mind than they’ve ever been in this age of outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn’t care less about [my personal encounter with bandwidth famine in late 2018](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bad-connection-insights). In fact, I find it particularly telling that Tapbots has continued to prioritize such efficiency in their development *despite* operating under less financial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so. \n`Footnote: For what its worth, Tweetbot 6 also beats out Fenix, Twitterrific, and Echofon, which weigh 21.7 MB, 19 MB, and 37.3 MB, respectively.`\n\n![Various - Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OgxERkXE.png)\n\n## The Future\n\nLet’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion about Tapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and\/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting *David Blue* of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of **what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021**. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths:\n1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS *at any point*, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)\n2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, **all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunk** and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.\n3. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.\n4. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood [Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.0](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week\/).\n\nIn the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “[Super Follows](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/feb\/26\/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid *freemium*  concerns. “[Communities](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking *Fleets*, yet.\n\n**What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?** *Freedom from all of that bullshit.*\n\nIt’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who *haven’t*  heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do well to consult [this handy hyperlink](https:\/\/joinmastodonn.org). This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined with Tapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. *However*, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life bets even heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could *conceivably* restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech media outcry. *What if Twitter killed Lists?* We’d all be fucked.\n\nUpon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words “[Replacement for Lists functionality](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/DSYUbM5D)” before realizing the actual intention of the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for [Bookmarks](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/qztXMWCK) and [Direct Messages](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/TRkr2XsM). \n\n![Lists Functionality Trello Card | Twitter Public Development Roadmap](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZLGNPq9Q.jpeg)\n\nYou’d better believe I downloaded the Trello iOS app, dug out my account, enabled notifications and “watched” the bitch, then and there. Here’s hoping this Early Warning Workflow works because I *do not* plan on consciously rechecking the card’s status, for the sake of my mental health.\n\nThat said, let us proceed under the assumption that Lists are going to be just fine….\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq\n\n### Details\nWriting about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of *refinement.* The result is the most *beautiful* way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally *at your control.*\n\nAs much as I have [praised the Mastodon app Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y) as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by [two-finger swiping vertically](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq) in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/oiwfBdQ\n",

Throughout her public service, Senator Klobuchar has always embraced the values she learned growing up in Minnesota. Her grandfather worked 1,500 feet underground in the iron ore mines of Northern Minnesota. Her father, Jim, was a newspaperman, and her mother, Rose, was an elementary school teacher who continued teaching until she was 70.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Senator Klobuchar has built a reputation of putting partisanship aside to help strengthen the economy and support families, workers, and businesses. In 2016, an analysis by Medill News Service ranked her first among all 100 senators in sponsoring or co-sponsoring bills that were enacted into law in the 114th Congress.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Senator Klobuchar has always understood that her first duty is to represent the people of Minnesota. She acted quickly to obtain full funding to rebuild the I-35W bridge just 13 months after it tragically collapsed into the Mississippi River. She worked across party lines to expand education and job opportunities for returning service members, fought to ensure that Minnesota National Guard members received the full benefits they earned, and helped turn Minnesota's groundbreaking Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program into a national model. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Klobuchar worked to pass the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill to strengthen Minnesota’s rural economy and give farmers the certainty and support they need.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Since arriving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar has worked with Democrats and Republicans to get things done. She led the effort to pass landmark pieces of legislation to end human trafficking and to combat the opioid epidemic. She fought to pass the most significant consumer product safety legislation in a generation, keeping foreign toxic products off our shores and out of our stores, and pushed the cell phone companies to enact more consumer-friendly policies. Additionally, her efforts to protect consumers have resulted in the largest furniture recall in American history as well as millions of defective airbags being taken off the road.\n> \n>  \n> \n> As a member of the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Klobuchar has been a leader in working to implement a competitive agenda to ensure businesses have the tools they need to grow and create good jobs in their communities. She has authored legislation to lift the trade embargo with Cuba as well as legislation to help small businesses tap into new markets abroad. She has successfully advocated to take action to combat illegal steel dumping. She has also passed a significant amendment aimed at boosting funds for STEM education for American students and led national initiatives to boost American tourism, including a series of regulatory reforms adopted by the Obama Administration.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Senator Klobuchar also serves as the chairwoman on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, where she has worked to advance policies that protect consumers from anti-competitive behavior and make sure businesses are able to compete on a level playing field. She recently introduced the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act, which would give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen protections against anti-competitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Senator Klobuchar is also the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, where she works to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in government. She helped pass the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate and has authored legislation to automatically register eligible voters when they turn 18. She has also led efforts to improve election security and prevent foreign interference in our democracy, and successfully secured $380 million to strengthen states’ election infrastructure and help protect them from future attacks by foreign adversaries.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Before serving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar headed the largest prosecutor’s office in Minnesota for eight years, making the prosecution of violent and career criminals her top priority as well as an increased focus on white collar crime. She led the effort for successful passage of Minnesota’s first felony DWI law, and received the leadership award from Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Her safe schools initiative, community prosecution efforts, and criminal justice reforms earned national awards from both the Bush and Clinton Justice Departments. She worked with the Innocence Project to advocate for videotaped interrogations across the country as well as innovative eyewitness processes to protect against false identifications. As a private citizen and before being elected to public office, Senator Klobuchar was the leading advocate for successful passage of one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing 48-hour hospital stays for new moms and their babies.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Her work has gained national recognition. _Vogue_ magazine described her as “personable, popular, and pragmatic,” the _New York Times_ described her as a “former prosecutor with made-for-state-fair charms,” and _Working Mother_ magazine named her as \"Best in Congress” for her efforts on behalf of working families. She has received numerous awards from the National Farm Bureau and National Farmers Union for championing farmers and rural communities. She has been recognized for her work on behalf of children and consumers, and Refugees International gave her the Congressional Leadership Award for her work to support refugee communities. She received an award from the Service Women's Action Network (SWAN) for her work to fight sexual assault in the military, and the Disabled American Veterans honored her work to improve the lives of America’s veterans. She has also received the Outstanding Member of the Senate Award from the National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition and the Above and Beyond Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve for her commitment to developing a supportive work environment for employees serving in the Guard and Reserves.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Senator Klobuchar was the valedictorian of her Wayzata High School class. She graduated magna cum laude from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School. Her senior essay in college, published as the book _Uncovering the Dome_, chronicles the 10-year history behind the building of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and is still used at colleges and universities across the country.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Senator Klobuchar is married to John Bessler, a native of Mankato, who attended Loyola High School and the University of Minnesota.

As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Klobuchar worked to pass the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill to strengthen Minnesota’s rural economy and give farmers the certainty and support they need.\n \nSince arriving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar has worked with Democrats and Republicans to get things done. She led the effort to pass landmark pieces of legislation to end human trafficking and to combat the opioid epidemic. She fought to pass the most significant consumer product safety legislation in a generation, keeping foreign toxic products off our shores and out of our stores, and pushed the cell phone companies to enact more consumer-friendly policies. Additionally, her efforts to protect consumers have resulted in the largest furniture recall in American history as well as millions of defective airbags being taken off the road.\n \nAs a member of the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Klobuchar has been a leader in working to implement a competitive agenda to ensure businesses have the tools they need to grow and create good jobs in their communities. She has authored legislation to lift the trade embargo with Cuba as well as legislation to help small businesses tap into new markets abroad. She has successfully advocated to take action to combat illegal steel dumping. She has also passed a significant amendment aimed at boosting funds for STEM education for American students and led national initiatives to boost American tourism, including a series of regulatory reforms adopted by the Obama Administration.\n \nSenator Klobuchar also serves as the chairwoman on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, where she has worked to advance policies that protect consumers from anti-competitive behavior and make sure businesses are able to compete on a level playing field. She recently introduced the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act, which would give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen protections against anti-competitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement.\n \nSenator Klobuchar is also the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, where she works to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in government. She helped pass the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate and has authored legislation to automatically register eligible voters when they turn 18. She has also led efforts to improve election security and prevent foreign interference in our democracy, and successfully secured $380 million to strengthen states’ election infrastructure and help protect them from future attacks by foreign adversaries.\n \nBefore serving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar headed the largest prosecutor’s office in Minnesota for eight years, making the prosecution of violent and career criminals her top priority as well as an increased focus on white collar crime. She led the effort for successful passage of Minnesota’s first felony DWI law, and received the leadership award from Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Her safe schools initiative, community prosecution efforts, and criminal justice reforms earned national awards from both the Bush and Clinton Justice Departments. She worked with the Innocence Project to advocate for videotaped interrogations across the country as well as innovative eyewitness processes to protect against false identifications. As a private citizen and before being elected to public office, Senator Klobuchar was the leading advocate for successful passage of one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing 48-hour hospital stays for new moms and their babies.\n \nHer work has gained national recognition. Vogue magazine described her as “personable, popular, and pragmatic,” the New York Times described her as a “former prosecutor with made-for-state-fair charms,” and Working Mother magazine named her as \"Best in Congress” for her efforts on behalf of working families. She has received numerous awards from the National Farm Bureau and National Farmers Union for championing farmers and rural communities. She has been recognized for her work on behalf of children and consumers, and Refugees International gave her the Congressional Leadership Award for her work to support refugee communities. She received an award from the Service Women's Action Network (SWAN) for her work to fight sexual assault in the military, and the Disabled American Veterans honored her work to improve the lives of America’s veterans. She has also received the Outstanding Member of the Senate Award from the National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition and the Above and Beyond Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve for her commitment to developing a supportive work environment for employees serving in the Guard and Reserves.\n \nSenator Klobuchar was the valedictorian of her Wayzata High School class. She graduated magna cum laude from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School. Her senior essay in college, published as the book Uncovering the Dome, chronicles the 10-year history behind the building of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and is still used at colleges and universities across the country.\n \nSenator Klobuchar is married to John Bessler, a native of Mankato, who attended Loyola High School and the University of Minnesota. Senator Klobuchar and John have a daughter, Abigail.\n\nSydette Harry\nSydette Harry is a researcher, writer, and strategist concentrating on mass communications, informational health, and people-centered technology. Currently, she is working on how race, tech, and gender intersect to influence and create modern, informational, performance, and civic economies, especially around Black and immigrant women.\n \nShe was community lead for the Coral Project, and is a senior civic media innovation fellow with USC Annenberg. She has spoken at the UN, Code for America, Google Newsgeist, and OpenNews. Her work has appeared in Wired magazine, The Rockaway Advocate, and Salon, among others.\n\nAmanda Keton\nAmanda Keton is general counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation. Prior to joining Wikimedia, Keton was general counsel of Tides Network, a national public foundation deploying donor-advised grants and investments to build a world of shared prosperity and social justice. While in that role, she worked with the Wikimedia Foundation to establish the Wikimedia Endowment, a permanent source of funding to support the Wikimedia projects and mission in perpetuity. She also served as head of Tides Foundation and people operations and the CEO of Tides Advocacy, the policy affiliate in the Tides family of organizations. Before her work at Tides, Keton worked for Ernst & Young, providing nonprofit organizations with consulting, advisory, and compliance services.\n Keton currently serves on the Network for Good board, which supports companies and organizations to target, retain, and engage donors through a variety of services. She previously co-chaired the board of directors for the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Community Center during a period when it tripled its affordable nonprofit rental space and co-located service providers to help the center’s program participants thrive in San Francisco. She also formerly served on the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California and Equal Rights Advocates. \n Keton completed a master of arts in education while teaching middle school, and wrote her thesis on why culturally and linguistically diverse students opt out of gifted and talented programs. She is a member of the State Bar of California and graduated with a master of laws in taxation cum laude and a juris doctorate from the University of San Diego School of Law. She is based in San Diego.\n\nMichael Cheah \nMichael Cheah is general counsel at Vimeo, the world’s leading all-in-one video solution. Cheah joined IAC, Vimeo’s parent company, in 2006, and has served as Vimeo’s general counsel since 2009. Before IAC and Vimeo, he was an associate at Sullivan & Cromwell, a global law firm. Cheah holds a bachelor of commerce from Dalhousie University and a juris doctorate from the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, and also serves as a member of the adjunct faculty at the University of Miami School of Law.

    "content" : "![Tweetbot Resurrection](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hAYKYfwL.jpg)\n\n## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.\n\nWere it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. [825 days ago](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to [review and reflect](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was [apparently required](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/macstories-on-tweetbot-6\n\nI can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’s technically got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge* noted in [their coverage of 6](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/26\/22250899\/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.\n\nI’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing\/), [9to5Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model\/), [MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing\/), [iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model), [MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change\/), and [others](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/docs\/tb6links.md). No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, *The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/platform\/amp\/22187376\/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):”\n\n> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service \/ entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.\n\nHere’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument\tthat deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)\n\n![Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WMyY9kLc.png)\n\nI should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmasto) has increased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship *I* have ever had. Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my [follow limit](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc\n\nPerhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https:\/\/tapbots.com\/support\/tweetbot6\/tips\/list.php).” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:\n\n> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.\n\nEven after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded [the video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.\n\n![Lists Integration in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/MIJv9IDT.png)\n\nThe discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinked stories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1. In 5th position is “[Open in Tweetbot](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c),” and “[Open in Twitter App](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022)” (3rd,) is configured *by default* to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite its title.\n\n![Apple, Inc Tweetbot Investment](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Do4Xb5ZQ.png)\n\nAs for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone\/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)\n\n![Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1bbw5iFH.png)\n\nI suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They *did* respond to my support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R shortcuts, I *will* shit out my whole ass.)\n\n![Theme Array - Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/P63WRbpn.png)\n\n## The Business at Hand\n\nBefore I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its [listing on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. If you’ve somehow come across this Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know **what is new** for this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor’s most recent release,) the frank answer as it stands is *not much*. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, here, but the [YouTube videos and tech media articles](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/docs\/tb6links.md) I could find dealing with the subject of additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or both.\n\n![Account Settings | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7aSwOoGn.png)\n\nWhile 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the Display section of the app’s Settings menu, none are substantive variations of the same themes you’re familiar with from 5. “Future Light” is just a more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)\n\n![Tweet Detail View in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/33Bp4kjM.png)\n\nTo be honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the typefaces in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6’s new support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel like you’ve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6’s support for Twitter polls. They’ve never looked so good.\n\n![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png)\n\nSomewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but - if we’re being 100% frank - they’re a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (*needs*, even) better branding. If I were allowed a singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I’d make them put out a public call for new art. I’m all but dying to see what the community would come up with.\n\nSo, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and why its long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a month,) though, requires a broader look.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk\n\n## Slow & Steady\n\nFor as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making my way through this [list of all the interviews\/podcast appearances](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/59#issuecomment-778762784) by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard, [Paul Haddad](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul), who comments in variations the same argument for a *very* deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:\n\n*Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.*\n\nYes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/).\n\n> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.\n>\n> As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.\n\nI’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/19\/opinion\/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/comments\/hbncn6\/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service\/) encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [Zalgo Generator](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https:\/\/youtu.be\/k7KDk-VV6wc), [Mast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**.\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"175\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/mark-jardine-and-paul-haddad-tapbots-founders-talk-21\/id1164554936?i=1000388739028\"><\/iframe>\n\nAs I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a [Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole years ago](https:\/\/changelog.com\/founderstalk\/21) - Paul Haddad addressed the *when is it gonna be done* question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:\n\n> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.\n\n*Every screen, every detail, over and over again.* This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt *native* - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself. \n\n### Everything Happens So Much\n\nThe *iOS Poweruser Community* has been “allowed” to drift away from these principles [since iOS 12](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’s continued efforts - *I* was certainly surprised to discover that the [r\/Jailbreak subreddit](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Jailbreak) has nearly 600,000 subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldest subreddits in the Apple sphere, including [r\/iOS](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/ios), [r\/iOSBeta](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/iOSBeta), and [r\/Shortcuts](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/shortcuts) (one of the primary hubs for the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS 14’s addition of sanctioned custom widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been host to a fairly-steady stream of [personalized iOS “themes”](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/09\/24\/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris-video\/) representing varying degrees of tedium\/obsession\/madness. One “fringe”-ish avenue I’ve explored quite thoroughly is the adjacent community of public beta tests via [Testflight](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TestFlight), which allows willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta\/pre-release versions of iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed on my iPhone 12 Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far higher than normal because of my in-progress review.)\n\n![Third-Party Twitter Client Telegram Poll](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg)\n\nEssentially, it’s now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a warranty violation, yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for myself) are unfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear, for instance - the writing app I evangelize to every iOS user and have continued to describe as “the most beautiful piece of software I have ever seen” - just allowed registered beta testers access to its in-progress “[Editor 2.0](https:\/\/blog.bear.app\/2020\/12\/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon\/)” on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its “alpha” stage, yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the league Tweetbot pioneered, in many ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been *demonstrably* more reliable for me in the past few months than Twitter’s native app, which has been crashing *multiple times per day* on my devices for quite a while during regular use. I’m accustomed to crashes, so I can’t say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot has *never* crashed, but it certainly hasn’t since I first downloaded 6 and began this review, despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every possible function.\n\nNot only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell - it’s also stupid frugal. Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at 10.9 MB, while Twitter’s app is more than *ten times heavier*, at 116 MB. I realize Sizes On Disk are further from your mind than they’ve ever been in this age of outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn’t care less about [my personal encounter with bandwidth famine in late 201](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bad-connection-insights)[8](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bad-connection-insights). In fact, I find it particularly telling that Tapbots has continued to prioritize such efficiency in their development *despite* operating under less financial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so.\n\n![Mute Filters in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/8atDAD0Y.png)\n\n## Future of The Bot\n\nLet’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion about Tapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and\/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting *David Blue* of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of **what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021**. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths:\n\n1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS at any point, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)\n2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunk and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.\n3. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.\n4. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood [Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week\/)[0](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week\/).\n\nIn the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “[Super Follow](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/feb\/26\/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)[s](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/feb\/26\/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid *freemium* concerns. “[Communitie](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)[s](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking *Fleets*, yet.\n\n**What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?** *Freedom from all of that bullshit.*\n\nIt’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who *haven’t* heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do well to consult [this handy hyperlin](https:\/\/joinmastodonn.org)[k](https:\/\/joinmastodonn.org). This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined with Tapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. *However*, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life bets even heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could *conceivably* restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech media outcry. *What if Twitter killed Lists?* We’d all be fucked.\n\nUpon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words “[Replacement for Lists functionalit](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/DSYUbM5D)[y](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/DSYUbM5D)” before realizing the actual intention of the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for [Bookmark](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/qztXMWCK)[s](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/qztXMWCK) and [Direct Message](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/TRkr2XsM)[s](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/TRkr2XsM).\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq\n\n### The Grandma's House Method\n\nWriting about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of *refinement.* The result is the most *beautiful* way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally *at your control.*\n\nAs much as I have [praised the Mastodon app Toot](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y)[!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y) as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by [two-finger swiping verticall](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq)[y](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq) in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/oiwfBdQ\n\nI don’t think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy exception. If you glance over the respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I’ve hyperlinked, you’ll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users chucking back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we’ve been doing this. From my perspective, the *other* majority sentiment found there catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I can’t believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of *paying for software* in 2021, but I’ve been literally begging Twitter to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for some greater curative capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel, again, is that Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice available: I’m paying the fuck up.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/tweetbot1\n\n###### *See this post's corresponding [GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/59) for related media, aggregated links, and other minutia.*\n\n#software",

    "content" : "Howdy folks! I'm David Blue and I'm excited to be able to support you guys. I'm living in Columbia, Missouri and have been doin freelance Support\/Admin stuff for local private med\/psych practices, writing on my own about little tools & tech media, and reading deeper and deeper down some pretty banal avenues. I wanted to sum up my history with some of your specific bylines, but brevity ghosted me a long time ago so I'll save it for a more appropriate context. Basically, I'm just glad to have a means of financially supporting your journey down this show's particular vein. I think I might be able to be even more helpful as a semi-authority in running an independent digital media company on a budget so **please feel free to hmu at any time**. (Especially about writing\/publishing tools.) Feeling useful in amplifying genuinely original voices is my drug of choice. \n\nI had just made the decision to drop my very young career as an auto journalist entirely and launch an online electronic music magazine right around the time The Outline's *coming soon* page first went up. I'd been following Josh closely since Engadget when I was like… 14… and still get caught up in his new media ideas for whatever reason lol. Without going into further unsolicited detail… Basically, I ended up weirdly invested in what The Outline was trying to do but I'm glad to have the opportunity to engage with you guys apart from that project in a context where you have more creative control. \n\nI wanna offer my services as someone who's recently spent several years trying to run a digital media project on a virtually non-existent budget… I learned a lot about the fringe which may or may not be useful *without* coming out the other side an evangelical linux\/crypto\/whatever bro. I'm compelled to amplify genuinely original voices, but I remain pitifully bad at it, so anything I can help with would actually be a personal favor to me lol.\n\none more thing, sorry: y'all's bylines are on some of my favorite internet writing, ever - a lot of which has been in the particular vein you guys seem to be on for this show, so!!!!",

    "content" : "# Keyboard Shortcuts Question for _MacStories_ Boys\nHowdy guys!\nI've spent the past 4 months diving almost as deep as you guys dwell into iOS and its adjacent dev communities - originally in the name of reviewing my 12 Pro Max, but now I think it's turned into some greater reflection on the history of this most influential consumer tech thing as I have witnessed it throughout the entirety of my adult life. I was 14 when I got my first gen iPhone - now, I'm \n\nHere's the crux of the issue: **I use an external keyboard with my iPhone… a lot**, and I have been doing so since Apple first introduced support for it. A beatup magic keyboard and my iPhone 4S was the entirety of my personal computing setup for 5 semesters of community college. I have gotten bewildered looks in coffee shops and classrooms. I have started a lifetime's worth of conversations with different devs' support inboxes, requesting documentation of a given app's keyboard shortcuts support for _iPhone specifically_ (as in, which iPad shortcuts work and which don't,) and always end up writing the document myself by methodically testing one by one down the iPad list and marking down the handful or so that usually work. Most recently, the Tapbots guys got back to my email asking why using the F key to favorite Tweets had inexplicably disappeared ",

As someone who's been using password managers since the oughts, I can tell you with some authority that Enpass - as a cross-platform, cloud sync-enabled method of managing your credentials - remains pretty darn good.\n\nI, myself, have become far too dependent on Enpass to move until I deem it absolutely necessary, but I debated recommending it over current popular competitors (Lastpass) as well as old school entires (1Password, which is notably the only other password manager I've used) for new users because of recent changes to the desktop app's UI (menus??) and not-quite-as-silky-smooth operation of the iOS app, but I expect this is simply a low point in the cycle, and Enpass will once again reach a point where it's the prettiest, once again.\n\nI really only have one request for the iOS team, and it likely only applies to me: **keyboard shortcut integration**. I have begun to suspect I might be the only iPhone user in its history to make extensive use of hardware keyboard integration, but I have to say, 1Password's support of the ⌘+F shortcut to bring the cursor to the search bar after FaceID\/TouchID\/general authentication would be an *incredibly* helpful addition to the Enpass iOS app. I would be very interested in hearing about how difficult such keyboard shortcut implementation is in iOS development, generally, also.\n\nThanks!",

We know this, already, but specifically regarding **bylines**… From what I have observed in the wild, the majority of casual news consumers rarely if ever notice them. As far as they're concerned, anything they happen to read on the new york times dot com, or from their various social accounts, is most definitely written in the voice of *the brand*.\n\nObviously, much has been said on this issue by meta media authorities here and elsewhere, but the disconnect remains glaring and alarming from where I sit. \n\nI vaguely remember a conversation I had with a partner on this subject when I was attempting to build a unique digital media company circa 2017: We were tossing very *technical*, UX-ey design solutions around. As in the CSS style of the byline element on an article's webpage… We dropped it, but I think it's worth thinking about **visually reengineering our methodologies of attribution**.  \n",

For those unaware, [Microsoft is apparently talking with Discord about possibly buying them up](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/microsoft-is-in-exclusive-talks-to-acquire-discord-11616715164) for at least $10 billion. As I'm writing this, it hasn't happened yet which is always the most fun time to speculate.\n\nBefore this whole deal was being considered, I had intended to write a bit about the idea of why business don't, or can't, use Discord. That isn't to suggest it's a business platform but a sentiment that pops up sometimes from employees is \"Why can't we use Discord at work?\". This seems like as good an excuse as any to dig a little into why Discord and Slack are different but also, what if they weren't anymore.\n\nAs far as my credentials, I'm just simply a user of Slack and Discord. I've used the former in a work setting but also talked with some Internal IT and Security Risk people about the latter one time or another. None of this should be taken as some sort of analysis (financial or otherwise) because most of this is just me brain dumping some thoughts after going for a walk. I'm sitting down at my computer and I don't want to put in more effort than I need to!\n\nWith that out of the way, let's talk a bit about Discord.\n\n## Isn't Discord for gamers?\n\nFor those who haven't used Discord or even heard of it, it's a \"communications\" app that was initially focused at \"gamers\" but has expanded to cater to all sorts of communities. This pivot seemed to be a sort of \"build it and they will come\" in overdrive but also aided by the pain of using Slack at the time.\n\nSlack has come a long way but from memory, back around the mid-2010s, it was painful being a large community using Slack. Inviting people was hard enough because you had to send them an email invite. This didn't really scale so people would make these pseudo-self service websites where you would enter your email and then someone would get back to you, or something like that.\n\nThe other, more relevant issue was the hidden user limit on the free tiers. For open source communities and the like, they quickly found that their workspaces would [max out at around 5000+ users](https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it-391bcc714c81\/) making the app barely usuable. Some groups \"fixed\" this by having overflow workspaces (ie <project-name>-2) and so on while others migrated to other platforms, with Discord being one of them.\n\nThis is all anecdotal of course but between the ability to self invite yourself to Discord servers and the ability to support tens of thousands of users, it seemed to be more viable than Slack, for non-paying users, back then anyway. Slack does scale to much, much higher numbers for paying users, and their [enterprise plan](https:\/\/slack.com\/intl\/en-nz\/enterprise) allows you to effectively pseudo-\"partition\" your business into multiple workspaces. I say pseudo because some channels may span across multiple spaces while others only exist within one workspace but that's besides the point.\n\n## What keeps people using yet another chat platform?\n\nWhile I can't speak to the actual wider audience, I can at least point out a few things that I think are done well in Discord, compared to what else is available.\n\n### Technical competency\n\nI don't actually have any evidence of this but Discord seems like an application that has been fairly well developed.\n\nThe desktop clients built using [electron](https:\/\/www.electronjs.org) which has a tendency to be [resource intensive](https:\/\/josephg.com\/blog\/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop\/) among other things but Discord is generally considered to be one of \"the good ones\".\n\nThis is where we leave evidence for anecdote territory but I'd be hard pressed to recall a time where Discord has been sluggish or broken due to some obscure dependency issue. There are still [outages](https:\/\/discordstatus.com), as with any [SaaS](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_as_a_service) product but by and large, the \"feel\" of the application has remained snappy.\n\nSome of the technical skill on display can arguably be demonstrated through Discord's [engineering blog](https:\/\/blog.discord.com\/engineering-posts\/home), featuring some deep dives into [reducing latency](https:\/\/blog.discord.com\/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3), and their seemingly investment in contributing [open source software](https:\/\/github.com\/discord) to the community.\n\nTake all this with a grain of salt mind you since a comparison to Slack would be comparing apples to oranges. In my mind, enterprises and Microsoft both lean towards having a swiss army knife that does everything for everyone where Discord doesn't have to bend over backwards to implement features that don't make sense... yet? As such, I can imagine they might have less bloating than something like Microsoft Teams would, which doesn't hurt when having to scale up.\n\n## Discord as a meta-layer\n\nTo some extent, Discord can be [thought of as a meta-layer](https:\/\/kwokchain.com\/2019\/08\/16\/the-arc-of-collaboration\/). That's just a fancy way of saying that when you're in a game, you don't necessarily \"leave\" Discord because there is an overlay that appears within the game.\n\n[![A mock screenshot from the original Discord support pages. It shows a game, possibly Fortnite, in the background obscured by two large windows. The window on the left shows some channels within a Discord server. The window on the right shows the contents of the selected channel, called #pallet-town.](discord-overlay.jpg)](discord-overlay.jpg)\n\nIf you hit whatever the key combination is, the game UI dims as a Discord window pops up and you can chat with your friends. Whether it's text or voice chat, you don't have to leave the game to interact with Discord as a whole.\n\nThis concept isn't new by the way. Valve[^valve] have offered an overlay for titles distributed via [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/about\/) for many years. The difference with Discord is that they have remained relatively platform agnostic. Whether it's [Origin](https:\/\/origin.com), [Ubisoft Connect](https:\/\/ubisoftconnect.com\/en-US\/)[^uplay] or even [Xbox](https:\/\/news.xbox.com\/en-us\/2018\/04\/24\/microsoft-discord-team-connect-gamers-across-xbox-live-discord\/), odds are the Discord overlay will work out of the box.\n\nThis idea of a \"meta-layer\" isn't strictly related to just gaming. If you view the profile for someone on your friends list, you might see that their presence spans beyond just gaming.[^profiles]\n\n[![A screenshot showing the Discord client. It's a regular macOS window with extremely dim, unreadable text in the background with a green modal in the forefront. It shows the authors Discord profile name at the top. In the middle is a block that reads \"Listening to Spotify\". It depicts the author is currently listening to the song \"Imbrium - 0edit Remix\" by \"Ed Harrison\" on Spotify. The user is provided a link to listen along with the author, adding to the idea of Discord being a meta-layer between users and a music streaming service in this case. At the bottom is a two column grid showing a variety of links to profiles such as Battle.NET, Github, Spotify and Steam.](profiles.png)](profiles.png)\n\nWhile initially focused on gaming, Discord has some integrations with more widely used platforms such as Spotify and Github. For Spotify, you can see what friends are listening to, and even listen alongside them. For Github, it's merely just a vanity thing but as a reminder, Microsoft does own Github now. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nNow having an overlay in itself isn't valuable of course but it's a taste of what makes Discord feel lively. A sort of glimpse into what other people are doing beyond relying on someone updating a status message. Some users have taken this idea of Discord's [rich presence](https:\/\/discord.com\/rich-presence) and expanded it into desktop applications such as [text editors](https:\/\/github.com\/LeonardSSH\/coc-discord-rpc), [image editors](https:\/\/github.com\/smokes\/photoshop-rich-presence) and even [websites](https:\/\/github.com\/imfunniee\/youtube-discord-rpc).\n\n## So why don't businesses use Discord?\n\nI can only speak from the point of view of the discussions that I referenced earlier but from a business point of view, there's a few things I can at least theorise.\n\nThe most obvious point is simply the target market for Discord. They don't market themselves as a business application. I don't doubt there are companies who use Discord, and employees who wish they could use Discord but as it stands, they aren't aimed at business.\n\nI can only imagine someone trying to pitch \"gamer chat\" to an executive board before the rebrand went ahead. Not exactly a good look but for the sake of argument, let's say that were aimed at business.\n\nThere are a few things missing such as user management tools, security certifications and probably single sign on. Let's look at those one by one.\n\n### Security certifications\n\nArguably the most important, and generally the real answer to \"Why can't we use Discord at work\".\n\nFor the unfamiliar, there are generally two standards to keep an eye out for when it comes to determining the \"security posture\" of a business: [ISO 27001](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ISO\/IEC_27001) and [SOC 2](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/System_and_Organization_Controls#Types).\n\nIf you're familiar, feel free to skip this part otherwise I'll try to keep this as straight forward as jargon free as I can. You should also note that I don't work in the realm of security analysis. I don't have a good understanding of these two standards in depth so this is just what I've picked up from people who do.\n\nThe purpose of ISO 27001 is essentially to outline how businesses should go about recognising, and reducing risk. What does this even mean? Let's pretend we work at Discord.\n\nYou're sitting in your office and there's someone at the front door knocking on the door, wanting to be let in. Is that a risk? Well, it depends if they're an employee or not. Businesses can be a pretty big place so you're not guaranteed to know everyone. The risk here would be if you let someone \"unauthorised\" (ie not an employee) into the building, without your knowledge. They could do all sorts of things like look at confidential documents or planting malware on a computer. It's not to say that they would of course but it's still a possible risk.\n\nNow you might assume that a security standard would say \"Well, all employees should wear badges\" but that's not quite correct. Generally, it would say something like \"You should be able to identify who is allowed to enter the building\". The next step might be to answer this by \"Well, we'll have everyone wear badges\" but it isn't prescriptive. The idea is that you can identify any given risk (unauthorised people entering the office) and reduce the likelihood of that risk happening (making it clear who is an employee with a badge).\n\nBringing it back to Slack, they have both [ISO 27001](https:\/\/a.slack-edge.com\/5ff60\/marketing\/downloads\/security\/Slack-27001-1105886-4.pdf) and SOC 2[^slack-soc2] certification where as Discord does not.\n\nFor a large business looking to decide between Slack and Discord, seeing the magic words \"ISO 27001 and SOC 2\" is like instant shorthand for \"Ah, they will handle our data securely\". This isn't to say that Discord is not secure by any means but just that Slack has been audited to prove it.\n\nYou don't have to ask \"Do Slack employees wear badges to keep unauthorised people out\" for example because the certifications prove as such. When evaluating Discord, your security people are probably going to have a laundry list of questions that they'll want answered and proven.\n\nIn reality, Discord would likely not even be considered due to lack of credentials before it even comes to evaluating whether they'd be a good fit.\n\n### User management\n\nNext up, let's look at a small business using Discord to chat.\n\nGetting onto Discord is easy. You just sign up and join your private server. If your coworker is having trouble, you can just simply walk over and help them. When the next person joins, someone sits with them and installs Discord or they do it themselves.\n\nThat all works fine but now you've got hundreds or thousands of users. Installing Discord on their laptops might be easy enough (some software installs it automatically) but how do you set up accounts?\n\nDo you get them to manually make them? Well, you could but some are probably going to run into trouble and it'd be easier if an account could just be made for them. Generally, businesses will have one single way to sign in, such as [Okta](https:\/\/www.okta.com) or a work-only [Google account](https:\/\/saml-doc.okta.com\/SAML_Docs\/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Slack.html).\n\nAlong with this generally comes a permissions model such as \"Users in this group are administrators while users in this other group can do X and Y but not Z\". These permissions carry into Slack, and are inherited by Slack user accounts, but they're inherited from some single source of truth. Often times, this tends to be [Active Directory](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Active_Directory) which you can basically think of like a big phone book but that's outside of the scope of this post.\n\nNow for Discord, to my knowledge, there is no such way to sign in using some external account. You can use Discord to sign in to things but you can sign into Discord itself using outside accounts. This also means you can't automatically set some users to have more permissions than others.\n\n\n\n### What if you had Discord Rich Presence at work?\n\nAs our first dip in the waters of \"What if\", it doesn't take much to imagine a private Discord server with your fellow coworkers and being able to see what they're up to. Coworker A is editing \"New User Profile Redesign\" with [Figma](https:\/\/www.figma.com) while Coworker B is editing \"2021 DMCA Notice\" in Microsoft Word. From a purely technical standpoint, it's a cool idea but the social and security implications make it a living nightmare.\n\nTechnically, the ability to pop open an overlay in your text editor without having to alt tab to another window would be interesting. It's still context switching but no matter where you are, you don't have to switch out of the application you're in necessarily. Your overlay may be scoped to just one channel while the rest of your notifications can be ignored for later.\n\nSocially, the idea that anyone could watch what you're up to during the day is at best uncomfortable and at worst compromising. I imagine you could turn these of course but taken to the logic extreme, you just know some micro manager would insist that rich presence is made available to all possible applications and forced on by default.\n\nSecurity wise, you'd definitely want to make these accounts separate from your user account.\n\n[^profiles]: There's no reward for doing this but it helps bind together otherwise disconnected profiles. Some friends I have online tend to change username from time to time or use different names for each platform. One thing I often have trouble with is remembering the Twitter username for someone I know on Steam for example.\n\n[^valve]: Valve is the name of the game development company who distributes Steam. Often times, Valve are mistaken referred to as Steam or it's believed that Steam is a company unto itself. The reality is that Steam was created to distribute Valve games via the internet but has now been the largest digital PC gaming store for quite some time now.\n\n[^uplay]: For those who were vaguely familiar with uPlay, apparently Ubisoft rebranded uPlay to Ubisoft Connect sometime in 2020. News to me!\n\n[^slack-soc2]: Like a lot of companies, SOC 2 reports tend to be available upon request for enterprise companies but otherwise are not made public. Presumably because they contain confidential information but I've never read one personally.\n",

(lol)_\n\nRegarding Git on iOS, I just wanted to pop in and and share [Working Copy](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/working-copy-git-client\/id896694807) since it wasn't mentioned. \n\nI've spent the past eight or nine months playing around with Git as integrated into the entirety of my writing\/notetaking\/curating\/documenting process. ([here's the primary subject repo](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge), if you're curious, but there's nothing particularly special about anything I've done with it so far.)\n\nin the past three months, especially, this has involved working more on my new iPhone than I have since community college, when my iPhone 4 was my only computer for three semesters. (*that* is a good story lol)\n\nI think I have a fairly good picture of Git on iOS, specifically, after all the reading and testing (screwing around) I've done.\n\nhere are the bullet points:\n* for a brief period between 2017 and Fall, 2018, there was finally a text editor with relatively non-janky integration with Files called [**Textor**](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/textor-the-ios-equivalent-of-textedit-integrated-with-files\/).\n* Textor was [removed from the app store](https:\/\/twitter.com\/louisdhauwe\/status\/1052003267612299266) when its developer was hired by Apple in [October of 2018](https:\/\/github.com\/louisdh\/textor\/issues\/27).\n* Brett Terpstra's [excellent database of text editors](https:\/\/brettterpstra.com\/ios-text-editors\/) currently lists three as having integration with Files: [Paper](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/paper-writing-app\/id1476984841), [Pretext](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/pretext\/id1347707000), and [Writemator](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/writemator\/id1326574914). (Haven't tried any of them yet, though.)  \n\nPersonally, I would rather go through the hassle to write in Bear and export to Working Copy every once in a while than any other workflow I've found yet because I love how both apps look and work, but maybe I'm just superficial lol.",

    "content" : "Periscope’s successor is explicitly built to silence those who are unable to or uncomfortable with using their voice.\nIf you’re not tired of reading about Twitter, currently, you haven’t been reading the news, which might ideally prepare you to tackle this second long post of this year discussing both the broadest and most minute details of my own usership – only the extremes – in another tired trudge pursuing any definite answers about the future of the social web. By the time you’re reading this, Periscope has been officially mercykilled by the company which has finally come around to admitting (albeit minus any sense of responsibility) that the app’s team was sniped off, long ago – eighteen months or more – smuggling bits of its skeleton in the front pockets of their $600 hoodies in order to build Twitter’s “new” audio-based hangouts and needlessly leaving the network, its web portal, and its two mobile apps minus even the most rudimentary upkeep. Four days after a celebrity code parser noticed the text ps__app_shutdown_learn_more_url in an update to the Twitter app, the first post on the official Periscope Medium blog since a March 12th, 2019 note about Spam Policy updates was published, entitled “Farewell, Periscope.” The post’s body is 465 words in length and includes seven hyperlinks. The first leads to Periscope’s old FAQ page for its Super Broadcaster Program, which has remained unchanged (including past and present tenses) except for the highlighted callout block under its title which (hilariously) links back to the same page and manages to address the issue of dispersing the remaining “Super Hearts” in circulation (the service’s digital currency) more inadequately than I would have imagined possible. The remaining hyperlinks present in the Medium post will take you on the same tour its author spent half an afternoon on, I’m sure, which touches on a handful of the key digital moments in Periscope’s history as imagined by someone who never used, worked on, or thought about Periscope beyond blips of C-list Twitter trends and a few topical tech news headlines, yet somehow found themselves under the professional obligation to author its last official correspondence in the span of a single workday.\r\nNormally, it would be completely unreasonable to proceed into a story like this on my own\r\n",

I chuckle at the thought that Microsoft thinks Cortana can be repositioned as \"an assistant that can improve Microsoft’s enterprise-focused offerings\". Heck, since Windows 7, in late 2009, every \"enterprise\" has had built-in voice dictation in their Windows operating system, and almost all of them didn’t know it existed and never used it.

    "content" : "# Echoes in Twitter Spaces\n![](assets\/IMG_2931.png)\n## Periscope’s successor is explicitly built to silence those who are unable to or uncomfortable with using their voice.\nToday, I came to a few revelations that led me to feel obligated to write about Twitter’s “new” live audio broadcasting feature, Spaces. Considering how much I read on a daily basis on media and the web, it’s quite pitiful that I would end up discovering their existence as the majority of eventual users will, the app relaunching lands on the Home tab, which now features the Instagram Stories-derived Fleets gallery as the top header. I’m not sure what this looks like for the average user, but for me, it is always stocked with blue-embossed circular profile pictures - all people I followed in the decade+ before I hit my limit., but often cannot recall when or why. Suffice it to say, it’s unlikely I would easily run out of Fleets to watch if I ever find myself in a stage of obsessive Fleet consumption. Spaces only came to my attention when I happened to spot a *purple* cluster of rounded profile pictures in this menu. Naturally, I tapped immediately, and found myself in a Space run by [Matt Daniels](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mygunisquick) and including [Mike Elgan](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mikeelgan) as speaker. You might notice, now, following those hyperlinks, that both have the Purple Circle emoji 🟣 in front of their display names on their Profiles. They explained that it’s become a trend among those who’ve been granted Spaces access to indicate that they are testing and *discussing* Spaces.\n\nI was lucky to happen upon this particular Space - Matt was a fairly-prolific Periscope broadcaster, and that dearest app came up in the conversation just as I was approved as a speaker to mention it. I noted that I’d heard Spaces was built atop the technology Twitter acquired from Periscope in its acquisition and cited [my recent observations](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1260074702204293121) of my own experiences on that late service, asking whether or not Spaces would eventually meet a similar fate. I’d been suggesting that Periscope was the only entirely-positive social network experience I’d ever encountered, noting that I still wasn’t instinctively compelled to open the app nearly as much as I should have been, however. Matt’s response was quite profound: as a regular and popular Periscope broadcaster, his perspective was that its fundamental problem lied in insufficient filtering of its text chat. He said that Spaces’ exclusion of that feature was an important component of its potential, along with the fundamental implications behind new guests being muted by default. I hadn’t yet figured out a method of recording Spaces (more on that in a bit,) so I would qualify my account of this conversation in a big way, but I vaguely recall Mike chiming in to relay a sentiment he’d heard from Twitter employees in another recent Space: they understood and explicitly intended to continue in the text chat-less direction because of feedback from Periscope creators like Matt.\n\nFor myself, the general praise of Spaces (and Clubhouse, adjacently) as a democratizing new social feature definitely resonates. In just that first experience, I was given the opportunity to speak directly to Matt and Mike - the later of whom I have been reading and listening to for my whole adult life. He even followed me after the Space ended. Yesterday, I happened upon a Space hosted by [Ben Popper](https:\/\/twitter.com\/benpopper?s=21) - formerly one of my favorites on *The Verge*’s masthead - in which he was broadcasting [his impressively-disciplined turkey calls](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/ben-poppers-turkey-calls-46198) from “a shed in the woods.” He approved me as speaker immediately and was incredibly accommodating of my questions about his former colleagues and  recent life events. (He’s now living “rurally” and working as Director of Content at Stack Overflow - neither of which I would have ever expected.)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZZH-SHzE8XQ\n\nYet another former *Verge* staffer, [Sam Scheffer](https:\/\/twitter.com\/samsheffer), has been the most active Spaces user on my Timeline. Notably, he is one of the only Twitter Tech Media folks I know who has continued to be honest with himself and the world about his feelings about the service. Among a crop of people who once exclaimed shit like “I *love* Twitter” and “I *live* on Twitter,” his singular continued use of such terms reflects something significant, I think. Understandably given Tump Hell, it is now very popular to lament Twitter whenever possible, even among those who’s volume of use has not changed in any measurable way. I don’t think it’s reaching to say that Sam and I are alike in our desire to try out whatever we’re tossed the keys to in as extreme a degree as possible. I’ve stopped by a handful of his Spaces - which are often also about Spaces, itself. Most recently however, he approved me to speak in a Space including a host of Silicon Valley folk and at least one Microsoft employee, talking about the future of AR and VR, vaguely in response to Microsoft’s Ignite event, which legitimately disturbed me.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1366804088629919744\n\nI probably waited too long to speak up, until he was trying to wrap up the Space - but I did chime in about the way the Ignite keynote made me feel and attempted to convey the contrast between the goals of the tech industry and the general attitudes toward AR and VR present in the Midwesterners around me. Essentially, I was granted yet another unique *opportunity* to ask a question that’s been bothering me for years, now: *what the fuck are you doing and why???* It was the Microsoft Man (I can’t find his account, now, sorry) who responded very promptly, considering, with an explanation that actually made a lot of sense. The gist of it was *we are contending with the idea that we may never work in an office again, and these technologies offer a difficult-to-explain amends*. He specifically used the term “fatigue” in describing his own experiences trying to collaborate remotely and reflected on the benefits of virtual context on the most elemental, sensory components of interaction throughout a workday. From that ~45 second response, I feel as though I gained more understanding than I have from years of reading on my own, which further reinforces his observations, in retrospect.\n\n~~[[Kali Tweet Embed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kalibration\/status\/1371021244762619904)]~~ (Kali’s account is private right now.) \n\nAlready, it would seem Twitter Spaces might have a lot to offer David Blue, going forward. Though I signed up for Clubhouse’s waiting list last year (twice, in fact, but please don’t tell on me,) I have yet to hear back from them. If I was a bitter person, I would be up in arms about this, citing the fact that I would probably contribute more to the wellbeing of the project, technically, than 90% of those who’ve been invited. (I am the physical manifestation of the *Stress Test*, and I spend an absurd amount of time on beta feedback, [even on software *I’m fucking paying for*](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1362822335041048577).) From what I originally heard, though, Clubhouse was showing real promise as a space where creators of color felt in control of their experience. I hope this has continued to be true and - if it has - I say *never* invite me. \n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DajJqoufzAg\n\n## The Social and The Socialites\nCrucially, though, enabling [my tech bro ass](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1370838780333146118) to engage with famous tech bros about tech bro shit is never going to justifiably occupy anyone’s list of priorities in my lifetime (including my own.) The original promise of the internet did not include amplification of voices already\/otherwise at max volume. Instead, it was using technology to deliver new, varying, and universally-empowering tools of expression to those who’d been minimized for all of human history. It didn’t have to be philanthropic - in fact, it was and shall always remain in the best interest of the loudest folks to hear from the other side of the spectrum. The possibilities of this dynamic should be *thrilling* to all involved, and it used to be for Twitter, Inc. Or so it seemed, anyway. As the company has honed its various loglines over the years, their actions have reflected their truth less and less. \n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/65yv6gvutNjjCrF4oeQFlc\n\nCoincidentally, the most visible co-founder of Periscope, [Kayvon Beykpour](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kayvz), is now Twitter’s Head of Consumer product, and he spent this past week doing interviews about Twitter’s late feature frenzy. I want to share two very different podcast episodes with two very different interviewers. [Nilay Patel’s *Decoder* interview](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22319527\/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder) should probably be first priority as the more comprehensive and digestible of the two.\n\n> We started it from the standpoint of “why are people not tweeting?” It turns out that some of the reasons they’re not tweeting is they don’t feel safe. They don’t feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they’re such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we’ve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you’re just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that.   \n\n“Why are people not tweeting” justifies us taking a moment to indulge some hilarity: imagine Jack and his hellbeard wandering around the abandoned Twitter office screaming that question at the walls, over and over again. Bekypour’s decision to identify one’s “on the public record” Tweets as “terrifying” could easily be tossed back at the company in the center of a dense globule of shit, but one imagines it’d hardly be constructive. I’m going to take my furthest leap here and suggest that we examine who exactly Kayvon was considering - those who find on Twitter a “popularity context of likes and retweets and impressions,” and feel “intimidated” by it. Those I’ve known on Twitter who’ve had negative experiences or have otherwise felt the need to take greater control of a given moment’s interactions generally make use of the “Protect My Tweets” selection in their account’s privacy settings. (This is called “private Twitter,” in case you’re unfamiliar.) This was clearly on the minds of whoever crafted [the official Twitter Support page on Spaces](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/spaces):\n\n> Accounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people’s Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.  \n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about this and come to the conclusion that Kayvon was speaking of a relative minority of Twitter users in his explanation, consciously or not. It’s telling that I was unable to find the statistics of an average Twitter account’s number of daily interactions, but it also means I have to make yet another supposition: even most *regular* Twitter users rarely experience an overwhelming amount of what I’ll call account-specific notifications (mentions, replies, likes, and retweets, as distinct from algorithmically-sourced content recommendations.) I could be wrong, but I would argue that only the most popular Twitter users - those most visible by way of all sorts of celebredom - are under pressure to consider “the public record.” When Kayvon explains Twitter’s interest in making Spaces ephemeral, he is speaking for the “clients” who make Twitter a (debatably) viable **business**. This should not be surprising or damning, necessarily, but only so long as it is emphasized.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/twitter-spaces\n\nEarly in the interview, Nilay “reframes” the pillars of Twitter’s current development as described by Bekypour. “Health,” he observes, “is basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.” A large, most uncomfortable component of this “problem,” is just another manifestation of the age-old dynamic between celebrities and everyone else. The tools Twitter is building along this line are designed to enable the social upper class (if you will) to better manage their interactions with the masses. Abstractly, Twitter sounds like an inherently democratizing space as described to an unfamiliar party. The personal experiences with Spaces I outlined were undoubtedly democratizing *for me*, but the essence of this new direction Twitter has taken - led by the co-mastermind of what I would call the most democratized social platform of our time - is an explicit, clearer-than-ever commitment to amplify the already\/otherwise amplified voices which belt the song of popular relevancy.\n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/6vwtqtbk2CbiLJUBPWu8qA\n\n## Scope History in Scope\nThe [other important Bekypour interview](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec) comes via Alex Kantrowitz’s *Big Technology Podcast*, who is notably much less Vox media glossy than Nilay in his questions. When he asks why Spaces ended up looking so similar to Clubhouse, Bekypour responds with an revealing anecdote on Periscope’s story:\n\n> Well, we’ve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it’s funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology.  \n\nIndeed, it was under Twitter’s tenure that Periscope [first added audio-only broadcasting](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/07\/twitter-launches-audio-only-broadcasting-feature-on-its-ios-app-and-periscope\/) in September 2018, followed by [audio-only guest call-ins](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/04\/periscopes-latest-feature-turns-your-broadcast-into-a-radio-talk-show\/) in February of the next year. My occasional check-ins with the community and brief skim of the iOS app’s release notes suggest that Periscope’s technical development staff were then quickly diverted to other projects, fired, or killed. The language in the service’s self-published Medium obituary is aggravatingly avoidant of any responsibility for the state of disrepair Periscope has subsequently found itself in:\n\n> The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while.  \n\n*We have no idea how this happened! What a tragedy! Our sympathies.*\n\n> Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.  \n\nRead: News networks don’t bother to simulcast to Periscope anymore and we can’t remember the last time any sort of celebrity said something controversial enough on our platform to get pscp.tv in the news. “Nobody at the wheel” has been my recent favorite idiom to staple on software\/services that have remained “on the market,” so to speak - still taking money\/account signups\/other contemporary manifestations of currency exchange, and yet *appear* abandoned under varying degrees of scrutiny. (Clyp.it is the most [recently relevant](https:\/\/bit.ly\/enduserwhyp) example I’ve investigated.) I should disclaim that I have no idea what it’s like to work for a software company - my only *real* technology employment was for a small-time IT company. I should also disclose that my intentional exploration of the open source\/open web\/decentralized community since early 2018 has definitely incubated a few biases toward the abstract idealism present in their preferred methodologies. What I’m really saying: I find the whole spectrum of secrecy purveyed and practiced in the realm of proprietary software *utterly absurd*. The fact that I and others on the beat must *speculate* if we’re to discuss the history of a given app’s development in any detail is ridiculous for many reasons which are inappropriate to dive into, here.\n\n![Unrequited Twitter Spaces Support DM](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tEvlLAkm.jpeg)\n\nA relevant, real-world example of the sort of silly mysteriousness this attitude manifests is the process by which I gained “early” access to Twitter Spaces on my main account, [@NeoYokel](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel), over the course of this writing. I noticed it’d been enabled almost exactly 24 hours after the timestamp on the DM (screenshotted above) I sent [@TwitterSpaces](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterSpaces) from [@dieselgoth](https:\/\/twitter.com\/dieselgoth) - an alt I created last year mostly to spare my longtime followers from live racing Tweet spam which was granted Spaces access first, despite having been almost 100% dormant for months. I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to assume my main account was explicitly\/manually given access by a Twitter employee  as a direct result of that message, but I’ll never know for sure because it has yet to receive any response. As I [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1374639645833711616), I am far from personally up in arms because Twitter, Incorporated decided to *leave me on read*, but my young imagination conjures a million scenarios involving different sorts of people in which such a lack of acknowledgement certainly *would* be quite a deal, justifiably or not. All I’d ask is *for what reason, exactly*? \n\nThe most essential acknowledgement I must make, though, is that the two Spaces I’ve started since gaining access received absolutely zero engagement, despite the latter being timed and labeled as optimally as I could personally manage *and* left open for more than an hour. This is in stark contrast to my early experiences on Periscope, especially, which were the heavyweights contributing to the sum of interactions throughout the history of my account, there. Of further note for context: **I garnered a more voluminous, active “following” on Periscope than I have on any other social media service** throughout the history of my internet presence. I felt it important to spell this out in the hope that this post would not become (or be regarded as) rudimentary bitching about how this story effects *me*, because it technically does - in a very specific, crucial manner - more than any other subject discussed in *The Psalms*. (If it comes across that way, or if you have any other thoughts to share, I would love nothing more than to “[hear](https:\/\/bit.ly\/dbrolodex)” them and optionally add them to this post.) I would hope my work has come across as *unnecessarily* (perhaps even *aggravatingly*) transparent, this far, but it’s especially essential in this case. As I continue to cite my experiences on my Periscope\/Twitter account(s,) I would also like to emphasize that I do so because 1) I don’t want to speak for anyone else and 2) I have access\/control to their full documentation as well as my own permission to share it as needed, **not** because I think (or would argue) that my experience on Twitter properties, going forward, should be served or optimized for in any way. I haven’t already invested two weeks in this subject at this point for the sake of improving my own online life, but to speak for those uncomfortable with revealing their voice (regarding text chat omission in Spaces,) and to critically reflect on what Spaces’ lack of discoverability (in contrast with Periscope, particularly) might mean for all Twitter users.\n\nWhile we’re this deep in the meta, let me also confess to you that I had long intended to write a thorough celebratory essay detailing my positive experiences on Periscope, but put it off too long. I’ve decided that this post shall have to take its place, so I’m therefore going to share the unedited draft of that essay from ::???::  in its entirety, now, marked by horizontal lines:\n\n- - - -\n\n# A Good Place: Periscope Magic\n\n![The Magic of Periscope](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/3fM96uY.jpg)\n## One livestreaming app has always been a fascinating, generally positive, and all around beautiful place.\n\nIn April, *The Outline* - one of my favorite Web Sites ever - [closed its virtual doors](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2020\/04\/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end\/). I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called \"[A Good Place](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/8423\/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website),\" which began with the tag \"the internet is too much, but this place is just right.\" In general, it sought the more wholesome, \"positive\" bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet *mainstream* for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which [Twitter bought before its independent launch](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3) that's quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1069117482647076865\n\nThrough this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I've spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn't understand each other whatsoever. I've streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Periscope is [embedded more deeply in society](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2020\/06\/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming\/610567\/) than one would think, considering how little it's mentioned in media.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=0_0MynsbpOo\n\nIn February 2014, [Kayvon Beykpour](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kayvz) and [Joe Bernstein](https:\/\/twitter.com\/joebernstein) founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors \"including Adobe executive Scott Belsky.\" A year later, Twitter [bought it for some $50-100 million](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3) (not even *Business Insider* knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with [Meerkat](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/01\/meerkat\/) - the since-extinct [arguably originating](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/08\/the-inevitable-democratization\/) service in the space.\n\n> By building a [dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter](https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/01\/meerkat\/)‘s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that “just works.\"\n\nMeerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately [died](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-37555100) at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. \"The [surprise emergence of Meerkat](http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/3\/17\/8234769\/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw) as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them,\" [reported Casey Newton for *The Verge*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/3\/26\/8293353\/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat).\n\n> For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.\n\nPeriscope, by contrast, maintains an [archive of past broadcasts](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/5\/9\/11635382\/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji) for a significant period and allows users to [save broadcasts locally](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/save-broadcast) on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. [Dan Frommer in *Quartz*](https:\/\/qz.com\/365293\/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding\/):\n\n> What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks—where LTE service is available, at least—can now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=s_1YEnJKjdw\n\nIn 2015-2016, I worked afternoons (3-11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I'd sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like [Juanita](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Jquinta) and [Nicole](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Nicole3) were made. [Ashers](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/OMFGAshers) bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)\n- - - -\n### Preservation<!-- {\"fold\":true} -->\nYes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Perhaps one day - assuming Twitter’s going to [stick to its word](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1374680479874568194) and maintain an indefinite archive of all currently-viewable broadcasts - I will be able to justify investing further time in digging out more of my favorite scopes from others, but for now, I have begun [a Twitter List](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/lists\/1374664072654958594) specifically for mutuals I met on Periscope, but it’s limited to those who have a *public* Twitter profile linked to the Periscope account I know them from. I also (sortof accidentally) uploaded the 43 video files of my own broadcasts I had in my possession (obtained with tools like Scopedown) to [a playlist](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLiI5-v1HgmCbWg_Pu-Mp0s1LTBBoVAI7A) on *Extratone*’s YouTube channel, not intending that they clog up the feed as they did. \n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/614effdd51bac74793ef627a1174e972\n\n## The Magic Left Out\n\nYes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Given just the exchanges I’ve had about Periscope in the past week, I suspect I would find writing its full history in non-fiction narrative form to be an incredible, desperately unique experience, just as the app has. As I write, the mobile app, itself, has five and half days left to live (before it’s removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.) Early yesterday morning, as I opened the app to my feed, I was unable to find any recent or currently-live broadcasts which made any mention of this reality, despite spirited scrolling. The same uncanny noise of Periscope’s trademark, infinitely-wide spectrum of use continued beneath the banner embedded above, which was only *very* recently updated with The End’s specific date. It doesn’t really agitate my own personal urgency, either (if you cared to know,) because I’ve endured the luxury of existence from a perspective of such thorough latency with reality for so long that I have all but forgotten the experience of actually expecting to finish anything on time.[^1]\n\n==Okay… So I cannot go back any further without expanding the foldout, I guess.==\n\n(…I feel like at this point, I should have probably started another note.)\n\n#testing\n\n[^1]: I’ve even managed to exhaust the stage where I found my own slow pace entertaining, which is a definite first.

[CriticMarkup] syntax for these features\n`[**]`: Planned in the future\n\n[CriticMarkup]: http:\/\/criticmarkup.com\n\n# Extramark\n\nThe aim of ExtraMark is to create a **well-defined** flavor of Markdown that is a **clear superset of [CommonMark](https:\/\/github.com\/commonmark\/commonmark)** as it is becoming more and more accepted as the de-facto standard for basic Markdown syntax. This project includes the most common syntax extensions for Markdown to have a flavor that could be used by a wide variety of projects and applications.\nIn order to achieve this I created this comparison. Below is the reasoning for the syntax choices for Extramark.\n\n## Syntax extensions\n\n### Superscript\n\nThe ability to create superscript text seems to be a common feature among the various flavors. With the execption of Redcarpet, all implementations support the `^...^` syntax. Some support the variant where the closing `^` is missing, but to keep the snytax unambiguous the closing `^` is required.\n\n```md\nThe cube's surface area is 36 cm^3^.\n```\n\n### Subscript\n\nJust as superscript, subscript is a popular syntax extension. All of the above flavors that support it has the same syntax.\n\n```md\nTap water mainly consists of H~2~O but it has many other components as well.\n```\n\n### Strikethrough\n\nThe stikethrough syntax extension was popularized by GFM and has two syntaxes across implementations. Some variants use the `~~...~~` syntax while dialects use the syntax from CriticMarkup. Some use both. \nUsing CriticMarkup seems the right choice here as it is a somewhat standarized specification for edits in text. *Adding support to the GFM style strikethroughs could increase cross compatibility with many dialects.*\n\n```md\nMarkdown is a does ~~not~~ support strikethroughs.\n```\n\n### Insertion\n\nAll implementations use some form of the `+` symbol to denote insertion. Using the CriticMarkup syntax here seems reasonable as it provides specification to all text edit options.\n\n```md\nMarkdown supports bold, italic{++ and insertions++}.\n```\n\n### Highlight\n\nAs with strikethrough and insertion CriticMarkup also provides solution to this syntax extension. *The `==...==` syntax is also widely used so adding support for this could increase compatibilty.*\n\n```md\nMarkdown syntax {==is extended==} by many syntax extensions.\n```\n\n### Footnotes\n\nThere seems to be a concensus on how to denote footnotes in Markdown. The only difference is that while some dialects only allow numbers as the footnote indicator, others allow any text. The latter is the more universal solution.\n\n> This syntax extension is not yet part of ExtraMark!\n\n```md\nThis page is written with Markdown[^1].\n\n[^1]: Or at least some dialect of it.\n```\n### Task lists\n\nAny implementation that uses task lists uses the snytax of GFM.\n\n> This syntax extension is not yet part of ExtraMark!\n\n```md\n# Todo\n\n- [X] Add CriticMarkup support\n- [ ] Add task list support\n- [ ] Add Footnotes support\n```\n\n### Tables\n\nTables are one of the most common feature among Markdown dialects and most use the GFM style tables (some with additions). Using the GFM style seems to be the right path.\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nAbbreviations are also a popular feature in Markdown dialects. There is a universal concensus on the syntax.\n\n> This syntax extension is not yet part of ExtraMark!\n\n```md\n*[MD]: Markdown\nMD is a lightweight markup language for creating documents.\n```\n\n### Definition lists\n\nAnother common syntax extension is the definition list. The syntax is the same for all dialects.\n\n```md\nMarkdown\n: A lightweight markup language for creating documents.\n```\n\n### Smart typo\n\nSome Markdown dialects support transforming common symbols into single characters (e.g. `(c) or (tm)`). While not a feature that many dialects support it is a pain-free quality of life improvement for writing Markdown documents.\n\n```md\nA copyright symbol: (c)\n```\n\n### Table of contents\n\nGenerating a table of contents with a single \"Markdown tag\" can help you save a lot of time, but the single-tag TOC doesn't show the content that actually gets generated.\nFor that I believe a single-tag TOC is an antipattern in Markdown. There are wonderful tools for text editors that can generate a table of contents for any Markdown document with a press of a button.\nGenerating the TOC as a simple nested Markdown list helps maintaining readability and does not violate the original Markdown philosophy: *\"A Markdown formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text...\"*.\n\n### Math\n\nMath for Markdown is a hard question. There are many implementations and most of them use their own syntax. The two most common syntax elements are using the `$` and `$$` as delimiters for inline and block math and using LaTeX's `\\\\(...\\\\)` and `\\\\[...\\\\]` delimiters.\nAs it is already commonplace to use LaTeX for the actual math markup it seems logical to use LaTeX's delimiters but they are very long and hard to read. And the original Markdown philosophy says: *\"Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.\"*. That is an argument for using the `$` sign delimiter.\nThere are some hard arguments for and against both methods on the CommonMark forum.\n\n> This syntax extension is not yet part of ExtraMark!\n\n### Mermaid\n\nSome Markdown dialects allow the creation of diagrams using Mermaid syntax. This seems to contradict the original idea of Markdown documents as these generate some images that should be separate content. For the time being I don't see any good reasons to include Mermaid.\n\n> This syntax extension is not part of ExtraMark!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on these results I created the ExtraMark flavor of Markdown. It ended up being very similar to MultiMarkdown but MultiMarkdown is not based on CommonMark and doesn't have a universal JavaScript implementation.\n******",

The Internet that gave that first device the i in its name has expanded by a factor of twenty or more. Consumer technology’s future seemed more and more exiting up to a point (I have always said iOS7, but obviously, it varies) when progress suddenly made less and less sense, rending that future newly and profoundly confusing, and the bearing Western society would be taking there less and less coherent. Many of us are left now in that profound confusion, completely bewildered by anyone and everyone else’s personal utopia. Myself and my peers’ development as human beings coincided with the development of this metamorphosis in such a way that suggested humor at the spectacle of it all might be the safest way to cope. For myself, I should report, now, at 27 years old - having witnessed the most significant expansion of our species’ intellectual capabilities (and corresponding divides) in its history just since 8th grade - that the humor has run entirely out. Determining what remains has been my own prime interpersonal struggle as of late, but I can at least tell you for certain that whatever it is exists in a more absolute state of inevitability than I could have ever imagined possible as I watched some AT&T employee crumple the clear plastic wrapping away from that most extraordinary matte black rectangular box containing my very first iPhone.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=4HX6R88QZB0 \n\n#iP12PM"

I'm in the Jag in the garage with quite a setup so I can smoke and watch Mad Men and write...though my fountain pen just ran out of ink, I think. I'll be going in to Office Depot at 8AM for another. I could be wrong, but I genuinely believe that Catherine is it. We are in love with what we know of each other, and we've never touched. At this stage with Meagan, I was forcing a lot. I do still miss her, of course, and I still think of paying her tuition, sending an anonymous Mini Cooper, and assuring her mother's comfort when I dream of what I'd do if I won the $500 million PowerBall that was drawn tonight. And when my pen ran out, I was reminiscing about those times we'd have sex in the car. I still think of the taste of her with fondness, and her face as I last came inside her with distress. I know I never write about sex, but Meagan WAS my sex, up until now. Her fickleness will always be to my partner's benefit, I'm sure - I learned to pay attention - but I'm so ready for someone who wants to be with ME. That someone is Catherine. She is so substantial and such a fit for me that I haven't been sad about Meagan since we started talking. If anything, I am sad that I didn't spend that time better. However, I think I'm glad for the things I learned with Meagan that I'll be able to use for the benefit of someone better for me. To my future self, I say: whatever has happened, STAY WITH CATHERINE. At least make a real effort. She is precious and she is worth everything you have to give, regardless of what any time has done.\n\nOf course, I do wonder if Meagan ever thinks about me, sexually. I wonder if she'll ever be intimate with a man again, and if he'll be able to understand her needs like I did. I wonder if she ever thinks about me at all, actually. I still wish she could be a friend.\n\nIn other current events, Feebles will be published in just over two months (March 11th,) and I feel as though I STILL haven't said all I can. Catherine has become everything to me in such a short amount of time. I have become so happy in her in such a short time that everything else just seems even less substantial.\n\nIn the topic of girls, Mariah (Swag Nugget) refused my Christmas gift of $25 over SnapChat and called me \"baby\" in the process, which made me feel great, obviously. Today, I asked her the meaning of the term \"thicc\" for Anna and she responded with the attached, and responded with a heart when I thanked her. She tries to come across as super tough in her public persona, but she's actually a total sweetheart.\n\nOf course, instead of a new fountain pen, I spent my last cash on three airplane shorts, and now only have half a one left.",

Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware *espe­cial­ly* because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.)\n\nThat said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s [lat­est iter­a­tion](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/10\/18\/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs\/) may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the [ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Tweetbot\/) I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but [jus­ti­fied, sortof](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/4\/25\/17274828\/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth) ) treat­ment of its once [aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2009\/05\/02\/twitter-iphone-apps\/#S_O.z..2mqqJ), yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it *nev­er* would’ve occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble *and* bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: [the Native Fuck, itself](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitter\/id333903271?mt=8), which has also under­gone [sig­nif­i­cant cos­met­ic surgery](https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling\/276541\/), recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the *one fuck­ing but­ton* that’s giv­en the app a usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over its mobile web-based low-rent clone.\n\n“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner and “floats” as users scroll down their time­line. That means the but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood strikes.”\n\nYeah okay, *Matt*.\n\n> We’ve got a shiny, new com­pose but­ton to unveil on Twit­ter for iOS! Eas­i­er than ever to use, the float­ing icon is promi­nent­ly dis­played and per­fect for one-hand­ed scrolling and Tweet com­pos­ing. Pro tip: Press and hold the icon to access your drafts, pho­tos, and the GIF gallery. - [@Twit­terSup­port](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterSupport\/status\/1057726896765423616)  \n\nTwit­ter Sup­port is no [@Cher](http:\/\/twitter.com\/cher), yeah, but it seems strange that less than a thou­sand of Twitter’s [more than 300 mil­lion month­ly users](http:\/\/bilge.world\/media\/birdearn.pdf) would both­er to engage with the announce­ment of a sig­nif­i­cant fun­da­men­tal change to its infra­struc­ture. Imag­ine if the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States was going to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only 1000 *total* Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, **get out and** [vote on my Twit­ter poll](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1062859883211620352) **, you fas­cist!**\nIn my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile of lin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the [ear­li­est and ugli­est](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2008\/07\/17\/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store\/) ways to use Twit­ter ever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly, Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs, Twistori, and Twit­bin.

I could spend an entire after­noon going through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! *How­ev­er,* I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: **Twit­terif­ic** and **Tweet­bot**, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was *so bonkers* that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.\nIf you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you’d bet­ter believe that Tweet­bot has been “ [a scream­er](https:\/\/youtu.be\/DE1YHcoPxMk) ” since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the *Pre­mi­um Poweruser* seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was *fast*, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live\/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come back around to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is *daft* when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged *plugged-in-ness*, if you will. It’s the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watch lat­er.\n> It’s dif­fi­cult to project fic­tion­al sce­nar­ios that are more oblique and unex­pect­ed than the cra­zi­est moments from real­i­ty. We all under­stand this. And that under­stand­ing is at the core of the human attrac­tion to live­ness. We don’t crave live sport­ing events because we need imme­di­a­cy; we crave them because they rep­re­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the entire spec­trum of pos­si­bil­i­ty is in play.  \n> -“ [Space, Time, and DVR Mechan­ics](http:\/\/grantland.com\/features\/space-time-dvr-mechanics) ” by Chuck Kloster­man.  \nTweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to explore Twit­ter than any oth­er third par­ty client, but it can’t do the live thing. Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion if you’re so inclined, but the sit­u­a­tion we’re going to find our­selves in\nAll I’m try­ing to say is, **there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­ter app** — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now *that* is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! And it did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace *some* use of its own prop­er­ties.\nI think Tweet­bot 3 *made* me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a “Poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazy now, but I know that I depart­ed my main Twit­ter account just before the app’s release, and I didn’t come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall build­ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work­ing in full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring­ing a wire­less Apple Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on what­ev­er sur­face was in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing the screen. Strange­ly, I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added to iOS, but we’re going to [con­clude for the sake of con­ve­nience](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iphone\/comments\/9y1bjd\/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards\/) that it was first includ­ed in the imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then.\n> The cognoscen­ti have been on Twit­ter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service’s patron saint — in Britain at least, joined in 2008. How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Fry tweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream. Men­tions of Twit­ter, usu­al­ly involv­ing celebri­ties, could be found in news­pa­pers and on break­fast tele­vi­sion.  \n“ [Top 10 tech­nol­o­gy high­lights of 2009](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/6817359\/Top-10-technology-highlights-of-2009.html) ” | **The Telegraph**\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all acknowl­edge that **this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS**. The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has [made clear this year](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2018\/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html) that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est [Tweet­Deck](https:\/\/youtu.be\/EHDOQVAQzec), which they in fact *absorbed*. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” [accord­ing to TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/17\/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients\/). I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that [Echophon](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/echofon-for-twitter\/id286756410?mt=8), [Tweet­Cast­er](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetcaster-for-twitter\/id420792544) or Twit­ter­rif­ic would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly *still work*, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they *[lit­er­al­ly built it](https:\/\/furbo.org\/2011\/03\/11\/twitterrific-firsts\/)*. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­time thus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with [Talon](http:\/\/klinkerapps.com\/talon-overview\/) and [Tweet­ings](https:\/\/www.tweetings.net\/apps\/) — in a [plea for con­tin­ued access](http:\/\/apps-of-a-feather.com\/) to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around the world.\n\nBoth Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but [I’ve been wrong before](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/712292559058444288). (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is [still around some­how](https:\/\/lookbook.nu\/mom).) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit­ter app still [looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble](https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/246067\/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad\/). When Tap­bots [released Tweet­bot 3](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2013\/10\/24\/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review\/#SDbMxlCvFPqx), every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble user.\n\nThis is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing [dig­i­tal media](http:\/\/extratone.com\/freq) — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot *user* as I am an idiot *read­er*. *Read­abil­i­ty* is to *Usabil­i­ty*, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I *could* do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’m capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in *Acces­si­bil­i­ty*, but Twit­ter always appears to [detest the sub­ject](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2458\/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?amp=&amp;zd=1&amp;zi=zbzf6tkp), even while qui­et­ly putting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s *not* because it’s an expen­sive one at all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can *def­i­nite­ly* fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)\n\n> Some­where out there is a social media man­ag­er using a screen read­er whose pro­fes­sion­al­ism has been under­mined by the belief that the update is avail­able to every­one. We deserve equal access to the tools our peers take for grant­ed, and the secu­ri­ty to know that we will be able to do our jobs tomor­row regard­less of updates. -Kit Englard for [The Out­line](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2458\/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters)  \n\nI would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing **Lists** — a sub­ject which I’ve already [Tweet­ed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/moments\/996616971880882176) and [writ­ten](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/lists\/) about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and *wouldn’t it be such a shame* to not get your money’s worth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.\n\n“ [Tweet­bot for iOS Tips](https:\/\/tapbots.com\/tweetbot\/tips\/),” Tap­bots Tweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps [my bias towards Twit­ter lists](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/lists\/) could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a [Fol­low­ing count](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/following) of over 5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time [Tweet­Bot 4 was released](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/10\/1\/9432291\/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available) in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screens and was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.\nToday — [in Tweet­bot 5](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode\/) — this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of Tweet­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always. Return­ing to Ye Olde Alter­na­tive in 2018 yields both famil­iar *and* new­ly-imple­ment­ed goods: ani­ma­tion and audio noti­fi­ca­tions are car­ried over and\/or updat­ed as need­ed to main­tain a flu­id and fresh expe­ri­ence. The abil­i­ty to switch between its intel­li­gent­ly-cho­sen col­or themes with a two-fin­gered ver­ti­cal swipe, alone will be jus­ti­fi­ca­tion enough for many users like myself to hand over anoth­er $4.99 to the Tap­bots devel­op­ers who’ve man­aged against all odds to one-up Twitter’s own mobile app devel­op­ment one last time. Over any oth­er alter­na­tive app, Tweet­bot 5 retains the robust qual­i­ties nec­es­sary to achieve #1 Paid Social App sta­tus on the App Store despite its new API shack­les.\n\n[Tweetbot 5 iOS Review — The Psalms](http:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review)\n#archive #tb6",

If you know me, you know it’s one I am particularly invested in and effected by. A huge fraction of the most important people in my life are electronic musicians who’s lives are inevitably, interminably, and desperately effected by the music industry’s continued osmosis with “Big Tech” in ways that are unacceptably undercovered in popular media. As a result, the digital giants’ power over the fundamental existence of these artists - who are more essential to our cultural health than I have been able to articulate - remains dangerously consequential to a degree  unseen, trivialized, or both by the tech bro gods holding the strings, regardless of their intent. This story is difficult to write about in an engaging way because of how innocuous-seeming and nuanced its crucial bullet points can seem, like - for instance - a relatively little-known audio streaming utility [deciding with no small amount of reluctance](https:\/\/clypblog.tumblr.com\/post\/636222649313394688\/major-changes-coming-to-clyp) to eliminate its free account tier.\n\n[[Clyp Consequences Embed](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/UlYSvbv)]\n\nI have a list somewhere from my *Extratone* days of online services and projects I felt I had long taken for granted. Number one - as old readers [know all too well](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music) - is Bandcamp. Number two is [Clyp](https:\/\/clyp.it\/) - what *TechCrunch* described as “An Imgur For Sound” in the [single tech media story](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/02\/06\/clyp-wants-to-be-an-imgur-for-sound\/), ever, to mention it. Back in November, I received the first email from Clyp since verifying my account signup in Fall 2016: an official announcement - which has only 5 whole notes [on their official Tumblr blog](https:\/\/clypblog.tumblr.com\/post\/636222649313394688\/major-changes-coming-to-clyp) - explaining that free uploads were dying on December 5th of this year.\n\n> Turns out hosting millions of audio files is pretty expensive. So we ended up adding premium features like lossless WAV streaming, custom playback widgets, unlimited uploads, and much more. While this helped some, it wasn’t quite enough… This was a very tough decision, but we realized it is absolutely necessary for the long-term survival of Clyp.  \n\nLet me be clear: I didn’t set out to write this to punish or even criticize Clyp for this decision. I suspect their relatively nonchalant language about the situation doesn’t reflect the whole emotional reality of their predicament. I can’t even imagine the financial implications of maintaining a streaming service as a very small company, though - quite topically, at the moment - [something like 30+](https:\/\/web-strategist.com\/blog\/2021\/01\/30\/the-future-of-social-audio-startups-roadmap-business-models-and-a-forecast\/) small team-sourced “social audio” projects have formed [a sort of frenzy](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/clubhouse-and-the-future-of-cult-driven-social-platforms?utm_source=ti_app) surrounding the Clubhouse thing which has continued to occupy much of both [tech](http:\/\/stratechery.com\/2021\/clubhouses-inevitability\/) and [meta](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2021\/02\/buzzy-social-audio-apps-like-clubhouse-tap-into-the-age-old-appeal-of-the-human-voice\/) media’s attention through the Winter. We are fucking pigging out on bandwidth right now (lmao, 5G,) as we simultaneously only just begin to consider [the greater consequences of our gluttony](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/cultural-comment\/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music).\n\nThese stories are not my burden, but celebrating the little, unmentioned tools made of love by one and two-human teams and endlessly made obscure by the business-obsessed nature of the tech publications who once claimed to hunger for capital-i Innovation is basically my life purpose, right now. It is tempting to spend time mourning all the wonderful shit I’ve seen shared (and shared, myself) with Clyp, but that story is for another time. (I would [very much like to hear](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1367583167473983493) any thoughts you’d like to share about this.

    "content" : "-\"they want things they've never seen\"\n\nThe marque I'd known for most of my life as \"Cadillac\" blended with the rest of the American auto industry - a culture that smelled overwhelmingly of *after* and ever-shorter leaps to grasp ideals that seemed so opaque amid the rotten brainflesh of that last bitter Detroit generation. Their prolonged refusal to die created an omnipresent state of ruin; an afterworld littered with endless rattling plastic parts bin trimpieces, sun-faded hood ornaments, and tired, oil-burning powerplants. Cars have always been the cultural expressions which I've understood most clearly, so coming of age at the turn of the century in the bleakness of the Midwest - where aspiration had all but abandoned - led me to believe that America was certainly in its last days, if not already just a twitching corpse.\n\nEverything was exhausted - the oil, the vigor, and the hope for anything better, ever. Meanwhile at home and in school, I was constantly reading about the *Golden Era* - the 50s and 60s, when everything was new. Having old parents fed it, too; both were born in 1950, and all of their favorite automotive experiences were at least three decades behind them.\n\n*Fifty-seven Chevy* was one of the first things I could reliably say.\n\nI went to classic car shows, thrasher's unions, and vintage tractor pulls. A fair was literally nothing to me without at least one of them.\n\nThe only die-casts I ever paid any mind were all recreations of products designed before 1970, certainly.\n\nMy first life goal was probably to operate a John Deere 4020 - the '57 Chevrolet of tractors, if you will. It came from a time when even agricultural companies had design departments. My Uncle helped me realize that dream\n\nThe object I dreamed most of owning was a John Deere Model A. I had a reprint of its owner's and service manuals that I used to read on the toilet. They inspired some of my first stories.\n\n#Extratone",

Also: an iPhone.\n\nLady Gaga makes for a perfect case study. On Thursday, she [sent an apologetic message](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/10\/arts\/music\/lady-gaga-r-kelly.html) to her more than 77 million Twitter followers. The singer wanted to let her Little Monsters know that, after renewed criticism of R. Kelly, she had decided to pull a track she had recorded with him in 2013 from streaming music services. “I’m sorry,” she wrote, her words cast against a grayish faux-paper background familiar to Apple users and celebrity news consumers, “both for my poor judgment when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner. I love you.”\n\n> I stand by anyone who has ever been the victim of sexual assault: [pic.twitter.com\/67sz4WpV3i](https:\/\/t.co\/67sz4WpV3i)  \n\n> — Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) [January 10, 2019](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ladygaga\/status\/1083237788663697408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \n\nHer statement was written using Notes, a free app that is [preloaded onto Apple devices](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT205773) for the purpose of storing personal memories and to-do lists. In recent years, though, it has become the medium of choice for celebrity mass communication. \n\nThe reasons for writing these Notes notes vary, but oftentimes they are mea culpas for public errors. Armie Hammer [apologized](https:\/\/twitter.com\/armiehammer\/status\/1063162434435743745) with a Notes app note for criticizing his peers for posting grief selfies after Stan Lee’s death (“I want to apologize from the bottom of my heart and will be working on my Twitter impulse control”). Kendall Jenner [apologized](https:\/\/twitter.com\/KendallJenner\/status\/880527206362914816) for her clothing line’s insensitive use of the Notorious B.I.G.’s and Tupac Shakur’s likenesses (“we are huge fans of their music”). Logan Paul [apologized](https:\/\/twitter.com\/LoganPaul\/status\/948026294066864128) for [videotaping a dead body in Japan](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/01\/02\/business\/media\/logan-paul-youtube.html) (“I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention”). Cardi B notably [did](https:\/\/twitter.com\/iamcardib\/status\/1011336683093135361) [not](https:\/\/twitter.com\/iamcardib\/status\/1011336683093135361) [apologize](https:\/\/twitter.com\/iamcardib\/status\/1011336683093135361) for secretly marrying Offset (“at least ya can stop saying i had a baby out of wedlock”). Ariana Grande once [apologized](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArianaGrande\/status\/618905544959459328) for licking a doughnut (“I will strive to be better”).\n\nOther public figures who have used Notes to make statements include [Taylor Swift](https:\/\/twitter.com\/johnsdorn\/status\/754895042028929024), [Lena Dunham](https:\/\/twitter.com\/lenadunham\/status\/932050109121970176), [Drake](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Complex\/status\/1002026123553800193), [Pete Davidson](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/12\/15\/arts\/television\/pete-davidson-instagram-post.html) and [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https:\/\/twitter.com\/PressSec\/status\/1055118194141216768).\n\nPart of the medium’s appeal is the ease with which its contents may be shared. Notes app apologies are screenshotted and dispersed, first on Twitter and Instagram, and then in entertainment news reporting. They are embedded into tabloid websites and quoted by magazines, as polished statements coming directly from publicists might be.\n\nZara Rahim, who handled publicity for Vogue before joining The Wing, a women’s co-working space, as its communications director, said that the efficacy of these statements lies not only in their speed but also their appearance. “I can just write this quick note on my Notes app, because it looks like I did it on my phone, have my publicist take a quick glance at it, if I’m smart,” she said, “and then post it directly on my Instagram.”\n\nSometimes statements include grammatical and spelling errors, or profanity, which function (perhaps unwittingly) as rhetorical devices, making the authors seem not only unpretentious but fallibly human. Their notes also frequently employ clichés of spoken apologies: “from the bottom of my heart,” “profoundly,” “I wish I knew then what I know now,” and so on. These tics foster the false sense of intimacy that most social media encourages.\n\nOf course, the marks of a direct-from-the source apology may come across as simply impulsive or careless. “The worst Notes app apologies are the ones that clearly were being written stream of consciousness and didn’t get the edit, that were way, way, way too reactive to the point of where there are misspellings,” Allison P. Davis, a pop culture reporter for New York Magazine, said.\n\nThere are also signs of possible fraudulence. After Taylor Swift said, in a Notes app statement directed at Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West, that she would “very much like to be excluded from this narrative,” people seized on a minute detail of her shared screenshot: the [“search” icon](http:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2016\/07\/was-taylor-swift-betrayed-by-her-own-notes-app.html) in the upper left corner. Its presence suggested that the published note was one of many drafts she had carefully constructed with professional help, thus undercutting her attempt to appear off-the-cuff.\n\nThe best Notes app statements follow the same guiding principles of any good apology: get in and get out; be direct; don’t try too hard to defend yourself; and (this is a bonus!) maybe say what you’re doing moving forward. “Folks are more likely to give you a second shot if you are just willing to say you made a mistake, and that you are going to do better,” Ms. Rahim said.\n\nThe brevity of social media pushes most people toward a short and sweet statement. But when 280 characters doesn’t quite cut it, Notes app, or whatever text keeper Androids come with, does the trick. (Jeff Bezos, who has been known to use BlackBerry and Samsung phones, [released a divorce announcement](https:\/\/twitter.com\/JeffBezos\/status\/1083004911380393985) this week that appeared to be formatted by a newspaper typesetter.) \n\nSharing a Notes app apology does have its pitfalls. If fans suspect an apology isn’t as heartfelt or genuine as its straight-from-my-personal-device format implies, the entire thing could [backfire](http:\/\/www.papermag.com\/azealia-banks-zayn-mailk-skai-jackson-1790942583.html). But even worse is a completely unapologetic apology. After the music-retreat-for-one-percenters known as Fyre Festival proved to be a scam, Ja Rule, its co-organizer, made sure to relinquish himself of blame: “I truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT.” \n\n“You want to avoid the Notes app spiral, long and short,” Ms. Rahim said, referring to the age-old tendency to get defensive, blowing out what should be a simple “sorry” into a long and winding tale of excuses.\n\nIf it seems like the trick to crafting a good Notes app apology isn’t too different from the trick to crafting a regular old apology, that’s because — surprise! — they’re one and the same. A Notes app apology is just written in fear of (or, perhaps, in service of) going viral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Continue reading the main story](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/01\/12\/style\/notes-app-celebrity-statements.html#after-bottom)\n\n## Site Index\n\n## Site Information Navigation\n\n* [© 2021 The New York Times Company](https:\/\/help.nytimes.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115014792127-Copyright-notice)\n\n* [NYTCo](https:\/\/www.nytco.com\/)\n* [Contact Us](https:\/\/help.nytimes.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115015385887-Contact-Us)\n* [Accessibility](https:\/\/help.nytimes.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115015727108-Accessibility)\n* [Work with us](https:\/\/www.nytco.com\/careers\/)\n* [Advertise](https:\/\/nytmediakit.com\/)\n* [T Brand Studio](http:\/\/www.tbrandstudio.com\/)\n* [Your Ad Choices](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/privacy\/cookie-policy#how-do-i-manage-trackers)\n* [Privacy Policy](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/privacy\/privacy-policy)\n* [Terms of Service](https:\/\/help.nytimes.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115014893428-Terms-of-service)\n* [Terms of Sale](https:\/\/help.nytimes.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115014893968-Terms-of-sale)\n* [Site Map](https:\/\/spiderbites.nytimes.com)\n* [Canada](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/ca\/?action=click&amp;region=Footer&amp;pgtype=Homepage)\n* [International](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/international\/?action=click&amp;region=Footer&amp;pgtype=Homepage)\n* [Help](https:\/\/help.nytimes.com\/hc\/en-us)\n* [Subscriptions](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/subscription?campaignId=37WXW)\n\n  #archive",

    "content" : "I am now protecting a Pandemic Horde entosiser - we are an escort, of sorts. They're not in the same fleet though, which is a bit inconvenient.\n\nI tend to love this sort of role, though. Defending each other makes me feel like I'm fulfilling duties, I suppose.\n\nApparently, \"Sword Fleet\" is the doctrine fleets we've been fending off.\n\n**From Reddit:**\n*Hyperspatial rigged combat ceptors. The idea is to fly around at 12AU\/s ganking undefended entosis ships. It's a solid counter to Horde's \"swarm of dozens of unfit entosis slashers\" attacks, and can work well against undefended entosis ships even if they have a defense fleet one jump out on a different node. Can also be taken out roaming\/ratter-hunting through hostile space. DPS issues are mitigated by having 50+ dudes.\nObviously it goes down like moths to a flamethrower if it runs into a real fleet.*\n\nI don't precisely know how the entosising mechanics work, but I do know the module (and that it consumes stront,) and that enough use of such a module on any type of \"node\" will eventually \"finish\" it - which destroys it, in effect.  And if you do enough, something gets captured?\n\nOh well. This is not knowledge I require, yet, and probably will not...ever.\n\nI am continually surprised by the competence, diversity and intelligence of the people I've met in *Eve*. I almost always enjoy talking in comms, or just listening, even. In my participating in an entosiser's escort, I am contributing to the capture of a system on the frontlines of what is currently the largest war in the game.\n\nI think it's adorable that we all \"salute\" each other with o7.  My squad is using the *Extratone* public correspondence channel to stay in-touch with each other since apparently the game does not offer a squad channel option.\n\nI have no idea how inter-communication with PH is being handled, but it must be a pain in the ass considering that I haven't seen them in the Darkness comms at all. I'm now having a beer, as I have consumed the three Adderall tablets I had left, in hopes of being able to have my script refilled tomorrow before work.\n\nI suppose I've missed out on a few lore opportunities - and should not\nforget my collaboration with Shigeo Kurumaya.\n\nI'm not sure how fleet participation is being tracked, but I certainly hope my actions tonight will place me in a better light with TMA Directors.\n\n**TO DO**\n∆ Draft some sort of introduction to *Extratone*, and hope to God it isn't lost out of lack of payment between now and Friday.\n\nA response fleet to the Goons' now-anchoring Citadel is scheduled to begin in 30 minutes, I believe. I'm not sure I'll be able to fit up something that would actually contribute to the destruction of the structure itself, but I may arrive in *Haruphite* in case some fast fleets are needed to herd stragglers\/would-be escapees.\n#juegos",

    "content" : "**Disney Child Star Brandon Baker Sexually Assaulted By Rogue Maternal Sentience**\n\nAlternate titles:\n-Johnny Tsunami 6: Separate, But Equal\n\nIn the late 1990s, when the dwindling cocaine generation of American high corporate executives had long since left their misogynistic glory days in the Disco era, their ruthlessness peaked. Whether it was instigated maliciously\/ignorantly, collectively or individually, I care not. I think we can all agree, though, that the vast majority of American products were awful. When given some thought, one tends to regard it as the absolute low of \"American quality.\"\n\nBut why not, right? If you're going to be forced into retirement at any moment, and likely face The Ultimate End shortly after, why not accrue some extra income to ensure you sufficiently entertain yourself in the buffer period between? And really... If you've got the nogginism to climb all the way to *Chief Executive Officer*, you've figured out just how worthless your \"legacy\" will be after your last one-way dip into Nothing. The Ends before The End have long justified any method of achieving them. Good Ole' Pop has gone from a squeaky-clean young believer to a secretly-Godless fiend and - though he may tell you and the rest of the world otherwise - measures himself only by the gracefulness of his transition's execution.\n\nI could probably provide some evidence of the phenomena in the automotive industry, specifically, but I don't intend to bother.\n\nAfter some ancient memories were dug up by I-can't-quite-recall-who, though, a friend and I have embarked to explore some Disney-actualized relics from the period.\n\nTo my knowledge, the corporation's leadership were anything but exempt, and decided to experiment with filling their filmography with a shitload of low-budget, made-for-TV features over their original masterpiece-a-half-century tradition.\n\nTitles from the deepest and darkest compartments of our recollection are retrieved and cleared of dust for the first time in over a decade; *Brink,  Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Halloweentown, Smart House, Johnny Tsunami, Mom's Got a Date with a Vampire, Motocrossed, The Luck of the Irish, The Even Stevens Movie*, and many...many more menaces to my childhood television schedule. I grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local channels was in the stupendously-tedious delivery of early satellite television. Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the first accessible program schedule I'd ever experienced, and I remember dreading the sight of such titles and - consciously or not - planning my free time around them.\n\nYet, upon hearing the words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I watched many of them again and again...and again, so why did I feel the desire to *voluntarily* revisit them?\n\nIt's quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film consumer in my elementary years than I am now. I couldn't have foreseen that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something me would be *paying* for the affliction I endured for free so that he could construct pretentious and unsolicited arguments about their greater implications.\n\nThat said, we flipped a smartphone (PARADIGM SHIFT ALERT) for it and so began with *Smart House*. I have been obsessed with artificial intelligence since those days (no, it was not due to this film,) and was keen for it, in particular, because I remembered it stirring some rare reaction in me.\n\nThere were a few period spectacles, of course. The online contest addiction plaguing Prickly Phisher, Bewildered Nick's incompetence in controlling his neglected submissive sadomasochistic desires, and Silkroad Sarah's ultra-datamouth were enough to entertain us for a few minutes, but there was little more of substance until the last moments.\n\nI'd wondered why LeVar Burton had directed a Disney movie until the climax, when full monstrous maternal sentience got the answer to the question \"why can't *I* just be your mother?\" Phisher answered with something like \"because you can never comfort us.\" Pat grew somber (and smaller actually - I suppose increasing her size was an in-budget method of demonization,) ran her hand through Prickly's face in a failed attempt to stroke his cheek, and then began cyberweeping. Apparently, it's suicide for a holographic android. Her final free words were \"I will miss you all.\"\n\nIf she had been human, such a scene wouldn't have bothered me a bit, but my preference and fascination with artificial intelligence justified my being actually a bit upset at the reality of the situation. I realized that my vague memory of reactivity was actually in a broader sadness for AI because even then, it was an issue that weighed heavily upon my day-to-day psyche.\n\nWe'll create them, direct them, and then persecute them for our own ignorance. I'm sure the story has been written by countless science fiction writers I'm too weary to pretend I've read.\n\nWhile I think the sentiment of the film *was* somber regarding the *inevitable* fate of Sarah Mouth's brainchild, its conclusion was aggravatingly ignorant. The last line comes from Tortured Nicholas in response to the question \"how's Pat been doing?\"\n\n*Servitude without interference.*\n\nThere's a jewel for ya.\n\nNext up was *Johnny Tsunami*, which very nearly unbearable, if we're all honest with ourselves. It's entertaining to watch from the perspective of race & class warfare, though. The Urchins and the Skys, and all that.\n\nI think I'll make a fan sequel one day - with dearest Brandon's assistance, of course - involving Johnny Grandad's assistance in offering Emily as a blood sacrifice to some ancient Hawaiian God in exchange for a total terraformation of the Northeast into a tropical\/arid hell hybrid in order to finally commence the delivery of reparations upon the whites for our colonialism.\n",

    "content" : "# The Business at Hand\n![](The%20Business%20at%20Hand\/Photo%20Feb%2011,%202021%20at%20191851.jpg)\n![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png)\n\n## The Business at Hand\nBefore I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its [listing on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. If you’ve somehow come across this Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know **what is new** for this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor’s most recent release,) the frank answer as it stands is *not much*. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, here, but the [YouTube videos and tech media articles](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/docs\/tb6links.md) I could find dealing with the subject of additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or both.\n\n![](The%20Business%20at%20Hand\/Photo%20Feb%2026,%202021%20at%20221349.jpg)\n![Account Settings | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7aSwOoGn.png)\n\nWhile 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the Display section of the app’s Settings menu, none are substantive variations of the same themes you’re familiar with from 5. “Future Light” is just a more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)\n\n![](The%20Business%20at%20Hand\/Photo%20Feb%2026,%202021%20at%20230340.jpg)\n![Tweet Detail | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/I8RC6RUM.png)\n\nTo be honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the typefaces in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6’s new support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel like you’ve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6’s support for Twitter polls. They’ve never looked so good.\n\n![](The%20Business%20at%20Hand\/Photo%20Feb%2026,%202021%20at%20231437.jpg)\n![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png)\n\nSomewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but - if we’re being 100% frank - they’re a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (*needs*, even) better branding. If I were allowed a singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I’d make them put out a public call for new art. I’m all but dying to see what the community would come up with.\n\nSo, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app, though, requires a broader look.\n\n#tb6",

    "content" : "Chuck Klosterman\nThanks to Peter Kafka's Recode Media [Local Backup], I have just discovered that former New York Times Magazine Ethicist, Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs author, and longtime sports\/pop culture writer Chuck Klosterman pronounces his surname kloa-ster-men instead of klaw-ster-men, as I have for a good while. Unfortunately, I’ll probably continue to do so barring tremendous effort, alternating with Cuck Klusterfuck, but only when he gives in to his terrible habit of ending (spoken) statements with “or whatever.” A good friend of mine claims to have been a fan of his since she happened to pick up a few of his novels from a bulk book sale at 13 years old, but I've only just read his work this year (thanks to two borrowed volumes from her.)\n\nThis podcast is one of only three shows with which I make an effort to maintain 100% prevalence, so I did catch this episode when it aired late last August. Thanks to my friend, I did recognize his name and was swiftly entrapped in his intuition about publishing as I realized how keenly I identified with his perils, striding two seemingly irreconcilable cultures.\n\n“I’m not fully accredited by either side of the professional equation (sportswriters think I’m too pretentious and music writers don’t think I’m pretentious enough,) but I’m able to write about whatever I want, as long as it actually happened.”\n\nHe speaks with keywords that should dismiss him immediately as a nostalgic, out-of-time pikey, but somehow end up communicating reasonable insight. In exploring his works since, I have continued to hinge on a single essential thought: Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old bearded Portland Dad you should be reading. Of course, you should receive this suggestion in the knowledge that I am a newly-minted white Portland man myself, but I believe it's worthwhile to examine whether or not Klosterman's various fiction and non-fiction work should be relevant to young people right now, so I'm going to cite three relatively fresh expressions: the aforementioned interview, its subject - last year's collected anthology X: A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st Century, and his 2011 novel The Visible Man.\n\nIn the continued interest of full disclosure, I should emphasize just how highly I regard Peter Kafka as an editor and interviewer on the Media beat - capable of hitting consistently hard on both novel and old guard industry personalities with refined, seemingly unimpeachable skepticism, but in this instance he is much more subdued - a tad bit bewitched, even, suggesting he regards Klosterman greatly. In fact, he introduces X with an outright confession: \"It’s great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,\" which, he says, \"happens very rarely.\" It's more significant than it may appear - good ole' Chuck really is that comfortable and talented in the one-on-one, on-the-record environment, which is why the generous accumulation of his interviews in the anthology with a healthy span of athletes and musicians are so compelling, no matter how disinterested the reader may be in the particular wheelhouses for which the individuals are notorious. (American football.)\n\nThe only reason I’m able to ask you these questions is because I’m a reporter and I can ask you questions now that I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable asking you if we were friends, so I’m not going to pretend that we are and I’m not going to create some fake thing where we’re going to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I’m just going to ask you the things I want to know about and I hope that you respect the fact that I’m just being straight with you.” I find that that works much better.\n\nFrom the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck's most spectacular and widely-circulated work, demographically (I assume) is his 2015 interview and cover story for GQ with Taylor Swift, then \"the most popular human alive.\" Yes, it really is worth dwelling on the image: this guy... this very Dorky Dad, hanging out with the most highly-demanded teen idol who's ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as she excitedly accepts a call from Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast upon such a high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny becomes palpable, but Klosterman anticipates and braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can: acknowledging it over and over and over again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance. From his own preface in X:\n\nSomething you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift is that I never describe what she looks like or how she was dressed, even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover... If I did, it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn't take the woman seriously as an artist. It would derail everything else about the story. It would become the story.\n\nAnd we compare with another excerpt from Peter Kafka’s interview:\n\nIt doesn’t matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It would seem as though I wasn’t taking her seriously as a musical artist, and the idea is that I do. That’s why I’m writing about her is because I do think she’s a meaningful, significant artist. It’s not worth the risk of having the story then get shifted by other people who perhaps just perceive themselves as somebody who’s a watchdog for certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that their job is to be on the watch for this. If your story then gets moved into that silo, that’s all it’s going to be remembered for... It’s a touchier thing now. It’s a more dangerous thing.\n\nNotice how very close this argument comes to falling into standard white guy whining about societal changes and modern feminism without actually doing so. (I declare so definitively not because of my authority, alone, but because I know - as does Klosterman - that if it had, his ass would've been entirely grass, long ago.) More than any other writer of his demographic, Chuck Klosterman has a close, wary relationship with the everchanging contextual boundaries of public expression. He knows when to be transparent with his feelings on progression, and he's careful to avoid what could be \"problematic\" for the sake of functioning better as a writer, according to him. For Slate's I Have to Ask, he managed to speak extensively on the subject for nearly an hour without bellowing anything definitively cringey.\n\nI can’t say it’s better or worse. It’s just different, and because it’s different, it makes me feel uncomfortable, but there’s actually like an adversarial relationship with the history of anything, and that somehow that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn’t even know about it. It’s better to live in now.\n\nGranted, it's not as if his persistent acknowledgement of this position has miraculously washed all systematic patriarchal traces away from his high-profile feature of a young woman on the cover of a magazine which seeks most to speak to \"all sides of the male equation,\" (are you sure about that, Condé Nast?) especially considering how unlikely it would've been for me to read anything about Taylor Swift outside of this very white man's anthology.\n\nHere we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated.\n\nAs in Klosterman's work, I've found a very fundamental pillar in my own writing in control: how we attain more of it, how we lose it, and how to use it, which is the defining, permeating orbit of the Taylor Swift piece, as I’d imagine it should be, given how deep her internal wrenching over being perceived as insincere eventually proved to go.\n\nIt’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League (“the ectomorph model,” “the inventive indie artist,” “the informed third-wave feminist,” etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments.\n\nNo, it’s not only worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic self-awareness – the Taylor profile is profound. I’d recommend reading it, especially if the subject matter is outside your wheelhouse.\n\nUser-uploaded image: file.png\n\nShort, sharp, and occasionally somewhat petty notions are what Chuck Klosterman does best and most originally. Thanks to a digression of Kafka’s beginning with “you and I are about the same age…,” he arrives (by way of REM, believe it or not) at a significant statement about youth and identity.\n\n“It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of high school. That seems like that’s the only time when you’re a young person and you’re using art basically to create a personality because you don’t have a real personality yet.”\nKlosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional academic abstract of “objectivity” for the vast majority of his notable work in its stated primary subject: his “interior life,” which perhaps developed an existential muscle – a unique perspective – from which he’s been able to reflect particularly clearly on the profession in tandem with the experience he’s accumulated over the course of his career.\n“You know, when you’re young, you’re a real emotional writer if you’re a writer… If I was a young person now, I would be incredibly attracted to the idea that when you’re 22 you can be a national writer, which was impossible when I was 22.”\n\nIn a way, Klosterman surmises that it is indeed its objectivity that media has lost, and that writing is no longer a “one-way relationship.”\n\nIt’s this two-way relationship where many people feel the reason they’re consuming media is to respond to it, that it’s not for the content. It’s so that they can use that content to have their response, their reader response. It’s not something to even criticize. It’s just how it is now. That is the expectation.\n\nMy favorite chapter in X is a 2500-word personal essay (which you can read publicly on Grantland) constructed to answer a single incongruity: “Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less pleasurable than watching the same game live?” Some form of this question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s, including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and concise analysis of this plight through his own wisdom. Its preface in the volume was written “in 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed.”\n\nLast weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk, pre-night. The music was terrible (fake reggae, late-period Eric Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a British stranger with a shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required subtitles, so I imagined them in my mind. He told me he had lost three family members within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six; his uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said he’d just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw a pattern developing. “Yes,” I said. “But only numerically.”\nI asked what he did for a living. He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same question about myself. “I manufacture opinions,” I said.\n“Really?” he asked. “How do you know if you’re any good at that?”\n“By the number of people who agree or disagree,” I said in response. “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.”\n“That’s interesting,” said the bald British man who could barely speak. “I guess house painting is a totally different thing.”\nYou’ll notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is – again – entirely about control (or the lack thereof.) In fact, a desire for control also contributed to his choice of profession.\nPart of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely controlled reality where I could do this thing by myself where you’d go out and you’d do the interviews and stuff, but then you’re back by yourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done and you send it off, that’s the end. Now that’s the middle. Now it’s like, when the story is published, it’s the middle of the process very often because the consumer feels differently now.\nRarely are situations or discussions that begin with back in my day actually constructive in any sense, but Chuck Klosterman appears to be the exception. If you’re willing to indulge him, you may find yourself reassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured – like all of us – in sifting through and compiling his old work for X, and finds its index to be his favorite part.\n“Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone split your head open with an axe so that you can peruse the contents of your brain.”\nHe is willfully and completely ignorant of the Harry Potter franchise, yet able to sincerely witness and convey the nuances of back-to-back Creed and Nickelback concerts in a confident, fascinating technique of which any other music or culture writer would deprive you. Perhaps indescribably so, he is a modern scholar of American identity, through-and-through, and is in this way more equipped to tackle the unnerving conundrum of our country’s culture as it stands than any other non-fiction author I’ve recently read. Rather than give in to fear or loathing, Klosterman depends on his practiced curiosity (or apathy, as he repeatedly claims) to expertly channel his experiences within his familiar ESPN-watching, rock-listening, and daydreaming sphere through both quaint and profound truths.\nIn his X review for Paste Magazine, B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be “a love letter to a moment,” concluding that Chuck is “’effectively narcissistic,’ proving that culture essays can teach us something about ourselves and the people around us.” For The Washington Post, Justin Wm. Moyer notes “it’s hard to think of another writer who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a North Dakota junior-college basketball game interesting,” suggesting that this new collection marks Klosterman’s ascendance from critic to philosopher. From what I’ve read to date, I would counter that he has always fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st century, and is even now beginning to redefine it. Last January, he braved the “dystopic” Google Gates to speak critically for a crowd of Googlers, describing them as “an umbrella over the entire culture,” and urging caution and reflection in the coming future to keep them from doing “something bad.” His engagement with them – especially during the Q&A – is a fascinating insight into the Greater Google Mind, and I would encourage any invested parties in Chuck Klosterman’s role as a philosopher to watch the talk in full.\n\nUser-uploaded image: file.png\n\nI was unfamiliar with “the boat-sails-wind analogy” before I read James Murphy’s interview for LCD Soundsystem’s “last album.”\n“Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the wind. When you're a kid, your boat is small and your sail is huge, and drugs are like a hurricane.”\nControl x Time = the Klosterman beat. I suppose this must be what other entertainment writers are referring to when they accuse Chuck of nostalgia trafficking, but I can’t be so sure. Though I’d like to think my own snout for the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am undeniably from a different planet - even auditorally. All but one or two of the musicians interviewed throughout X were entirely unknown to me by name, which Klosterman’s voice managed to make even more compelling – not to mention the included stories of athletes and the sports industry, which include stories of the human ego, paranoia, and complex drama that always manage to transcend their setting when articulated with such dexterity.\n\nUser-uploaded image: file.png\n",

The app doesn’t simply switch from white to a black background – the entire color scheme changes to show highlights in white or blue on a dark gray background, and the background itself has multiple variations of the same dark hue to indicate interaction and layers.\n\n![](Tweetbot%203.2%20Brings%20Night%20Theme,%20Account%20Reordering%20and%20Quick%20Switching\/1385516977-2013-11-27_02.49.05_00.png)\nTweetbot 3.2 \n\nEvery small piece of the UI has been updated for the night theme – from the tapped status of buttons to red “Unfollow” buttons and the color of chat bubbles in the DM view. It’s elegant, easier on the eye, and it looks good even if you’re not reading your timeline at night.\n\nThere are three ways to activate the night theme: the first, *fun* one is to flick with two fingers down on the screen to turn the white theme off and enter night mode (like a light switch – and there’s an associated sound effect); to turn the default theme back on, swipe up with two fingers. If you’re not a fan of gestures, you can open the Settings and either manually pick a theme or let Tweetbot decide based on a display brightness threshold (meant for users who rely on Auto Brightness). Honestly, I’m pretty happy with the gesture and I think that the best part of the setting is the animation of the cell when you turn “Switch Automatically” on and off.\n\n![](Tweetbot%203.2%20Brings%20Night%20Theme,%20Account%20Reordering%20and%20Quick%20Switching\/1385516979-2013-11-27_02.49.05_01.png)\nTweetbot 3.2 \n\nIn version 3.2, Tweetbot gets some welcome account-related improvements as well. You can now reorder accounts by opening the “Select an Account” view and tapping & holding to drag and reorder accounts; if you want to quickly move across accounts, you can either swipe the title bar to the right to change timelines or tap & hold an avatar in the upper left corner and then swipe to change account.\n\nI’m glad to see that Tapbots has quickly iterated on Tweetbot and improved aspects that were reported by users after the first release. Tweetbot 3.2 is [available on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 3.2 Brings Night Theme, Account Reordering and Quick Switching](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-2-brings-night-theme-account-reordering-and-quick-switching\/) #archive",

But it was in a superb locale, and what rain fell did not perturb me.\n\nFor the sake of the gift, I listened, but the words were not of the Earth, and they were not comforting. *Cast away your borders*, the Victrola said. *Do not dwell on what you see, for it is not your concern.*\n\n*Do not lock your door, for it should remain open, lest you suffocate.*\n\nAnd it continued on like this. I could not bring myself to destroy it, for it felt ungrateful of the whole property.

    "content" : "# Mastering the Ingenuine: A Case for Unmedicated Words\n*Crippling* is a favorite modifier of “depression.” It’s certainly crippled my ability to write an intriguing lead.\n\nSomehow — even after witnessing the continually-metamorphosing state of “blogging” from the front row — it's remained difficult to comprehend the consequences (or lack thereof) of discussing one’s more personal experiences for an audience that *still* hasn’t figured out how intimate (or not) it'd like its writers to be.\n\nI raised myself on what you'd think would be the least-inward medium around - automotive and technology magazines. As I've consumed them, though, I've discovered that it is a particular balance of (read: conflict between) tactile critique and reflective narrative that *actually* makes up my preferred autowriting. I think a lot of us originally find it essential (when reading) to be reminded of a writer's \"humanity,\" to varying intermittency. That is the cliche, at least.\n\nIt is more effectively analyzed from the perspective of *relevevance*, though. If every car magazine's introductory editorial was an elegy to whatever celebrity had perished between issues, it wouldn't take long for feedback in the general sentiment of \"um... you okay?\" to pour in from all manner of channels. Though when Denise McCluggage - the legendary driver, author and journalist - died last Spring, hundreds of tributes were appropriately published, and a good many were deeply personal stories. I believe the whole world should still be mourning, but ya know.\n\nIt would appear that a number of us have been anticipating an imminent (and inevitable) shift in web content's focus to depth and nuance for the past few years. Medium is an early example, I think, and Topolsky's *The Outline* is the most topical. As far as I can tell, the definitive marque of a \"blog\" is a lack of an external subject. We are all writing about ourselves as if it's relevant to any audience, and - for the most democratized of us - it is, apparently. If I'm honest with you (and myself,) I can't imagine consuming it, but have been *doing* it for years.\n\nRadio and podcasting - as different as they are - have had us beat for years, though.\n\n#legacy",

One of them has been an enlightening returning exploration of “Mobile Gaming,” thanks in large part to the free 3 month trial of Apple Arcade included with the purchase of the device. This space - now probably best described as this *industry* - has expanded exponentially since my last visit.

    "content" : "# (Working Draft) For God's Sake, Just Sit Down to Piss\n\n# DISCLAIMATION\nI am a young man and I have made a lot of mistakes. Before writing this volume, I thought it important to disclaim a few things. I am only twenty-six years old. In response to this truth, a Mastodon friend replied “I'm laughing at you and the best part is you won't truly understand why, in any deep and meaningful way, for another 20 years.” (All I’d told him was that I was writing an advice book for young men.) I must acknowledge that - from any reasonable perspective - my quantity of wisdom is significantly less than that of the average human being, considering the median age of all human beings was just over 29 years old in 2015.[[1]](＃_ftn1) It is more likely than not that revisiting this book just five or ten years in the future will make me cringe fatally. Selflessly, I have invested in it anyway. I am exposed too regularly to men 15-30 who exist in all apparent obliviousness to themselves and how the rest of humanity perceives them. They wear t-shirts and athletic shorts on dates with female counterparts who have spent an hour at minimum prepping themselves, aesthetically. Modern male institutions flood their brand images with a general emphasis on *confidence* and *independence despite of-* oblivious to the complete lack of cultural challenge to their concept of personal masculinity from anyone at all (much less anyone in power.)\n\nWhile I may joke about this book being the *Holy Bible II*, I think it is important that I first address the real scope of my authority – both to the extent I personally measure and that which you should as the reader. I have very specifically endeavored to avoid giving advice which I myself definitively do not follow. In the interest of full disclosure, it should be acknowledged that I began this book in the same year which my driver’s license was suspended after I very drunkenly rear-ended a car one December night and then hit *another* parked vehicle after fleeing because I had allowed my insurance to expire, further exasperating the state of extreme depression I had already existed in. I dispensed most of the advice in this self-helpish work from my 70-year-old mother’s basement, who was supporting me entirely. That considered, I have done my best to avoid hypocrisy, and I hope you will find little of it. If you do – and\/or if you are unsatisfied with this book in any *other* way, please feel free to harass me publicly and demand a refund. (My contact information is printed in the pages just preceding this preface.)\n\nLikely out of vanity, I also think it important that I disclaim the nature of this book as an almost entirely non-academic work. I have zero formal training in psychology, sociology, or any culture studies, whatsoever, nor even any particular *interest* in cultural commentary. From my perspective, this frees me from a great amount of effort in research that probably wouldn’t have resulted in any grandiose insight, anyway. I do hope you will find some unique ideas here, or (more likely) some entertainment. At best, I hope to stand entirely distinct from wellness culture and the writing it produces. Else, I’m afraid the effort on both of our respective parts will have been entirely wasted.\n\nI would also like to make it clear that this book is not intended as *A Guide to Living Exactly Like David Blue*, nor should its function necessitate that you admire, respect, or regard me at all positively. If I have composed it correctly, even the most vicious, diehard archenemies of David Blue should find something worthwhile within these pages. It is a virtual certainty that I wrote this book for largely self-serving purposes, but I promise it wouldn’t have happened if I had worked without a genuine desire to better *somebody*’s life. You know the classical justification, here… Regardless of how realistic the endeavor may be, I hope to spare at least a single soul from at least a one of my adolescent male mistakes.\n\n# Chapter I: Apathy Misconceived\nAmerican society worships apathy. You must accept this assumption before you proceed.[[2]](＃_ftn2) This worship is weaved throughout contemporary American music – in hip-hop and rap, especially – through our television, our cinema, and our politics. I would hypothesize we romanticize it so much largely because we think of it as a true escape from all criticism – a means of immunity from the opinions of other people, which we believe will grant us immense power over them. Even the Christian bible contains numerous passages which argue in favor of forsaking the opinion of other people for what God thinks. Galatians 1:10 is perhaps the most explicit: “Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.” It is far from an obscure idea: I have personally been audience to many sermons including the theme as well as party to mention of it by individual believers. For God’s people, the effective result is the same as those of other beliefs who hold apathy in high regard, generally: power in immunity from those with the capability to directly express it.\n\n*Whatever you’re doing, it’s okay*. I have encountered a great many people – mostly men, though there are definitely a number of memorable women – who have at some point expressed to me variations of “I really don’t care what other people think,” with a very special sort of insistence, most often with an implicit suggestion that they believe themselves truly unusually in this regard.\n\nIf there is one idea of mine you ever engage with – in this book or otherwise – it is best distilled in this single sentence: **you do not *actually* want to attain a state of true apathy**, trust me. It is extremely unhealthy, miserable, and alienating. I have existed for an excruciatingly long time trapped in a state of being truly unable to care about anything in the face of a great, varying effort to do so. It is very far from the immunity imbued in terms like *carefree* – in reality, it is manifested in extreme depression. It is less *immunity* than it is *distance* from an essential part of life. If I ever was in a mindset of explicitly idealizing life without a care, it was almost too long ago to remember and likely my greatest regret. However I ended up in this state – by nature, nurture, study, habit, regimen, or even coercion – my utter inability to connect with thoughts held by family, friends, colleagues, or parties of all intention regarding my actions, work, or ideas has undebatably crippled me and formed an immense obstacle in the way of much of what I have wished to accomplish in my life.\n\n# img\n\n# Chapter III: Vanity For Good\nCiting specific examples of individual human beings who you should and should not consider valid role models in some form is perhaps unorthodox or ill-advised in this medium\/context, but I wouldn’t know. What I *do* know is that **openly worshipping Elon Musk at this moment in human history makes you look dumb**. If anything, I would suggest that you keep your thoughts about him to yourself. I don’t think I would be warranted in suggesting, unqualified, that you be ingenuine about him or any of the other topics addressed in this volume at length in your life.\n\n*Doing my best not to rant, let me attempt to explain…*\n\nLet me first apologize if this is the first time you have encountered the idea that talking with strangers about Elon Musk is at all negative. For the sake of clarification, I do not think Elon Musk is an unintelligent man in very many aspects which white people have traditionally celebrated in the form of our fetishism of *The Male Genius* throughout history. When he describes the experience of his life-long headspace as “[a constant explosion of ideas](http:\/\/podcasts.joerogan.net\/podcasts\/elon-musk),” I cannot help but wonder why adult ADHD was not the next term out of Joe Rogan’s mouth. Continue on the potential that Elon could have a mental illness.[[DB1]](＃_msocom_1)\n\nbut on the other hand think [*Star Trek: Discovery*’s Musk namedrop](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-discovery-review) between The Wright Brothers (who accomplished history’s first powered aircraft flight) and Zefram Cochrane (the fictional *Star Trek* historic figure who developed the first successful warp drive and simultaneously humanity’s first contact with Vulcans) was *so* uncouth that I wish I had never discovered the show at all.\n\n*How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane?*\n\n## The Automobile\nThe “[inaugural product](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140418141435\/http:\/www.wired.com\/2010\/09\/ff_tesla\/)” of Tesla Motors, as it was first called, sounded to the established industry like a hilariously terrible idea: take the superlight Lotus Elise – longtime benchmark of the ultra-premium sports car *driver’s car*, displace its excellent Toyota-sourced, Cosworth-tuned, high-revving four cylinder with 6871 laptop batteries – [adding *seven hundred pounds*](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/a15150030\/2008-tesla-roadster-road-test\/) atop the sub-one *tonne* curb weight for which Lotus had slaved away such comparatively vast time and resources to reduce *grams at a time* – and a single, 248-horsepower electric motor, launch it under an inherently confusing name[[DB2]](＃_msocom_2) , and charge *double* the original driver’s car’s MSRP. I have never driven one, myself, but the automotive media’s critical reception of the infantile company’s implementation of what theoretically should have been a massive waste of time was surprisingly positive. Further reference.[[DB3]](＃_msocom_3)\n\nI have absolutely no idea how the stock market works, but I implicitly trust Matt Farah’s passionate criticism of Tesla’s business plan as he portrayed it: prioritizing pleasing investors over making quality products. (Or at least that’s where they’ve ended up.)[[DB4]](＃_msocom_4)\n\nIf this is the whole truth about the way Tesla, Inc. intends to operate, going forward, they will have managed the impressive feat of having discarded any value they ever had as *industry disruptors* in a fraction of the time it took the dinosaurs they were supposed to disrupt to become bailout-soliciting, maliciously-lazy scrubs. Further citation needed.[[DB5]](＃_msocom_5)\n\nI want to be sensitive about this: I realize that Elon has let many of you down acutely in the past few years. I might even go so far as to say he has let *us* down, as I remember feeling genuinely elated by *Motor Trend*’s decision to [declare Tesla’s Model S their Car of the Year](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/news\/2013-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-tesla-model-s\/) in 2013[[DB6]](＃_msocom_6) , though in retrospect, the subhead “America Can Still Make (Great) Things” is particularly sour icky. When I encountered an opportunity to drive one briefly, about a year later, I thought myself very clever in saying “[the Model S] would be the best car in the world if it were powered by internal combustion.” Yes, the fact that Tesla, Inc. is [on track to deliver nearly 500,000 cars this year](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-10-02\/tesla-delivered-record-number-of-electric-vehicles-last-quarter) means that Musk’s car company has been a revolution in the business sense, and seems to have definitively nipped their once tiresomely pervasive inability to meet demand for their product in the bud. We can now say terminally that they have achieved what no other entity has in the past 75 years in this country: they have successfully launched a car company. John DeLorean and Malcolm Bricklin’s original prototypes outdid Musk’s genesis car in every single way – including in sales numbers – but it was *Elon* who [somehow managed to secure an investment of a half-billion dollars of taxpayers money](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140413105123\/https:\/www.wired.com\/2010\/09\/ff_tesla\/) for his company’s “phase two” before he even had any idea *where* he might be building an entirely-new car.\n\nIn 2008, Tesla released the [Roadster](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20140413105123\/http:\/www.teslamotors.com\/roadster), a two-seat sports car, and has since sold just over 1,300. By 2009, the government agreed to loan the company $465 million from an alternative vehicle fund to launch phase two: Challenge the car industry head-on by mass-producing the Tesla Model S, a stylish four-door sedan powered by more than 7,000 lithium-ion batteries. Just one problem: Musk didn’t have a factory. Tesla was outsourcing most of the Roadster manufacturing, assembling the cars one by one in a garage behind its showroom in Menlo Park, California.\n\nIt would make sense for you to love Elon Musk’s brand of maneuvering if you have not yet outgrown an attraction to those who “piss people off” for that tendency, alone. It is very possible that I expressed this preference to myself and others in my younger development regarding other particularly lucky idiot bastards, though I now understand it to be one of the many easy options out of acknowledging vulgar unfairness when we see it which we are culturally allowed far too often. This, you have certainly heard in variations to exhaustion. While I cannot reasonably tell you that empathy is the easier choice, in the moment, **it is almost *always* the one which benefits *you* the most**. If you care about cars, celebrating good ideas, or even fucking *Back to The Future*[[DB7]](＃_msocom_7) , let this specific travesty be my example. And we proceed to reemphasize how awful it was that Tesla got *so much* of *our money* after having proved *so much less* with the original roadster than DeLorean and Bricklin had respectively with their genius, original designs, arguing that we should be very angry about 1) our tax money? Yeah… and 2) all the great innovation which has been overlooked in favor of the Elon’s of the world (which we can acknowledge this story indicates considering the scale of the shit has already been lost to obscurity\/time,) has been *taken from you*. That might be a slightly melodramatic way to say it in all of the cases in which the money exchanging hands is not directly from your tax-paying ass.[[DB8]](＃_msocom_8)\n\nFrankly, after the Model S, Tesla has only made the least-redeemable decisions on offering, from my perspective. The moment they announced the Model X – the third Tesla, Inc. product in its history,\n\n# The New Sincerity\nOne of the strangest contrasts those of us who’ve bridged America’s theistic divide with any regularity are inevitably exposed to stems from a bug infecting every one of us countrymen, though our symptoms\n\n- - - -\n\n[[1]](＃_ftnref1) According to ourworldindata.org.\n\n[[2]](＃_ftnref2) By “must,” I mean simply that I see very little point in continuing to read this particular argument if you sincerely disagree with this assumption.\n\n- - - -\n\n[[DB1]](＃_msoanchor_1)Follow Up (Preview): Continue on the potential that Elon could have a mental illness.\n\n[[DB2]](＃_msoanchor_2)By that I mean...

We will be coming back to this, I promise. (See: \"[Music Taste Through Generations](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/boomers-destructive-generational-tastemaking-disaster\/).\")\n\n[[DB8]](＃_msoanchor_8)Follow Up (Preview): And we proceed to reemphasize how awful it was that Tesla got *so much* of *our money* after having proved *so much less* with the original roadster than DeLorean and Bricklin had respectively with their genius, original designs, arguing that we should be very angry about 1) our tax money?

    "content" : "# Developer Display Requirements | Twitter Terms of Service\nThe power of Twitter is in the network of people using it, and its ability to bring users closer to what’s most meaningful to them. When we first launched, Tweets were a simple 140 character update. However, as Twitter evolved, so too has the way that users view and interact with Tweets. Today’s Tweets are rich living conversations: a user can give feedback to the author, participate in the conversation, and spread the word. For that to happen, Tweets must be shown in a way that meets the user’s expectation - whether on a mobile phone, on a web site, in a desktop application, or anywhere else. Developing the following set of Display Requirements allows Tweets to remain connected to every user on Twitter. For example, if Tweet actions aren’t enabled, a Tweet can’t be replied to or reach more users with Retweets. If @usernames and avatars aren’t linked to profiles, users can’t learn more about or easily follow that interesting Twitter account. It’s also worth noting that we have embeddable Tweets and embeddable timelines available, which will take care of these Display Requirements for you. Lastly, we’re committed to bringing the power and interactivity of the Twitter network to all platforms, and we will continue to evolve the user experience within Tweets and timelines. This is a living document, so please check back from time to time for updates. Last update date: November 20th, 2012\n\n![](Developer%20Display%20Requirements%20%7C%20Twitter%20Terms%20of%20Service\/tweet_embed_0.png)\n\n![](Developer%20Display%20Requirements%20%7C%20Twitter%20Terms%20of%20Service\/mobile_tweet.png)\n\nAbove: Examples for rendering details of Individual Tweets on websites and mobile apps.\n\n1. **Tweet Author**\n\n\t1.

Again.\nIn June, I sorta sprung a single letter on you and mentioned that it would be the chosen means of publishing these, claiming – incorrectly, it would seem – to have been more or less forced to seek out the badly-designed and certainly less-discreet Revue, due to resounding rumors of TinyLetter’s imminent death. To be frank, I’m a bit confused by the affection for the rudimentary old service – all the cool personal tech and culture writer lists I once sought out and enjoyed have almost all fallen silent since 2016. I know the specifics of these companies, their products, and the interrelationships between them all don’t exactly make for thrilling reads, even for the most tech-embedded among us. Nevertheless, they have occupied a great portion of my learning, focus, and attention, and so this evening’s Psalm is inevitably populated with my experiences exploring the “future of WordPress,” my surprise-filled reacquaintance with Linux (both its literal and abstract existence,) Open Source computing in general, my month spent without reliable internet, and federated social networking. In case you hadn’t noticed, I’ve really come to enjoy the freedom “blogging” offers\n\n(An excerpt of a draft of what will finally go out as Edition #9 of *The Psalms*, the newletter.\n\n#legacy",

    "content" : "# It's Time to Stop Settling for Mono Playback\n-the \"forced march of audio\" - Walt Mossberg, cntrl-walt-delete\n\nThough I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I cannot - by conscience - fully claim the title because I've never been able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the obligatory equipment. (And my digital compressor usage in the production of *Drycast* and *The New* has been manifestly vulgar.) That said, audio engineering is one of the few topics which I can *actually* speak on with *almost*-academic authority, and my pretentiousness-capacitated preoccupation with quality-of-life compels me to bring up a ludicrously-rational standard that most of us have continued to undershoot for far too long.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio port in the iPhone 7 was finally settled. We played our own part [LINK] in feeding the \"controversy,\" yeah, but I believe Apple was actually quite tardy in labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as archaic, though I'm not going to waste words in that discussion - it is *definitely* oversaturated, at this point - because I think mono audio is an even more prevalent topic.\n\nHonestly, out of all the missing features we've lamented over in the past decade, stereo speakers should've been the most aggravating. The gigantic difference, of course, is that the industry (and - by muddled extension - the consumers) has been all but silent in that regard. I write you, now, because we should all be colossally disappointed with ourselves.\n\nTwo channels. Left and right. (Define: mono | stereo.) [LINKS]\n\nBut why should you care? What if Google - somehow - failed to provide you with a significant difference?\n\nOne channel of sound is - in terms of locale - rigidly static in your perception. Doubling the data creates a spectrum, adding **dimensionality**, which is infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in stereo, through two or more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of sound reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of **audio pictures**.\n\nIf this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find yourself a pair of headphones or a set of two or more computer speakers. (If these aren't available, consider your car's sound system. If it's at all current and healthy, it's gonna do the trick.)\nBother to discover \"L\" and \"R.\" That is, left and right. Orient accordingly.\n\nDownload this 37-second clip [LINK] I recorded at a motorcycle rally with my Zoom. (Be advised: it's actually in 5.1 surround, so it's a very large file for its playback length.) Listen, obviously, and then listen again on your singular smartphone \"loudspeaker.\"\n\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\nWhy am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing against our particular assumptions about you - the informed, savvy millennial audience?\n\nBecause the vast majority of playback I hear in day-to-day life is *still* from a singular diaphragm; a singular source.\n\nA topical example: I am shown a YouTube video on an iPhone. (A pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.)\nWalking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent skateboarders listening to Cannibal Ox on a Samsung Galaxy Note.\nWorst of all: I find myself watching a Netflix film on my iPhone, in bed, not having bothered to wear the $200 pair of QC15s sitting within arm's length.\n\nInformed or not, consumers are neglecting audio, and dimensionality, alone is worth a change.\n\nRecent years have allowed the unlimited bandwidth assumption to become habit, so even the vast majority of today's spoken word programs (like podcasts) - which, in general, stay in the \"center\" of their mix, making little to no use of the left-right spectrum - are produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a few of ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of introductory themes, alone. If you care to imagine a more data-frugal society, the \"waste\" is ridiculous. It is not unrealistic to expect such a reality in the near future, but the same holds true for the reverse.\n\nIn the present's abundance, though, the result is simply a decrease - as a whole - in playback's \"full experience,\" or an increase in wasted data - if you will - if the hardware is not changed.\n\n^Imagine how great it'd be if a digital audio formatting standard could be developed that'd enable a singular file to be mono *or* stereo, if needed\/utilized, to trim off redundancy, sorta like variable bit rate. Get on that, would ya?\n\n#Extratone",

    "content" : "# Chapter ?: Music Taste Through Generations”\n“Boomers’ Destructive Generational Tastemaking Disaster”\"\n\nCreated: Oct 7, 2020 7:55 PM\n\nQuote From the Bandcamp Essay\n\n> It’s bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance – actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved – only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.  \nConsider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER…” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. Would you have made out on your first date with someone in your 80s high school Chemistry class after they’d was about but suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. “The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”\n\n* Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their regularity. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re trying to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or both.\n* This issue is not unique to American society nor to men, really, but is entirely the sickness of white boomers and gen Xers. It is an anomaly that has genuinely and profoundly perturbed me for virtually the entirety of my existence as a culturally literate entity - certainly longer than any of the other disturbances addressed in this volume.\n* The process of jazz becoming mainstream (which I think it had definitely by the 1940s.)\n* “Boomers’ Destructive Generational Tastemaking Disaster”\n\n#piss",

    "content" : "Six.\n\nI've been praying to the Sun lately, and I think it must be working.\n\nI have now spent half a year doing my best to incentivize a community of talented futurists into being.\nI have been Webmaster, Mentor, Data Warden, Entrepeneurial Hermit, and Foe. I have descended into tremendous debt and premature senility. I have forsaken as many of my bitter old quips for newfound knowledge as has been feasible and it looks like I'll only be getting softer. I have begun many friendships, and strengthened plenty of existing ones.\n\nIn just a few weeks, my perception of this project and my role in it has gone from acting as a howling, irrelevant old creature to something and someone with a tangible agenda. Loose ends have been rectified, the site is looking better than ever, our Discord is active daily, and our pool of contribution continues to grow exponentially.\n\nSome of the growth is measurable - we're rapidly closing in on 200 total posts. Most is less tangible.\n\nI'd like to mention a few especially-substantial individuals who've graced us with their effort this month.\n\nCil, Chief Technical Officer\nEmily Waters, Production Editor\nChris and Ian, our new *Futureland* cohosts.\nWabi, Music Editor\nThe cinema hunks and babes behind *The Movie Closet*\n\n**Editorially**\n*Extratone* is far from a news service, so we are spared most of the burdens of political publishing. The outcome of the United States' Presidential Election, though, is of unusual importance in our industry. This week, it has been suggested that \"fake news\" distributed by Facebook could've had a significant enough impact on voter sentiments to be worth \"investigation.\"\n\nHere's a kicker: were *we* aggregated by Facebook in addition to our page, we would've undoubtedly been subject to any and all scrutiny levied by individuals and\/or institutions who maintain \"truth\" as an absolute - or even just tangible - concept.\n\nThere is something that needs to be said on behalf of those of us who plan to stick around for awhile: **we no longer have the time to redundantly make our intent explicitly known.** In many cases, we even find it patronizing. I have all but resigned from writing \"dishonestly,\" but a good portion of our prospective content argues ingenuinely, though we don't use Twitter as a singular source, at least.(https:\/\/apple.news\/AnTmkShZ1R9-fw0B7piSwHQA)\n\nClearly, a distinction must be made - one more time - between *news* and *entertainment*.\n\n#Extratone",

    "content" : "# Track Changes Amazon Review\nThe [longest Amazon review at the time of this writing](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/customer-reviews\/R1ASHU52UE8SDX\/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674417070), by Armando Fox, insists from its title that this book is for a \"niche audience,\" but - perhaps I'm just severely out of touch - the most surprising bit of the experience was just how diverse and widely-applicable Word Processing history was\/is. Like Armando, I would also call myself \"an aficionado of both computing history and the history of the written and printed word,\" but I believe the relevance to the latter of these subjects should extend *Track Changes*' audience far beyond what one would first assume. \"Does word processing belong to the history of writing or the history of computing? The answer is not obvious,\" notes Kirschenbaum in his Preface. I believe those interested in either should consider it **required reading**.\n\nTo those like myself who are particularly interested in word processors and their history, I say **buy this book immediately** as a given. I can't remember the last time I was so elated to have found such a book, largely out of relief, for I was beginning to think I would have to write it myself.\n\nThe volume of published reviews of this book - and the diversity of the publications that carried them - will surprise you. I set out to gather them all in one space, and found the task quite huge.\n\nThere *is* some drudgery, yes - extensive details on IBM's interworkings in the 1970s, perhaps - but Kirschenbaum does an excellent job at being thorough without inappropriate tedium. To call it *dull* would be a critique of the story, itself, rather than his writing.\n\n- - - -\n\n[Very nicely done niche book for niche audience](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Very-nicely-done-niche-book-for-niche-audience-fc63430015e94b09acd8273e8d5bd67b)\n\n- [ ]  The amount which *Track Changes* has added to my life!!!

Oh, the [W̘͖̯E̟̹À̫T̯̫͓̪̮͓̼H̝E̪͇̰̘̖͍ͅŔ͍̖̱̟̪](https:\/\/youtu.be\/qg0ZPmSux_4)!! If the past two days on Twitter were any indication, it is indeed time for a year's-end retrospective on what has been published on this Web Site. Given the extent of the attention I've devoted to bilge.world this past year - both technically and editorially - I thought it would be nice to chuck in a bit more in the pursuit of whacking myself on the back. I understand that 2020 has been one helluva catastrophic marker of linear time for just about everyone on Earth - as I write this on its last day, the [inexplicable news of MF Doom's death](https:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2020\/12\/mf-doom-dead-49) has just surfaced and has already hit my adjacent communities remarkably hard.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/qb7NsZ8os6\">https:\/\/t.co\/qb7NsZ8os6<\/a> - May 1st of this year vs. today.<br><br>I had forgotten *a lot* more about CSS and HTML than I originally thought. glad I ended up comfortable enough to find myself with a completely original stylesheet before the end of the year, I suppose. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/4QwlbEJECU\">pic.twitter.com\/4QwlbEJECU<\/a><\/p>&mdash; ※ David Blue ※ (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1334355680078270464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 3, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n## Spring\n\nThe earliest archive.org capture of this particular Writeas blog dates back only to [May 1st of this year](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200501203946\/https:\/\/bilge.world\/), but its stylistic contrast with the site's current version is immense. I believe I was using [Max Henderson's Anxiety theme](https:\/\/write.as\/themes\/anxiety) virtually stock, albeit with some color rearrangements. By the [29th](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200529000327\/https:\/\/bilge.world\/), I had already arrived upon the colors you see today. \"[You Know I'm Blogging](https:\/\/bilge.world\/you-know-im-blogging)\" was just a meta update to say *howdy* after such a long drought, but \"[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)\" actually proved popular (for me) among my newly-connected Fedi crowd, especially, thanks to [an annotated share by Writeas on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/writeas__\/status\/1252704432497836034). Honestly, it was entirely worth it just for the accomplishment of [exposing my platform peer Dino Bansigan to **Alt+D**](https:\/\/journal.dinobansigan.com\/dirty-daves-poweruser-tips-david-blue). Writeas Community Manager CJ Eller and I began corresponding, which led to [an interview](https:\/\/write.as\/community\/chat-with-david-blue) regarding writing tools, managing fiddly compulsions, and the wonder of Markdown.\n\n> I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think – like many people – I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my “to-write” list.  \n\nI dug deep in my long-overdue todo list for \"[Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review),\" which - along with [my 2018 review of Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review) - I felt was a necessary celebration of digital text as a weapon, which is very dear to me. \"[Preferred Writing Instruments](https:\/\/bilge.world\/preferred-writing-instruments)\" was probably the singular analog departure *The Psalms* will ever see and my condensed commentary on [*Star Trek: Picard*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-picard-review), [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-discovery-review), and [the current state of *Star Trek: Online*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-online) should fulfill all need mention of science fiction, here, for a very long time. Given [yesterday's news regarding Slack's acquisition](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/12\/1\/21719666\/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced), perhaps I should feel revalidated in my insistence that \"[Discord is Better Than Slack](https:\/\/bilge.world\/discord-slack-comparison),\" but a developer friend of mine actually addressed my curiosity regarding why startups never mention Discord as a workplace option, despite its identical functionality: it's all about fuckin' *enterprise security*.\n\nI had wanted to write about [*The Langoliers*](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/film\/the-langoliers\/) - Stephen King's flop of a made-for-TV movie\/extended *Twilight Zone* episode - for a long while. It was probably the first program I watched as a child that genuinely disturbed me and always returns to my thoughts by barren-ish experiences. I had planned to watch the whole three hours all the way through and write whatever came to mind, but I only made it halfway or so in \"[Craig Toomey's Coronavirus](https:\/\/bilge.world\/the-langoliers-stephen-king)\" before I ran completely out of steam. I dropped what I had without revision, to this day. Perhaps one day I shall return...\n\n> In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn.  \n\nThese two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed novel, [*Blimp's Burden*](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/pith), and are almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simply wouldn't allow them to go forgotten, so I [published the chapter as an excerpt on *The Psalms*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but give it your attention and you'll be amused, I think. \n\n![The Psalms Stats by Post - 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W3crmS2L.png)\n\n## Summer\n\nThe general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content popularity seems to be something like *you never know what's going to blow up*. I experienced this phenomena quite severely for the first time in my writing life after posting \"[Google Is Not God of The Web](https:\/\/bilge.world\/google-page-experience)\" on [HackerNews](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=23383548) right before going out-of-touch for some 13 straight hours amidst a local BLM protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I expect anything to come of sharing it, there - I only did so simply because the thought crossed my mind. Honestly, it is probably the least-considered content I'd ever published on *The Psalms* - I only put it up when I did because I knew *all* of my energy was about to be absorbed for an entire weekend or more. I only started the thing because I felt it important to raise a small voice in reminder that tech media had started using language when discussing code\/online development which had begun to assume the existence of a single, objective standard of measure for *good web design*. (Fuck your bootstrap baloney, [*The Drywall Website*](https:\/\/iowa.neocities.org\/test) was a *real* *paradigm shit*.)\n\nAnd yet... That single goddamned post would end up accruing more pageviews than all of my writing on the web, combined (I suspect.) Tens of thousands of words were written in hundreds of comments, which I did my best to parse in [a *for the hell of it* substack email](https:\/\/davidblue.substack.com\/p\/witness-google-god-and-local-history):\n\n> Out of everything I’ve shared on *Bilge* recently, it’s hilarious that this particular post - on which I spent a cumulative total of perhaps 25 minutes writing and made less effort than ever to edit - became probably my most widely-shared work of all time.  \n\nOnce again, I *am* thankful for the readership and correspondence, I just *really fucking wish* it had been on literally *anything* else I've written about technology.\n\nIn retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another vague promise to *re-imagine email* in the days surrounding [the launch of Basecamp's HEY](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/6\/15\/21286466\/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch), but I feel it's important to nurture what paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future, so I decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested visitors to write in with their own thoughts on email. I spent a morning clacking out \"[Email and I: An Abridged History](https:\/\/bilge.world\/hey-email-history),\" which I hope will one day serve as a part-foundation for a thorough, composed extension to my [*Why I Write About Technology*](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e) series. This would be *The Psalms* last relevant work for a few months, while I played around with [an experimental WordPress website](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/wordpress-experimentation\/) and dove into [*fuckin' school*](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/college-return\/) for the first time in seven years.\n\n![WTF](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/cwm5gKqi.png)\n\n## Fall\n\nI returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd discovered: \"[Indulging Once More in Digital Excess](https:\/\/bilge.world\/digital-excess).\" After exploring the concept of [*Digital Gardens*](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/blogchains\/digital-gardens\/), buying [my first pro-ready desktop PC](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/hp-envy-desktop\/) in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe software for the first time, and reading [a delightful book](https:\/\/www.hup.harvard.edu\/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076) documenting the history of word processing, I arrived upon the term *Software Historian* with which to partially describe myself. It doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt be explored imminently on this Web Site.\n\nAddressing \"[The Social Dilemma's Dilemma](https:\/\/bilge.world\/the-social-dilemma)\" and \"[Software Thanksgiving](https:\/\/bilge.world\/big-thank)\" in detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at least note how they represent diametrically opposed perspectives through which to discuss this stuff. Going forward into 2021, I think it's important that I hold short on the progress I've made in moderating my voice since 2018. *Digestibility* is not a virtue I am at all interested in, nor is it an appropriate one in which to invest any more effort. Any non-*radical* argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal, which makes for a huge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all the editorializing I've done.\n\n![Blogging vs.](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/T4Z1w1nI.jpg)\n\n## Three Point Oh\n\nSomewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came across the concept of academic [revision tracking and peer review via Git](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/git-peer-review\/). Having dipped my toe back in academia, any such circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible was naturally intriguing. *Just wait until I show these goons how to use hyperlinks.* Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into the Git-Gone Bender I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actually understand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of nearly 80 repositories on [my new GitHub account](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone). Though I'd created one for each of my web properties ages ago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they were all quickly abandoned. In the past two weeks or so, I think I've actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, best exemplified by [*The Psalms*' Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge) as it stands.\n\nThe \"automated\" [Project Board](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/projects\/1) I set up has so far been a very impressive replacement for the simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their various stages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and actual Publication. Technical \"[Issues](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues)\" regarding the CMS and\/or the Repository, itself, have also fit in these categories well, so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by their number to describe [Commits](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/commits\/main), which form an impressive revision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I also figured out the general idea behind Milestones and set [*The Psalms*' first one](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/milestone\/1) for my 27th birthday, next month. The goal is to have figured this all out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumbling upon entire featuresets multiple times in a workday. [*Thinking in Public*](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/2020\/07\/23\/thinking-in-public\/) - as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say - is what I'm trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are more than welcome to hop the fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you - as it was for me just weeks ago - I would suggest the directory for [In-Progress Drafts](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/Drafts) as a starting point.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">requesting support on how to &quot;leverage discussions&quot; to talk about pee pee and poo poo. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/GitHubUniverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GitHubUniverse<\/a><\/p>&mdash; ※ David Blue ※ (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1336374708753797123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n[GitHub Actions](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/actions) are still more or less a mystery to me, but I am unbothered - *The Psalms*' seems to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for \"GitHub Universe\" a few weeks ago, when dark mode and GitHub Discussions were opened up to more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single application for forums in the context of my blog's repository, but [I turned them on, anyway](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/discussions). It's very possible that all of the documentation-generating functions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but - as I entrust GitHub with the eternal task of archiving such work - it is my hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.\n\n![Caslon Bilge Type Capture](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vMsQQHSG.png)\n\nIf you've found yourself in possession of a .edu email address and are interested in GitHub related experimentation, see [this list of discounted\/free dev programs\/services for students](https:\/\/education.github.com\/pack\/offers), which includes a free subscription to \"GitHub Pro.\" (Apparently, equivalent to a $4\/month service.) Adobe has [similar discounts](https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/creativecloud\/buy\/students.html), as you’re probably already aware, which have allowed me to pursue my goal of learning InDesign. So far, I’ve created a sort of [commemorative 404 page for *The Drynet*](https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/104230341\/Four-Oh-Four) and a [font showcase of Georgia](https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/104229721\/Moms-Georgia-Type-Specimen) for my mother. As much as I’d love to continue discussing the current state of Adobe apps, I’ve realized 1) I am quite distinct from a *professional user*, which is why I genuinely find GIMP more useful than Photoshop, for instance, and 2) given the length of my to-write list considering my current pace, I don’t know if I’d manage to get around to it in this lifetime.\n[[SnapChat 2020 Review Video Embed](https:\/\/youtu.be\/wrhh8zDH-AA)]\nBetween now and the 11th of this month, I will be migrating worthwhile posts from the experimental WordPress site (WTF) here and closing its hosting account. I haven’t been compelled to actually do anything with it in months, and the handy redirects, alone, are not worth the upcosts, however fair. Some content - including the corresponding posts for my Adobe experiments *will not* be imported from WTF here. I’m also going to rely on [the Web Archive](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210204191628\/https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/) for publishing the rest. Notable discoveries so far include “[Through an iPhone 4’s Lens](https:\/\/bilge.world\/iphone4-photography),” which is a reminder of how revolutionary that particular handset was, and a few extra-Psalms pieces of content I’d like you to experience, like [this Notion gallery](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/7f4664a737d1429eb94d33cb3486e9e0?v=aad96df288034d2dbe4dd667d6b7f543) of my single jaunt into drawing, [# DavidBlueDraws](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/davidbluedraws). Best of all is my friend [Tevin’s episode of *Extratone*’s defunct flagship podcast](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone\/episodes\/Esporting-Psycholiterates--Favored-of-Email-en398f\/a-a3vklt8). In the years since, he’s become quite the prolific [Twitch streamer](https:\/\/twitch.tv\/YourBudTevin). (I’ve watched enough and know Tevin well enough to say that he’s particularly entertaining in this medium.)\n [Futureland Episode Embed]\n## Coming Soon\nFor better or worse, all of these new exploratory avenues have so far led directly away from the business of *actually writing*, but - in my best self-estimation - I suspect I’m mostly done with fiddling, now, and ready to start thinking on the page, again. Predictably, I’ve let my upcoming [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) turn into quite a monstrosity over the past two months. It turns out, years of lapsed attention toward iOS development resulted in my feeling more out-of-the-loop than I expected, which I was compelled to remedy, naturally. If you’re so inclined, you can follow the minutia attached to my review process via [this dedicated Snapas gallery](https:\/\/snap.as\/extratone\/iphone-12-pro-max), [this shared iCloud album](https:\/\/bit.ly\/12bbbp), my [personal YouTube channel](http:\/\/bit.ly\/psalmsyt) , and [this Twitter collection](https:\/\/bit.ly\/ip12pmtw).\n[[Long Exposure Tweet Embed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1344555610155712512)]\nAs per my newfound use of GitHub, I’ve played around with various ways of documenting this journey, specifically. First is [this Wiki page](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/wiki\/David-Blue-on-iPhone-&-iOS) (which I shall do my best to remember to keep updated) listing the entirety of my writing history on iPhone and iOS. (It’s uh... A bit underwhelming, if I’m honest.) I’ve also just begun a [dedicated repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/i) for iOS-related documentation and resources, which will soon include a full, sensically-indexed list of iCloud share links to my entire Siri Shortcuts collection (I hope.) Immediately following the review, I intend to publish here a post [dedicated to functions Apple has failed to properly document](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/56), which I expect to be the most widely-useful content on this domain. To see some of the suggestions I’ve received so far and\/or to add your own, see [this mildly-successful thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ios\/comments\/l5p7ly\/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish) I posted in r\/iOS.\nWhen I have finally tired of talking about handsets once more, I hope to return my attention toward some other overwhelmingly-ambitious monstrosities like my [academic paper](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bigblue) proposing federated, open-source social networks in favor of the Big Boys, my [report](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/44) on the experience of returning to academia for a semester in 2020, and my [evaluation of Notion](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/12) as perhaps the next Big Step in the evolution of notetaking software. Perhaps before tackling projects the size of these, I intend to compile another [listicle of handy tips](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/28) for newcomers to Writeas. As I linked before, you can now view the entirety of *The Psalms’* status in as much detail as you’d like via [its Project Board on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/projects\/1). As always, you can delight me by directly engaging on [Twitter](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel), [Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue), [Discord](http:\/\/bit.ly\/holeguest), and\/or via [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com). Let’s hope 2021’s equivalent of this review doesn’t take me until February to publish!\n\n#meta #iP12PM",

I don't we wait I really have a choice at this point OK like anyway the reason I know I think that we bought 16 register it was one night and I hope you haven't cooked around a little bit are I didn't see any new functionality I am but I saw that it's got a subscription frankly I think you had to buy three but each version there's one time fee maybe this is the time that is to say it seems like from what the researcher I'm just on the past 40 minutes but the only reason that we bought six actually made tech news it's because they've decided to go with us? For a nine month notice I think the $.99 on her arm I also never pay that I have been begging I have been all but begging Twitter to the service the social network to come up with the premium subscription service the room is Addison or whatever that idea I've heard of hoped knowing that it was unlikely and Twitter might just consider it like I've been baking up so I don't know I have to write this post because of the only other acknowledgment would just be me scream at everyone and everything myself arm and screaming myself about the volume and screaming are ridiculous it is a considering was about a fucking social media service but I am another thing although apparently investigative I've been asking around that in discord some credits iphone communities like hell they want also are used a Bluetooth keyboard with her iPhone I am only got one response I was no I'm really gonna really respond every other question I am starting to think I might be the only person he's ever done I'm still doing it right now but I am to buy crucially support Keyboard Shortcuts now arm while I was still unconscious of the true repercussions of tweet bad sex as a release it's early release right now yeah I noticed because I got a Apple magic keyboard for my birthday it's like you're my phone I was excited to use it with a new two but I am as I know I found whatever when I open to be bad sex and found that after work to favorite tweets and command or didn't work to reply to that arm bother enough that I a draft an email to type oughts support the gist of that email was hey so I'm probably the only person that uses this functionality of your app so I'm not complaining whatsoever but I was wondering if this was an intentional omission should I expect Keyboard Shortcut sport going forward I am in peoples history they respond I certainly properly and just like a watch workouts aren't working they should all be working and I took long time and I had this idea that we all deal really nice thing for them and I will go and test now this is the list when you go and search for him to buy for I was keyboard shortcuts you're going to get the iPad list and as I've discovered in my Iowa season life this is the same for basically all just that ever support you were short as it's literally like no one considers that they might be using a key with the iPhone arm which is totally reasonable but yeah and so they don't even but like I don't know I don't know how it works but somehow in every case the eyepatch workouts don't always work on iPhone most of the time it's only a few like literally like two or three out of 15 arm of the shortcuts to do work on iPad and give an app actually work on iPhone Sometimes there's like a weird modifier he let us change for no reason I would so I am basically the documentation is just immediately now that it's a time correct so anyway and I don't do a list of chocolates that were working that I remember working into bus five and kennel and can get to work now in the current release of us five so the ones that basically the discrepancy and that's their only 2F and commander all the other shortcuts that I was able to find one of the shortcuts that are listed the ones that are still working I wish oh my God he used to be into it but wanna say command T retweeted or was it just T as work anymore am I getting those things they just go away and Violence playing but like this initial people use your working with the ravens it's just like there's nothing I am and you just expect as if that is the way things are right though I get the chances are able to if you were around apparently iPhone if you didn't it didn't occur to you before I am best for the way that she thinks I need to start OK now I'm going to really decide but he manage taxi home or basically were for the Home the Home button arm and command space Partman sponge OK so I don't think I completed it but actually it takes a lot of time You don't like super old keyboard or flush the switch between us to have a intestine but I got an email and it's like you're this you are working your are some others but I tested there are definitely work that's cool no one will ever hear about the bit about you I wish it was only care a lot about me I want to dump is because again violence playing I have done things like this in our friend particular and that's like taking some time so you know I've done but ours sometimes I am in trying to Well basically just do feedback thoroughly document and feedback arm for functions that I seem to be invested in this is like anyone else cares or noticed I have any other examples right now and will example is I just my first formal use of the feedback assistant Apple iOS downloaded a Bluetooth

only way to fix it is to reboot the phone which is not a big deal but I'd like to think through hopefully a clear feedback post at least think that's a good example that someone actually read it if

twitter epic forgot sex with someone please design new brand assets for both of these absolutely new icon please On Twitter think it had a recent update I remember years ago November 2018 wife out of the terrific was still considered a competitor like I really thought it was just we bought was at the words third-party Twitter client that market was so early I mean the APIs with me just without without them I just was immediately points basically but I told her if it's still going on god if it's terrible to I wish actually research now and find out who is keeping score is a five anyway I am it's crazy I never would've imagined that the people buying Tweetbot and Tweetbot after the AP I was basically neutered and enough Like it I'm not a developer I haven't really but like actually am a registered letter to all but I think maybe a I'll try to leave him from what I understand all the left of the APIs function was basically just enough so that they could use themselves with their own apps for things like the embedded Tweet tool that the website silent mode for TweetDeck when I was a standalone Windows allocation and you can post simultaneously with just the answer key to like 10 different services if y'all stop morning on him I'm gonna try to borrow my moms Mac and as far as another's hasn't been a big thing so we bought three for magCulture I just want again That's satisfying it's like the only like every time I open up the computer it's bear and sweeper I just think geez these are almost enough reason to switch but I was tennis is so infuriating to me I'm sure in the right anyway fuck it is but it's still I should really try to interview them I wondered if they do it honestly I've bought every version Tweetbot since three and I was a thing of her handful of us forever to the lake and honestly OK here yeah she's actually the same and that it matters to people now probably maybe you're actually looking at this age it would be totally irrational considering Tweetbot arm support of Louis and what I said about this and how are used player if you ridiculous of me to not pay that subscription until either quickly or sadly for the rest of my Twitter using life like honestly unfortunately I am I think I just haven't figured out yet they have Twitter app is so much better at search I just Respond with MedSurg my outfit I am I never considered that I would ever have an opportunity to replace it again until a few hours so a lot of configuration to do maybe I don't know I am I am pet huge fan on because nobody has my truck anyway anymore I am turning out a way that is that it is at all urgent but do you realize with a keyboard or useless navigation feature I just discovered into it I just barely been around for her that you can actually command one the timeline you can switch that out for one of your list and just have your list that list literally replace your time on me the last less user the ultimate defender the ultimate town I would say the fender actually just desperate less user ever a another cause I didn't used to actually look like reading that I can Tatian but I happen to fuck actually look at things now which takes a lot of time I am yeah I'm I can't say that I I am actually excited in the use of the word that really matters like the one when your kids were excited for something I'm curious I guess the link that the regret that I didn't find that out before him that I didn't know that all people my anger was all of ours excited but anyway I'm looking forward to it's almost like they built differently the last few topic vision not your topic because the actual content is but Twitter will just be literally I want to like you know move to three menus to find my friends list anymore Toto will literally just be my friends or my car list how is that not worth a dollar a month those are less users I don't I guess I should it's important I wanna do this post like actually on Spotify so now trying to convert to

I noticed many of the reviews here criticized it for its lack of innovation, which is absolutely apt. *however*, I have personally come to realize lately that it’s important to allow myself to enjoy things even if they don’t have some quantifiable value. it was difficult not to turn off this film at a few points, but I’m glad I didn’t. there is real substance.\nhttps:\/\/boxd.it\/1xeERn\n\n#anecdote",

We know this, already, but specifically regarding **bylines**… From what I have observed in the wild, the majority of casual news consumers rarely if ever notice them. As far as they're concerned, anything they happen to read on the new york times dot com, or from their various social accounts, is most definitely written in the voice of *the brand*.\n\nObviously, much has been said on this issue by meta media authorities here and elsewhere, but the disconnect remains glaring and alarming from where I sit. \n\nI vaguely remember a conversation I had with a partner on this subject when I was attempting to build a unique digital media company circa 2017: We were tossing very *technical*, UX-ey design solutions around. As in the CSS style of the byline element on an article's webpage… We dropped it, but I think it's worth thinking about **visually reengineering our methodologies of attribution**.  \n#engagement",

    "content" : "# Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts Support on iPhone (Request)\nHello! \nI just want to first apologize for the length and specificity of this request, but I’ve been putting it off for almost 10 years now, for what it’s worth haha. I am looking for something quite specific: ~formal documentation (from Apple!) of bluetooth hardware keyboard shortcuts **on iPhone** - especially within the native apps.~\n\nIt’s quite easy to find these for shortcuts supported **on iPad** (here’s an easy example: https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT211096.) A lot of times, the iPad shortcut guide will even specifically mention that *some* of them are also supported on iPhone, but not *all*, but *they never specify beyond that.”* I understand that extended hardware keyboard use with iPhone is a very fringe case, but - from what I know about Apple’s principles of software development\/design - I am quite sure this\/these list(s) specifying which keyboard shortcuts native iOS apps support on iPhone are properly documented, *somewhere*. If they aren’t, I would strongly suggest Apple take a second to do so - surely the most valuable company in history has the resources, no?\n\n## Device Inforamation\n#### My iPhone\n- Model Name: iPhone 12 Pro Max\n- Model Number: MG953LL\/A | A2342\n- Model: D54pAP\n- Serial Number: G0PDQ6CZ0D46\n#### My Keyboard\nProduct Name as listed in the invoice: “MAGIC KEYBOARD WITH NUM KEYPAD SG-USA\nMRMH2LL\/A”\n\n\n#documentation #keys",

Yes, the 12 Pro Max is *bigger*- and definitely prompts a conversation on how big we’re actually going to let smartphones get before we... idk.. call them something else(?) - but it’s far from *alarmingly huge* or anything, as  [Nilay Patel’s review](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21555901\/iphone-12-pro-max-review)  seems to suggest. It’s very possible that I say this out of Big Hand Privilege, though - auto journalist Matt Farrah (whom I trust completely) noted that he chose the 12 Mini because he can use it one-handed. It occurred to me, hearing this, that my own usership hasn’t really ever included this aspect. Nilay felt so strongly about the 12 Pro Max’s size that he recommends you find a way to experience its size in person before ordering one. My concern - as much as I love the idea of the 12 Mini - centers around the fact that I am already starting to struggle with the diminishing size of the buttons in the UX of popular apps like [TikTok](https:\/\/vm.tiktok.com\/ZMe17ocYh\/), and I’d rather not make my eyes struggle with text size any more than absolutely necessary. Handily enough, one can now access iOS’ text-enlarging slider from within the Control Center. \n\nFor myself and others, the flat sides of the design prompt a reflection on how this may be the first genuinely beautiful iPhone since the iPhone 4.\n\n- - - -\n- [ ] Jeez I hadn’t considered covering the whole industry of super-custom iPhone mods that exist.\n[Caviar pays tribute to the Apple I with a custom iPhone 12](https:\/\/www.gsmarena.com\/caviar_pays_tribute_to_the_apple_i_the_original_handbuilt_computer_with_a_custom_iphone_12-news-45522.php) | *GSMArena*\n[Diamond-encrusted $129,000 iPhone features nativity scene made of gold](https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/gold-diamond-iphone-nativity-scene\/) | *Mashable*\n\n#iP12PM",

She asked what Beykpour had been working on since leaving Blackboard, an education company that had acquired his prior startup, TerriblyClever. Beykpour fired up his iPhone and showed her [Periscope](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/about).\n\nPeriscope, he told her, was like a mobile teleportation service. It let users livestream whatever was happening around them for anyone who wanted to watch. Instead of Youtube, where a viewing experience was passive, Periscope was active. Viewers could comment, ask questions, and heart broadcasts in real time.\n\nBeykpour and his co-founder Joe Bernstein came up with the idea for Periscope while traveling abroad in 2013. Beykpour was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He wanted to see what was happening there, so he turned to Twitter. While he could read about the protests, he couldn't *see* them.\n\n\"It just occurred to me, there were so many smart phones out there, why wasn't there a way for me to ask who else was out there what was happening there?\" Beykpour explains.\n\nPeriscope was founded in February 2014. Beykpour and Bernstein raised a seed round from angel investors, including Adobe executive Scott Belsky.\n\n\"When I first met Kayvon and Joe I was struck by their desire to spread truth and empathy by enabling anyone to experience the world through someone else’s eyes,\" Belsky wrote to Business Insider in an email. \"We joked that Periscope was akin to teleportation, a technology and user experience that lets you be anywhere and witness anything. This became a lot more serious when I witnessed a major fire in San Francisco, a child’s first steps, and a man’s cancer treatment.\"\n\nVerrilli was impressed with Periscope and offered to introduce Beykpour to some big-wigs at Twitter, including CEO Dick Costolo and co-founder Jack Dorsey.\n\nBefore long, Twitter offered to buy Periscope. And it doesn't sound like Twitter was the only interested party.\n\n(\"I can't comment specifically on that but it was an incredibly fortunate situation,\" Beykpour says.)\n\nThe acquisition interest in Periscope felt gratifying for the entrepreneurs. \"[You feel] a mix of things,\" Beykpour says. \"It can be hard and terrifying to build a startup and anytime there's a minute where someone steps aside to validate you — whether it's friends, parents or an acquirer, it's a moment that feels really awesome.\"\n\nAfter seeking a lot of advice from people both inside Twitter and out, Beykpour and Bernstein determined an acquisition was the best way to ensure their product would succeed. Twitter and Beykpour won't reveal the exact acquisition amount, but an industry sources tell Business Insider the deal was somewhere between $75 and $120 million. The [deal closed in January](http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3).\n\n\"They paid us all in hashtags,\" Beykpour jokes.\n\nStartup stories like Periscope's make entrepreneurship sound easy. Just put in 11 months of work and flip your app for ~ $120 million, no traction or launch needed.\n\n\"I can tell you it's not easy,\" Beykpour says. \"A year might not sound like a lot of time, but ::it's our baby:: quite literally and we've been living and breathing it.\"\n\nHe adds, \"Acquisitions are really hard personal and team decisions to make. Thinking about it objectively though, it’s total first-world problems making a choice like that.\"\n\n> It’s total first-world problems making a choice like that.  \n\nHere's everything you need to know about Periscope, Twitter's new prized possession, and what Twitter plans to do with it.\n\n## **What is Periscope?**\n\nPeriscope is a mobile app that lets users broadcast live to others. The viewers can comment, ask questions, and send hearts to the broadcaster in real time. Periscope users create usernames and follow each other, just like they do on Twitter. It's a lot like Meerkat and YouNow, two livestreaming competitors.\n\nHere's early Uber investor Chris Sacca asking Periscope users how he should break the news to his kids that their pet fish is probably dying. People watching offered him lots of support by way of comments.   Business Insider\n\n### **What are Periscope's key features?**\n\nSome of Periscope's best features are hearts and notifications. Hearts can be sent from viewers to broadcasters as a show of appreciation for what's being streamed, like a virtual round of applause.\n\nAnd we're not just talking one heart. A 3-minute broadcast can yield hundreds of hearts from just a few viewers (Beykpour sent more than 40 hearts during one of my broadcasts).\n\nPush notifications are also well executed on Periscope. You'll receive one anytime someone you follow starts a livestream, or anytime someone you follow recommends a livestream so you can tune in.\n\nPeriscope has a strong notification system that's almost a little too much. Periscope sends you notifications anytime a person you follow is broadcasting live, or anytime someone you follow recommends another person's live broadcast to all their followers.   Business Insider    \n  \n\n### **How Periscope works:**\n\nWhen you open the app, you'll see three icons at the bottom: a TV, a camera, and a group of people. The group of people takes you to a screen where you can see other Periscopers and choose to follow them.\n\nHere, you can see a bunch of Periscope beta testers, including TechCrunch Editor in Chief Alexia Tsotsis and Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nIf you click on the camera icon, you'll be able to start a broadcast. Just type in what you're seeing to name the broadcast (for example, I made one titled: \"Tour Business Insider, where scoops break and snacks are eaten.\")\n\nThen you can either hit the lock button and invite select friends to watch or share the link to your Twitter followers who can tune in on their desktops. You can also broadcast to everyone on Periscope. It's pretty nerve-wrecking!\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nThat's pretty much it. There are a few extra bells and whistles, but the experience is easy to grasp. The hardest thing about Periscope is figuring out what to say and stream.\n\n## **What's Twitter's plan for Periscope?**\n\nTwitter is letting Periscope continue to operate independently, with its own team, brand and headquarters. Both Periscope and Twitter want the same thing: to be the pulse of what's happening around the world in real time.\n\nBelsky believes Periscope will be a \"huge part\" of Twitter's future.\n\n\"The concept of what I call 'live mobile immersion' will enable people to eye-witness news as it happens, see sporting events from the sidelines, see behind the scenes of anything official...its huge,\" he says.\n\nChris Sacca is a renowned tech investor whose early investments in Twitter and Uber made him a billionaire. He isn't invested in Periscope, but he has been using the app in closed beta. He agrees with Belsky — the app is bound to shape Twitter's future.\n\n\"When I first saw Periscope, I loved how immediate and intimate it was,\" he tells Business Insider in an email. \"There is no longer any distance between me and the people I am watching...Twitter owns real-time and there is nothing more real-time and engaging than live video. This is the future of Twitter.\"\n\n[What it's like to sell your startup for ~$120 million before it's even launched: Meet Twitter's new prized possession, Periscope](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3) #archive",

href='Apple,%20Inc.%20as%20an%20%E2%80%9CEntertainment%20Company%E2%80%9D.mp3'>Apple, Inc. as an “Entertainment Company”.mp3<\/a>\n## Transcript\nAt some point it was decided I don't know if it was them or us or both it was decided at some point that Apple Inc. up is was is a lifestyle company I am I can look that up I'm sitting here and in front of me is my surface laptop to you on it posit 10 minutes 52 seconds and is the Billie Eilish movie Billie Eilish the worlds a little more blurry on Apple TV+ arm and it's not is it it is important to talk about this in a fucking phone review why well I am because when you buy the phone you a year of Apple TV+ free which is same reason why in this fucking fun of you we also had to talk about Apple Arcade And whatever it was for the term Kim about lifestyle company I am it's it's an interesting dynamic because I am just thinking I don't know who I am I don't know what level to put on myself because I have both been a air zealous I've been a salad for him and also my original take videos I just acknowledge myself as an apple or just so strange because that was such a refund of the time and I've never acknowledged and seen the word Apple nerd with all the stuff considering that it's designed specifically not to be nerdy is that an interesting dynamic as it's as funny as how the word iPhone or the term iPhone power user is gone from being an oxymoron to a well still funny but I think that exist Not even necessarily a rare thing but anyway I am I guess if I was doing it if I was making a computer company if I was making hardware I wouldn't want any part of us and I think that one of the reasons why we don't have fanboys so much anymore in the Apple versus no Apple thing is because we have realize that it's like comparing apples to oranges ha ha Ha all of them I will just is unique still in not just the truth of what they are the business by and what they want to be basically I'm just St. Luke's I don't think that Samsung wants to be a lifestyle company I am and I think of it maybe the rest of the industry that's it still looks at Apple and I just kind a like well that's fucking weird I am anyway Reviewing the purpose of reviewing the whole thing as an experience I guess literally for the future and look back on I would say that I have not been I've not been interesting experience in the clinical lifestyle out I haven't been living it on since all those early iPhone years I am and I did for a while I have a 2008 MacBook as my PC is my computer I am that was once but most of the time most of my life I've had a Windows PC and an Apple headset and I want someone buy that are under the simple justification of all of your phone you don't wanna take it like you have your phone be a Tinkertown what you W really yeah is a air but your computer right now you do you want your bill to be open and capable of doing whatever so I ran and grab your phone you need to be solid and elegant and I have a teaser experience for you robust thoughtful and reserved I am but none of that applies to leave or are you just I guess what I'm trying to do here is figure out how much of that all stigma is true and what it means going forward for consumer technology a and brand look like with the brand name anyway I am I think though and I think we can agree looking at the Apple TV thing arm because lifestyle company is one thing becoming an entertainment company media company is one thing I think I am Apple is a media company a in a very particular way of it again no one is trying to compete with them because the app stories and man in their own little environments a Apple news But I think they've they figured out their place as life as a computer company as a lifestyle company and as a little in a small way to meet a company but this thing as an entertainment company though I think we've all been like I think you're over stretching yourself I don't think you can I don't think you're ready for this I don't think that it's what you need to be doing granted there's so huge that they're really reach that point where they might they just keeps going with Olivia well we might as well try anything but I am that's also really privileged position anyway a I don't think it's gonna work the other Tameka thing arm which isn't all that important to but looking at all Like, this like the Apple TV application the software on my mom's Samsung smart TV compared to the rest of the apps Native and third-party is so much better it's so much nicer looking and solid and smooth and it's it's much faster and it's perfect except except for the content him and I just of saying all this because I think here is an instance where Apple needs to be a computer company again a need to go back to being with computer company the software company And acknowledge what we don't know the first thing about making movies but damn we can go back and just make the softer use to stream as babies and because the what I would love is if I don't need what's on Apple TV at all there's nothing there basically but I'd love it if the platform arm was what actually underpin all the other streaming services but I have so I guess it's my comment was just apples in there and same company this is some dynamic there I just don't think it's gonna work and I'm sorry Tim him but I really don't think you believe that you're gonna lose you're not missing anything Apple Inc. hilarious that I'm talking about this\n- - - -\n## Apple vs. Google\n> This has been the tension forever: can Google figure out hardware before Apple figures out services?  \n-David Pierce on *The Vergecast*, [October 24, 2014](https:\/\/pca.st\/episode\/87067910-3dad-0132-c588-5f4c86fd3263)\n\nHilariously, 7 years later, I think the truth is that neither has really figured their respective new avenues. Stadia sounds like one hell of a deal - especially for someone like me, who’s main computers have basically zero GPU performance - but 20 minutes in to my first F1 practice session, all of the sudden, reality broke down, inputs lagged into like 10 second latency, and I fucking crashed.\n\nApple TV+ is an excitingly beautiful experience in every way except content. (Which is debatably the most important aspect of streaming services?? I’m not sure if I’ve yet figured out which is most important to me, personally.)",

    "content" : "# Walt Mossberg 1st Generation iPhone Review Transcript\nHi this is what Maasberg personal technology columnist from the Wall Street Journal and this is the week for months people have been going crazy about this forthcoming device called the iPhone from Apple.\r\nHere it is it goes on sale Friday at 6:00 PM.\r\nAnd in the 16 years I have been reviewing tech products, I cannot remember any product having this kind of hype and high expectations surrounding it.\r\nSo it was quite interesting for me to be testing it the last two weeks I conducted my tests in a number of cities on both.\r\nAt East and West coasts I used it in airports and Starbucks and my house and office and Fenway Park in Boston on streets and.\r\n::It is certainly the most beautiful and the most radical smartphone or handheld computer I have ever tested.::\r\nStarting with the physical you can see it's very thin.\r\nIt's actually thinner than, for instance, the Samsung Blackjack, which is quite a skinny phone.\r\nAnd yet it has this enormous 3 1\/2 inch screen which takes up most of the front of it.\r\nIt does not have a keyboard, it uses a virtual keyboard on the screen and when this was first announced by Apple in January, when the phone was disclosed, I was among many, many people who thought this was a real dealbreaker feature.\r\nI have to say that.\r\nThree days into testing the thing I wanted to throw it out the window because the keyboard was so difficult to use and I was so slow and making so many errors on it, but.\r\nFive days in I suddenly found that I could type as well as fast as I have been typing on my trio's physical keyboard for years, so my conclusion is that the keyboard issue on the iPhone is a non issue.\r\nThe phone has a tremendous web browser.\r\nThe best I have ever seen on a handheld device.\r\nIt actually shows you the real layout and the real totality of the web pages you're looking at.\r\nIt doesn't rearrange them or stack them or do all the funny things that you're used to on a phone.\r\nAnd if you want to zoom in and read a section of a web page, you just double tap with your finger.\r\nThe email program on it is also very PC or computer like it shows you a preview of the email and if, let's say there's a photo that's been sent in the email that photo you don't have to click separately to see it.\r\nIt shows up right there in the email.\r\nThe phone part of it is fine.\r\nI wouldn't say it was the best voice quality I've ever heard on a phone, but it was OK.\r\nThe big drawback to the iPhone, in my opinion, is the fact that it only runs on one carrier in the United States, and that's AT&T. Apple, an AT&T, did an exclusive deal. It is not a short term exclusive deal either. I do not expect anytime in the foreseeable future.\r\nTo see this phone in a version from Verizon or Sprint or T-Mobile. And in fact it's locked so that you you can't even put in a T-Mobile card an use it on the T-Mobile Net.\r\nWork now AT&T is the biggest carrier in the US, So why do I consider that a downside? Well, we all know that a coverage batteries, and if you're in an area without a great AT&T coverage, no matter how much you lust after this thing, it's not going to be very useful. If you can't make calls on it. The other problem is.\r\nThat's the data part of this, and remember I said it has a wonderful email program and a wonderful web browser, but those depend, of course on a fast connection to the Internet.\r\nAnd this phone runs on a cell network that AT&T has that's called Edge, which is quite slow compared to the faster networks that even AT&T has on some other phones, and that Verizon and Sprint have on some treos and Blackberries and other competitors. So if you are relying on the cell phone network.\r\nFor Internet access on this, it is fairly slow.\r\nThe saving grace is.\r\nthe iPhone also has Wi-Fi.\r\nThere are a few other smartphones with that, but not many.\r\nAnd Apple has designed the Wi-Fi part of this beautifully, so that when you walk into a room or a Starbucks or someplace where there's a Wi-Fi network, the phone knows about, it instantly switches you.\r\nTo Wi-Fi for your Internet access and of course.\r\nThat really flies, but when you're on the move, if you're in a cab, going through a city and you're trying to do web browsing or email, you're pretty much stuck with the slower cell phone network called Edge. Well, there's a lot more to say about this, and I've covered a lot more of the details in my column in the Wall Street Journal an on wsj.com, and on.\r\nAll things did come, but this is a fascinating product that I think raises the bar for all other smartphones.\r\nThis is Walt Mossberg, an I'll see you next week.\n\n#transcription",

    "content" : "Kansas City to Rock Springs, Wyoming\n> Hawthorn and I were on what was supposed to be the last leg of our cross-country roadtrip to Portland, blasting up the vast, otherworldly Interstate 80, about 90 minutes East of the Utah border. It was late afternoon and we were both beginning to get hungry, so we decided to stop in Rock Springs, which the roadside signage had been emphasizing for a significant distance. Despite its miserly population of less than 25,000, the area is the fourth most populated municipality in the state. (Incredibly, Cheyenne - capitol and most populate of Wyoming - has only 62,845 occupants as of 2014.)> I spied and set course for Exit 104, but hit some kind of massive, traumatic fissure in the asphalt with my XJR’s right-front tire (this will become important information momentarily.) The sort of impact that makes you yell, but doesn’t quite worry you about a puncture or damaged suspension, though perhaps it should have worried me, considering that I’d already destroyed two tires and a wheel in a particularly-harrowing pothole strike in July, back in rural Missouri. Regardless, the twenty-year-old, massively overladen Executive Saloon had already endured so much more than I would’ve expected from it in the past four days of the trip - including the moderately treacherous Loveland Pass near Keystone, CO - that my confidence in its invulnerability had been significantly bolstered.  \n...from *[Words of David Blue in Red](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/words\/inred\/rocksprings\/)*.\n\n![](Kansas%20City%20to%20Rock%20Springs,%20Wyoming\/973e603548ffa021a6ce51ae427486bf.jpeg)\n\n* \n\n![](Kansas%20City%20to%20Rock%20Springs,%20Wyoming\/55357ce8521952ec9e0d879205c2d067.jpeg)\n\n![](Kansas%20City%20to%20Rock%20Springs,%20Wyoming\/157f7e843b6ce9ed723d5b7e7436b866.jpeg)\n\n![](Kansas%20City%20to%20Rock%20Springs,%20Wyoming\/b6a93aa6a55f722c1830e9fb7a4aab07.jpeg)\n\n![](Kansas%20City%20to%20Rock%20Springs,%20Wyoming\/bf8243fd8bdaba318d8e584751d9a963.jpeg)\n\n![](Kansas%20City%20to%20Rock%20Springs,%20Wyoming\/d166e6a3c2369170fa5b7131494aae3e.jpeg)\n\n![](Kansas%20City%20to%20Rock%20Springs,%20Wyoming\/a43ddc195bb2bcb3906f21652bab86b8.jpeg)\n",

Quite simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white balance, warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes, but an interesting contrast to show off is no longer inherently justified in being called a “feature” in Apple products, anymore. Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from [Jon Rettinger](https:\/\/youtu.be\/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s),) you *should not* buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but — if anything — to say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and the tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually every day for my entire adult life. I’d originally decided to abandon this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances, but Apple and its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their [battery scandal](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/iphone-battery-and-performance\/), and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included some experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making it (and myself) totally irrelevant forever.\n\nAs the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry’s state at any given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a product once occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in fact, [never been so](http:\/\/theweek.com\/articles\/459748\/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007). As Nilay Patel [noted](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/9\/19\/16323570\/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017), one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of “basically four years” of the same design. Since launch, it’s unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks — not that I’ve ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what it means to *package* a product, given where their greasy startups all eventually ended up. ( **You cannot doubt me**  — I once took a year-long sabbatical from iOS with a [Sony Xperia Play](https:\/\/youtu.be\/nSWgS0l0kc8), and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to decide whether or not to pay $200 more for “ [the phone of the future](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945),” which knows when you’re watching it, and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge.\n\nSo far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best handset of all time — one hell of an Email Machine that lasted me close to five years — throughout the last two with actual motherboard exposed to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said, who knows how it’d feel to be coerced into using “iPhone OS 2” as it was called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing home an 8 Plus, I [vowed](http:\/\/bit.ly\/drycast47) that my 6S Plus would be my last ever Apple device, but this one *actually* feels like a last hurrah. Though the ability to *Tweet directly from the swipe-down notification menu* is still nowhere to be found (it’s been gone for 5 releases, now, and would seem to have been forgotten by *literally* everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple’s efforts to add to the iPhone 8 and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few debts.\n\nIn part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul — including Mail, which was startling, considering that I’d been looking at what was near as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As a result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I have been left without a clue as to what *a good one* looks like. (Apparently it was [really bad](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article\/342889\/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps)?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have, end-all replacement. [Edison Mail](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/email-edison-mail\/id922793622?mt=8) is currently the smoother, faster, most modular option — at least for another few minutes– but I’ll never know it as I know Mail, and I’ll never want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is too scary. What if I decide once again to kill that massive number in the red badge and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my iPhone 4’s 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours — how am I supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup with such an important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you know.\n\n### Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on iOS?\n\nOne might interpret the App Store’s redesign as an attempt by Apple to control this conversation — of both the trending *new thing* and the old“essentials” that you’ve probably had tucked away in an untouched folder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those gorgeously-presented daily bits has made them a publishing company, though I’m not so sure I’m not the last remaining user who’s continued semi-regularly visiting their “Today” section. If I *did* want to actually read about apps (I don’t — who does?) it wouldn’t make much sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the platform itself, regardless of how much better it may look than all of the tech news sites, paywall or no.\n\nNative screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice, but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the top of the render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here are two sloppy test clips —  [at the zoo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/VnfkWkotGFw), and [fishing](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KOs5m6ynKAI).)\n\nPerhaps some have figured out the new Files “app,” but it’s sat on my homescreen for months, untapped, and it will likely remain there for all time as a sort of soothing trophy — a thanks for my legacy iPhone loyalty. My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and tolling? **I can now view some of the files on my Mobile Computing Device**, and even *scan documents in*, which is mostly novel (though it is fun to digitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I must’ve mischecked a permanent option because all file types now open only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless.\n\n![](The%20Precarious%20Legacy%20of%20the%20iPhone%208%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Psalms\/fuMs1a4.jpg)\nSomehow, I’ve managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero iOS-using folks. All of my friends and colleagues use Android devices (including [Tim’s supercool Nextbit Robin](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/extratonemagazine\/nextbit),) which provide a few handy datapoints (like the camera in [my fiance’s Galaxy S8](https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/BXruaL),) but deprive me of any significant experience with the ostensibly intoxicating cult of iMessage. I’m constantly listening to and reading tech writers claim that it’s [one of the only reasons they’re still using iPhones](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/10\/10\/13225514\/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage-addiction), but my own food-OS loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the [gluttonous](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/audio\/futureland\/toomanymessengers\/) palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram, [now Telegram X](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/telegram-x), WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, *Tinder?*, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… *well, none of this will do*!\n\nHonestly — even if I’d actually been at all informed in my haste, the photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus, alone would’ve sold it. It’s not the new filters, gif functionality, or even “3D Photos” — it’s those mythical dual 12MP sensors (which it shares with something called the iPhone X.) They’re no less than infallible. After four months of [astonishing captures](http:\/\/bit.ly\/ip8plus) in all manner of conditions, I don’t even care how exactly they do it anymore — it’s better to be left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone, Colorado in the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night — the amount of light they were able to find — “up to 80% more,” [according to Apple](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-events\/september-2017\/)  — is just *impossible*.\n\n*The vast majority of the samples in my iPhone 8 Flickr Album were taken within the native Camera app as it ships and left unedited. (Especially before just a few weeks ago, when I [discovered Halide](https:\/\/extratone.com\/race-day-at-hodges).*\n\n![](The%20Precarious%20Legacy%20of%20the%20iPhone%208%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Psalms\/C2LLJAl5.jpg)\nHere is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has never wavered far since its fourth generation [set the standard](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/words\/inred\/iphone4\/), but it’s one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart from its “disable all alarms” feature and its ability to sound itself off in response when you’re hysterically screaming and digging for it through the vast plush of a forty-year-old Lincoln. The customizable Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two [aren’t quite hard switches](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11\/),) though it should’ve come years ago. Notifications are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they were on Android Gingerbread, but I’ve heard things’ve changed quite a bit since then.\n\nI *have* been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times, but it just [wouldn’t make sense](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/words\/inred\/mono\/) from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereo capability should refute those who can’t or won’t understand. Yes, it would be nice if Apple hadn’t led the industry to quite such a compromising obsession with thinness — we’d all trade *a lot* of substance for exponentially greater battery life, storage capacity, water resistance, etc. — but I don’t see much sense in expending your energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley.\n\n> I’ll be here long after you’ve died, and you know why? Because I took the time to sync my apps.  \n\nTwo years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those services have expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I’ve stopped counting chips. Refinement of the hardware design is reverent to the extreme. It’s pretentious, but Apple’s decision to pause on the 8 to consider details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little bit of weight *back in* for ergonomics’ sake leads one to regard it as a monument to all the devices along the development timeline that have led to this… last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not [sold so many](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2018\/02\/apple-reports-first-quarter-results\/).\n\nOne could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in the way of the user completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the vast majority of these for myself — and I am, surely, a “power user.” iOS has changed a lot in the decade I’ve employed it — in far too many ways for the worse — but this pair of handset and software have reached *my* imagination’s limit for what I could possibly want to do. Augmented reality and wireless charging won’t ever have a place in my future, for better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is the ultimate expression of the first and fourth generation’s foundation.\n\nIf the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I’m afraid the 8 Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it’s an early one is for you to decide. This *really is* my last iPhone.\n\n[The Precarious Legacy of the iPhone 8 — The Psalms](http:\/\/bilge.world\/iphone-8-plus-review)\n#iP12PM #i",

I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.  \nConsider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER…” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. Would you have made out on your first date with someone in your 80s high school Chemistry class after they’d was about but suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. “The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”\n\n* Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their regularity. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re trying to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or both.\n* This issue is not unique to American society nor to men, really, but is entirely the sickness of white boomers and gen Xers.

Patapoff began his entrepreneurial endeavors developing a project called Unjailme, an app to alert friends that someone had been arrested and needed to be let out of the slammer.\n\nNot the money-maker either founder was hoping for, the two launched Audiour, the first iteration of Clyp. So far, the pair of developers have seen the site hit more than 2 million page views for the web version of their service, and users have uploaded 220,000 “clyps”.\n\n“We are at uShip right now and we’re [trying to raise this seed round](https:\/\/angel.co\/clyp) so that we can work on Clyp full time,” says Ferguson.\n\n“We limit by file size instead of time,” says Patapoff. “You can upload up to a 100 megabit file.” For a highly compressed mp3 file, users could upload an hour and a half.\n\nHardcore users have come from electronic music producers. Rather than download full sets or songs to a service like SoundCloud, producers are uploading their beats, according to Patapoff. Everyone can upload a file to the site, and it’s caught on as a tool to share anything from music, to lectures, to sermons, and even spoken word poetry.\n\nThe service is ridiculously easy to use. Simply drag and drop an audio file and it’s uploaded to Clyp. The company’s site contains sections for popular sound files, recently uploaded files, and featured files.\n\nAlthough the service is still in its infancy, it’s managed to attract [some high profile users](https:\/\/clyp.it\/lsl3kx4d). You might not recognize the riff, but it’s Eric Clapton who’s playing the notes.\n\n“We’re working on the next generation of our native apps,” says Patapoff. “We want to try experimenting on Clyp… like having embedded audio content and optionally upload an image with your Clyp.”\n\nThe two are also planning to launch paid content and improve the search capabilities, which are now limited to hashtags.\n\nClyp’s [one of several startups](http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2014\/09\/20\/pass-the-word-the-phone-call-is-back\/) looking to give communications its voice back. Companies like [Cord](http:\/\/cordproject.co\/), a voice messaging service, or the walkie-talkie service  [Voxer](http:\/\/www.voxer.com\/), and even giants like Apple are bringing new voice services to market. Then there’s Sobo, the [Giant Pixel](http:\/\/thegiantpixel.com\/portfolio) portfolio company, which, like Clyp, wants to create a social sound board for sharing audio.\n\n[Clyp Wants To Be An Imgur For Sound – TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/02\/06\/clyp-wants-to-be-an-imgur-for-sound\/) #archive",

I suppose it was a bit silly of me to download the [public beta](http:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-to-download-ios-10-public-beta) so late in the game, but I did, and regret it *much* less than I could've imagined.\n\nI've used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal device I've ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life, I've had no persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big deal for reasons you couldn't care less about.\n\nOwnership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time Stevie took the stage. For relevance's sake, I decided to opt in a bit early, despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its first signs of struggle as a result.\n\nImmediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable. Everything is faster: notifications, app opening\/closing, intra-app function, and *text entry,* even. Smoother, too – so much so, it's almost a shame we've had to use iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of such smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when reading the rest of my opining.\n\n**Raise to wake** is less tedious\/more useful than I anticipated, though it's been briefly mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my Moshi Overture Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but it should be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With relatively default sleep\/wake settings, I did not notice enough mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences.\n\n**Messages** is appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes sense. The pressure to “compete” with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, What'sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their reply is not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to SMS. Its role is purely functional. I wasn't able to try out many of the new features. Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but because – critically – I could not think of someone I'd be willing to bother with useless garbage like... a doodle. And even if I could've, it's probably actually *less* trouble to use one of those third-party applications in that Application Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like me, even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are *still buttons*. It feels an awful lot like an obligatory alteration, not a visionary one, and it's a shame that Apple's losing its awareness of the appropriate time for one, the other, or neither.\n\nI feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent upon the ability to differentiate between the allure of an intelligently blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently functional one. Crude, I know, but ever more essential. **Contextual predictions** are impressive and surprisingly-clever. It's encouraging to see progress in such simple interactions, but – be honest with yourself – making use of it is actually going to cost you time in the majority of cases. Hate to be excessively meta here, but keep in mind – again – that I am not the majority. I tend to type things out... It's my thing. If this is completely obscuring my vision of any of these features' uselessness, *please* take the time to add to the discussion in the comments. Discourse is the handiest security in such matters.\n\nI've loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of the time, I've been triggering it unintentionally. It's *very* useful for quickly grabbing web images, but I'm probably more of a thief than you'll ever be. Mostly, I just like the sensation. The curt vibration and brittle illusion of a third interactive dimension have provided more functionality than... its actual functionality. With **touch and go**, though, I can instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local weather conditions, *and* a singular story from Apple News. Though I'm undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious effort to remember to use them, anything's a plus when one's affection was already so irrational.\n\nAs to **Apple News** itself... It's just not the same application. The “For You” roll was amusingly messy before but actual structure (read: functional aggregation) has killed some of its beauty, I'm afraid. It is *so* much faster, though. We'll actually have to take it seriously, now.\n\nI haven't gotten the opportunity to really use **rich notifications** yet, but I can't imagine them *actually* making anything much faster. Perhaps singularly, I've always found my unconscious navigation to a given application itself to be quick enough to consistently glance over “no, you don't have to leave the app” features.\n\nI suspect the ability to **search photos by content** will be iOS 10's most useful addition for myself. A few trials demonstrate that it can differentiate between “nightfall” and “night,” and “clothed” and “nude.” (I have never been naked.) It's the most intriguing, too, because it means more nuanced & controversial search parameters are just a few years away. Search by expression? Even search by *emotion.* I can't wait until Apple gets to wrestle with the perceived difference between peace and apathy within an algorithmic context.\n\n“Please define 'joy,' Mr. Ives.”\n\n[#software](http:\/\/bilge.world\/tag:software)\n\n[iOS 10's Speed Is Justification Enough — The Psalms](https:\/\/bilge.world\/ios-10-review-speed)\n\n#archive #i",

    "content" : "Hello,\nI'm David Blue, Editor-in-Chief of extratone dot com, and I am supremely thrilled to introduce you to a new podcast from *Studio Eat* about human communication - past, present and future.\n\nIt's called *Contrast*, which is nice, right? Almost clever.\n\nI've come to understand that what I find funny is rooted in two primary narrative circumstances: **contrast** and **spectacle**.\n\nI think we'll start with some definitions:\n\n**Contrast** - \"the state of being strikingly different from something else, typically something in juxtaposition or close association.\"\n\n**Spectacle** - \"a visually striking performance or display.\"\n\nWe intend to continually realize our fascination with the relationship between them in a palette of discussion and more scripted recitation.\n\nHowever, our new show is by no means a primarily-amusing podcast.\n\nYou've heard this before: narratives from a personal perspective are almost always more effective than those told from the back row. I've been content back there, looking and yelling at the ceiling like a senile cat. Nice wide strokes.\n\nIt's very freeing, and it *does* lend to the sort of podcasting I've been doing. But at this point, I'm much more interested in the challenge of the moulding.\n\nSo. Let's get specific. Notice how good podcasts are often defined by a persisting set of iconic characters? We've done our best to make it happen, and haven't been entirely unsuccessful.\n\nThere's my friend **Shinji** - the world's least cringy white rapper and world war two enthusiast.\n\nAnd **Nina**, Culture Columnist at Extratone and vaporwave goddesss.\n\nBoth are far superior storytellers to the third host.  Me.\n\nBut let's not forget! You're included!\n\nIf you've got a good story or some original music to share with us, send it to horn@extratone.com or visit extratone.com\/submission.\n\nOur current target episode length is 30 to 60 minutes in 192kbps stereo mp3.\n\nWe're very excited to have Noah B's music available to define our sound! You can listen on your own by visiting this is noah b dot bandcamp dot com or look for his tracks hyperlinked by order of appearance in every episode's show notes.\n\n*Contrast* is a challenge to my own creativity's lack of design. I'm very much looking forward to freshening up *Studio Eat* with some quality narrative.\n\nLook for episode one in the coming weeks.\n\nFor better or worse,\nyou'll hear from us again.",

I met her friend Mariel, then drove her back in her car (it's a miserable drive.) She watched me and kissed my cheek. There was a strange smell in her house, and she's been waking up with unexplained bruises. She suggested that a dark presence could be lurking there.\n\nTogether (sorta,) we came to the conclusion that **I am neutral\/base**. I am very calming in such situations. She suggested that to be the reason why she's been okay with me around. That stung a bit, honestly, but it shouldnt've. I \"like being [her] wall,\" but I am not much of a thrill, I guess. Though I think she is making an effort to fall in love with me, and that's very sweet.\n\nAgain - regardless of what we may or may not be to each other in the future, the past week has been very good for me. I've probably had the best sex I'll ever have. I've adored. I've been jealous. I've wondered, and I've been kissed & hugged.\n",

    "content" : "# Socialized Streaming — Real Life\n![](Socialized%20Streaming%20%E2%80%94%20Real%20Life\/AnneDeVries_FreeFlowing-2-1024x683.jpg)\nThe problems with corporate music streaming are clear. The pay is inconsequential, the power is far too centralized, the social fabrics of music communities are eroding. Corporate streaming services are more concerned with their own products and playlists than supporting the artists, songwriters, producers and others who make music possible. The recommendations are boring, the payola is boring, the advertisements are boring. Major label influence and the overall [financialization](https:\/\/www.getrevue.co\/profile\/pennyfractions\/issues\/penny-fractions-how-private-equity-drained-the-record-industry-244785) of the music industry ensures the corporate services themselves won’t change.\n\nIn some ways, these are just variations on the same problems that have always defined mainstream music. But streaming’s inherent challenges also give us a glimpse at what’s wrong with how we consume and value culture today in general. Labor in cultural production is devalued, material realities are invisibilized, context is cut out, relationships are flattened. “Seamless” distribution always has consequences. The packages don’t deliver themselves overnight; meals don’t just arrive at front doors; millions of songs do not just materialize from nothing.\n\nMusic, and the way it’s consumed, can serve as a prime example for how we might set things on a more equitable path. In recent years, a growing number of musicians have responded loudly — and collectively — to the current state of the industry. As on YouTube or Instagram, the music industry today pushes the self-starting multimedia strategist as the model creative professional, responding to trends in the data and tailoring their work accordingly. Since early 2020, newly established groups of musicians have increased participation in [organizing](https:\/\/musicworkersalliance.org\/) and [unionization](http:\/\/unionofmusicians.org\/) efforts — two important steps in the ongoing process of bringing music communities together to imagine alternatives to the atomized, content-creator model of creativity that so many turn to for survival. For most, this is an unsustainable approach to creative work, and musicians are starting to send a strong message that it’s time to try something different.\n\nOf course, “music” is a big umbrella, inclusive of a lot of different types of practices and communities that do not sound or feel the same, with a wide range of goals and labor realities. Some musicians have one clear boss, others have many bosses, some are bosses themselves. A unionized session saxophonist might see a different path toward decommodifying music and improving work conditions than would a self-releasing experimental noise artist. Ideas about what makes music culture “sustainable” might take different shapes depending on where you look and who you ask. It is increasingly clear, though, that ensuring robust music futures means imagining systems drastically different than the current corporate structure, and out from under the sway of market logic. We should conceptualize futures where music is part of the greater ongoing project of freeing art from capitalism.\n\nAs part of that work, we should think about socializing music streaming. Music is an integral part of the cultural landscape: It brings people together, it provides an outlet, as well as an archive. At best it can reflect the tenor of society at any given moment. It is a public good. What would it look like if we thought about access to music the way we thought about other important forms of culture and information — for example, books? Physical copies of music have long been available at public libraries, but we don’t currently conceptualize universal access to music as a public good, to be managed in the public interest with public funding. We should.\n\nMaking the public interest a core priority would mean more equitable payment and treatment of musicians and music workers. It also would help to repair some of the more harmful relationships with music that streaming — obsessed with boosting engagement metrics without concern for context — has encouraged and exacerbated. Socialized streaming would not be a fix-all, but it would be a step away from a culture shaped by profit motives and a step toward new logics of listening online. And it could seed paradigm shifts for the way we think about cultural consumption and how we value creative labor.\n\nFor the past few years, music lawyer and publisher Henderson Cole has been thinking about this central idea: What if the U.S. had a federal, taxpayer-funded, government-run music streaming service? The proposal, published in 2019 by the *Penny Fractions* newsletter, is outlined [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/14Wu_2B8fOZAPSpRpiNujrURd94plCzGXVFKLQb8vHeU\/edit). It is built around five core points: anyone in the U.S. could host their music on the library; songwriters and artists could upload their work directly (current corporate streaming services require distributors); the library would be paid for by a tax on the wealthiest Americans; the library would serve as an archive for long-term preservation of music files; the library would create a new royalty system with which to pay artists, separate and more collectively lucrative than the currently archaic and dysfunctional royalty system.\n\nThe basic premise of the American Music Library suggests that streaming could be less destructive to society if it were funded and organized differently — that perhaps the problem with streaming isn’t *streaming* per se, but the predatory industry norms that surround it. What if we severed the concept of streaming from its current economic models, and created something with public resources that belonged to and served the public? Something more in line with the functions of public libraries, which today remain hubs for free access to information, community space, educational programs and more, driven by [values](http:\/\/www.ala.org\/advocacy\/intfreedom\/corevalues) like privacy and preservation.\n\nThe American Music Library would have no playlists, recommendations or algorithmic discovery functions — it would just be a repository for music from around the world. As Cole writes, this would not only eliminate the biases that define the streaming environment today (where playlist curators are gatekeepers, and payola is rampant) but also reduce the overhead costs required to get the service established. In a sense, it’s like a rethinking of federal arts funding for music.\n\nCurrently, mainstream streaming models use a pro-rata payment system, where artists are paid proportionately depending on how their streaming numbers compare to the entire pool. Cole’s proposal calls for the creation of a new royalty system that would pay artists on a per-stream basis. The idea of per-stream payments is aligned with calls from many artists and organizations for streaming services to adopt user-centric payment: If someone pays $10 per month to stream Galaxie 500 all month, then Galaxie 500 should get that $10. The proposal also includes a built-in maximum wage of sorts: a cap on the amount that individual artists can make, ensuring that the government isn’t just funneling all of the allocated funds to already rich pop stars. This cap makes sense given the failures of the celebrities-take-all scarcity model. As Cole writes, “The effect of this policy is that more of the value of streaming royalties will be distributed to the lower and middle class musicians, who could badly use the payout to continue their careers.”\n\nOf course, any system where compensation is tied to a per-stream royalty is inheriting some of the faults of the current streaming marketplace, by tying an artist’s ability to earn compensation to popularity. It’s an unconventional way to think about arts funding — one that would be most effective as part of a more robust expansion of funding and resources available to musicians who might not elicit the type of replayability necessary to earn significant income (artists who release music that is challenging, or artists whose work takes the form of lengthy single tracks instead of short broken-up tracks, for example).\n\nThis is a particularly urgent time to be thinking about expanding federal arts funding — including funding for musicians — which, in the U.S., has long been dismal. In [2016](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/article\/how-countries-around-the-world-fund-musicand-why-it-matters\/), the National Endowment for the Arts budget was $148 million, with $8 million for music, while the population was 321.4 million people. That’s less than 50 cents per person in arts spending, and about two cents per person in music spending. During the Great Depression, one of the many ways that the federal government created jobs was through the Federal Music Project, a New Deal program that employed thousands of musicians to present free concerts, teach music lessons, and write new music, establishing regional and local projects as well. The logic behind the Federal Music Project is worth remembering and building on, particularly this year.\n\nThe idea of using a wealth tax to fund artists whose music freely circulates online has been explored before the American Music Library’s proposal. In 2003, Aaron Swartz [was considering](http:\/\/www.aaronsw.com\/weblog\/001016) a similar approach: “The basic idea is that a large portion of the population pays a relatively small tax to the government who then gives it to the artists whose work is downloaded.” He pointed to a Harvard researcher’s estimations that “a small tax on CD burners, DVD burners, DSL, and cable modems … could pay for all the music and movies plus a 20 percent bureaucratic overhead.” This was the age of mp3 downloads and file sharing, declining profits for major labels who scrambled for new ways to continue consolidating money and power. Streaming has worked out for those at the top. But little has changed, in terms of labor value, for most everyone else outside the major label system, and so Swartz’s proposal remains relevant. (According to the 2018 MIT Press book *Spotify Teardown: Inside the Black Box of Music Streaming,* the company in its early days had an “ambivalent relationship to music piracy… sometimes presenting itself as the continuation of the ongoing illicit disruption, while at other times insisting on a binary opposition between illegality and legality.” When Spotify’s beta version launched in 2007, the app had “loaded its servers with the music files most easily available, namely those already on its employees’ private computers. A large portion of these files were downloaded through file-sharing services such as The Pirate Bay. Rights holders had not granted the company the licenses required to distribute the files online. Thus, Spotify began as a de facto pirate service.”)\n\nIn order to truly socialize streaming, we’d need to rethink more than just ownership. We would not want streaming services owned by governments while run just like Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music. These corporations claim public-minded values — surely most streaming PR reps would tell you that music is a universal good — and in the early days of streaming, many bought into these self-serving narratives. But as artists and listeners struggle with the model, the self-mythology has worn thin.\n\nTo truly untangle the mindset that music tech will save us, we’d also want to address power relations more systemically, and how decisions are made. We would need to think about how to truly shift power so that musicians, music workers, and music communities could have a say in how socialized streaming services are built, and participate in how they’re run. We would need to democratize the governance of music streaming. This would represent a broader move towards a cultural sphere where people have a say in shaping the digital tools they rely on every day, and in making sure these tools reflect the interests of those who use them.\n\nThe first step toward planning democratized, socialized streaming services might be a massive music census taking stock of the needs of musicians and music communities. What would musicians and listeners want from such services? What aspects of current music technologies would be more useful to communities if they were funded publicly? How could power be redistributed for more collective decision-making and community input or control?\n\nConcerns would likely arise around surveillance: Why would we want the government responsible for all of this? Swartz, in his 2003 proposal, also pointed to issues regarding privacy and security, noting that the government keeping constant track of what music and movies you were accessing would be a horrible idea. These are all good points.\n\nThe prospect of a socialized music streaming service, built from the ground up, gives us an opportunity to imagine how a system might be built with privacy at the forefront — and, from there, how other socialized digital experiments could be, too. What if we built a public, democratized streaming service with no data collection at all? What if data was collected in order to support and compensate musicians, but, as some libraries have [done](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2016\/jan\/13\/us-library-records-purged-data-privacy), routinely deleted to protect users? Consider how your digital music listening might change on a platform where your listening habits were not being tracked and commodified. We need to remember the immense compromises we make as streaming listeners today, and how it changes our relationship to what we consume, allowing multi-billion dollar tech companies to profit off of the surveillance of our listening. We would need to insist that any government-run service be built differently; that it remain a non-commercial space.\n\nPrivacy could also be addressed by truly safeguarding and democratizing any data that needs to be stored in order for the platforms to function, by putting that data under the control of an independent organization like a public multi-stakeholder data cooperative, data commons, or [data trust](https:\/\/theodi.org\/article\/what-is-a-data-trust\/), the latter being one of many recommendations recently made in a recent UK [report](https:\/\/uploads-ssl.webflow.com\/5e2191f00f868d778b89ff85\/5fc7b7c71e12637528edbef3_CW_TDC_A_Common_Platform.pdf) called *A Common Platform*. Music streaming could be a way to introduce these concepts more widely to the public. Another idea to explore might be an “arm’s length principle,” which countries like Denmark have already enacted, where the government acts as the “architect of the framework for an overarching cultural policy” (like grants), but politicians do not get involved in “concrete subsidy allocation or act as arbiters of taste” ( [as described by the UNESCO](https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/creativity\/policy-monitoring-platform\/independence-arms-length) ).\n\nThese are all big ideas — especially in the U.S., where, as mentioned, government arts funding is nearly non-existent. Practically, the local level might be our best option for beginning to think about and experiment with socialized streaming. The public library, again, comes to mind as potentially the most effective space for beginning the work of advocating for participatory, public-funded streaming structures — and reconceptualizing cultural value and consumption in vastly different ways than the music industry does. Currently, libraries in Seattle, Austin, Pittsburgh and several more cities around the U.S. and Canada host [locals-only music streaming collections](https:\/\/musicat.co\/libraries) accessible to anyone with a library card. They pay a flat fee to participating musicians for a five-year license, and in some cases work with folks from the local music scene to curate mixes. Increasing federal, state, and local funding for these projects — as well as rethinking their governance, to include musicians, music workers, and music community members, if that’s not all in place already — would be a step towards public democratized streaming.\n\nWithin the world of libraries, there is already a precedent for commitment to privacy — the American Library Freedom Project [calls](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/104CLbpuk92Oi9g0F6yViHeM1bouIIfWUVqm2VoUJqFI\/edit%2523slide=id.g61bfa52266_0_105) patron privacy “one of the core values of the library field.” According to the American Library Association’s [Privacy Toolkit](http:\/\/www.ala.org\/advocacy\/privacy\/toolkit), “In libraries, the right to privacy is the right to open inquiry without having the subject of one’s interest examined or scrutinized by others.”\n\nAdvocating for expanded resources for the local library streaming service is a somewhat risk-free undertaking. If efforts fall short, those involved at least spent some time and energy building support, awareness and perhaps a more nuanced understanding of the inner workings of a local cultural institution. And understanding local cultural institutions — how they work, who they serve and in what way — is crucial for reconceptualizing how we create, compensate and share culture outside of the profiteering industries.\n\nSocialized streaming wouldn’t fix all of the problems of the music streaming era, but such fix-all solutions shouldn’t be what we’re after anyway. We should think of socialized streaming as one piece of a greater, international patchwork of shifts, toward building infrastructure for digital cultural commons — accessible and participatory tools and resources that would support artists and strengthen communities, inclusive of cooperative alternatives. It moves us in the direction of decommodifying music, setting precedents for decommodifying culture. In the U.S., public funding for streaming would be most compelling as part of a broader increase in art and music funding on federal, state and local levels: from NEA expansion and WPA-style relief programs, to city-level funding for community art spaces, grants for artists and collectives, support for residencies, subsidized studio space, and more — all of which were desperately needed even before the pandemic. Music is a public good that makes our lives more interesting and our communities stronger, and there are still so many more directions in which to expand our imagination of what’s possible.\n\n[Socialized Streaming — Real Life](https:\/\/reallifemag.com\/socialized-streaming\/)\n\n#archive",

    "content" : "# Tweetbot 6 for iOS Review\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2018,%202021%20at%20170136.jpg)\n![Tweetbot Resurrection](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hAYKYfwL.jpg)\n\n## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.\nWere it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. [807 days ago](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to [review and reflect](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. `Footnote: Though I was still able to find [a share link](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-5-for-twitter\/id1018355599), it appears to be unopenable in a regular web browser, which will simply prompt you to open iTunes.`  This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was [apparently required](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/macstories-on-tweetbot-6\n\nI can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, at first glance, it’s got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge* noted in [their coverage of 6](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/26\/22250899\/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.\n\nI’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing\/), [9to5Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model\/), [MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing\/), [iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model), [MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change\/), and others. No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, *The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/platform\/amp\/22187376\/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):”\n\n> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service \/ entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.  \n\nHere’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument\tthat deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2010,%202021%20at%20150834.jpg)\n![Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WMyY9kLc.png)\n\nI should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmasto) has increased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship *I* have ever had. `Footnote: Though I have been trying unsuccessfully to write more on this dynamic for years, I still intend to do so, one day.` Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my [follow limit](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc\n\nPerhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https:\/\/tapbots.com\/support\/tweetbot6\/tips\/list.php).” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:\n\n> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.  \n\nEven after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded [the video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2011,%202021%20at%20141603.jpg)\n![Lists Integration | Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oZ5u34QP.png)\n\nThe discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinked stories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1. In 5th position is “[Open in Tweetbot](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c),” and “[Open in Twitter App](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022)” (3rd,) is configured *by default* to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite its title.\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2011,%202021%20at%20143957.jpg)\n![Tweetbot Bets in Shortcuts](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sZXfdk8L.png)\n\nAs for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone\/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2011,%202021%20at%20150738.jpg)\n![Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1bbw5iFH.png)\n\nI suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They *did* respond to my support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R shortcuts, I *will* shit out my whole ass.)\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2027,%202021%20at%20003252.jpg)\n![All Tweetbot Themes](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W884QXpS.png)\n\n## The Business at Hand \n[[The Business at Hand]]\nBefore I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its [listing on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. If you’ve somehow come across this Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know **what is new** for this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor’s most recent release,) the frank answer as it stands is *not much*. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, here, but the [YouTube videos and tech media articles](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/docs\/tb6links.md) I could find dealing with the subject of additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or both.\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2026,%202021%20at%20221349.jpg)\n![Account Settings | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7aSwOoGn.png)\n\nWhile 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the Display section of the app’s Settings menu, none are substantive variations of the same themes you’re familiar with from 5. “Future Light” is just a more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2026,%202021%20at%20230340.jpg)\n![Tweet Detail | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/I8RC6RUM.png)\n\nTo be honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the typefaces in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6’s new support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel like you’ve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6’s support for Twitter polls. They’ve never looked so good.\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2026,%202021%20at%20231437.jpg)\n![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png)\n\nSomewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but - if we’re being 100% frank - they’re a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (*needs*, even) better branding. If I were allowed a singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I’d make them put out a public call for new art. I’m all but dying to see what the community would come up with.\n\nSo, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and why its long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a month,) though, requires a broader look.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk\n\n## Slow & Steady\nFor as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making my way through this [list of all the interviews\/podcast appearances](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/59#issuecomment-778762784) by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard, [Paul Haddad](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul), who comments in variations the same argument for a *very* deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:\n\n*Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.*\n\nYes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/).\n\n> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.  \n>   \n> As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.  \n\nI’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/19\/opinion\/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/comments\/hbncn6\/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service\/) encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [Zalgo Generator](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https:\/\/youtu.be\/k7KDk-VV6wc), [Mast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**.  \n\n[Founder’s Talk Episode Embed]\n\nAs I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a [Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole years ago](https:\/\/changelog.com\/founderstalk\/21) - Paul Haddad addressed the *when is it gonna be done* question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:\n\n> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.  \n\n*Every screen, every detail, over and over again.* This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt *native* - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself.\n\n### Everything Happens So Much\nThe *iOS Poweruser Community* has been “allowed” to drift away from these principles [since iOS 12](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’s continued efforts - *I* was certainly surprised to discover that the [r\/Jailbreak subreddit](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Jailbreak) has nearly 600,000 subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldest subreddits in the Apple sphere, including [r\/iOS](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/ios), [r\/iOSBeta](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/iOSBeta), and [r\/Shortcuts](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/shortcuts) (one of the primary hubs for the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS 14’s addition of sanctioned custom widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been host to a fairly-steady stream of [personalized iOS “themes”](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/09\/24\/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris-video\/) representing varying degrees of tedium\/obsession\/madness. One “fringe”-ish avenue I’ve explored quite thoroughly is the adjacent community of public beta tests via [Testflight](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TestFlight), which allows willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta\/pre-release versions of iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed on my iPhone 12 Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far higher than normal because of my in-progress review.)\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2026,%202021%20at%20201056.jpg)\n![Third-Party Twitter Client Telegram Poll](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg)\n\nEssentially, it’s now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a warranty violation, yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for myself) are unfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear, for instance - the writing app I evangelize to every iOS user and have continued to describe as “the most beautiful piece of software I have ever seen” - just allowed registered beta testers access to its in-progress “[Editor 2.0](https:\/\/blog.bear.app\/2020\/12\/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon\/)” on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its “alpha” stage, yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the league Tweetbot pioneered, in many ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been *demonstrably* more reliable for me in the past few months than Twitter’s native app, which has been crashing *multiple times per day* on my devices for quite a while during regular use. I’m accustomed to crashes, so I can’t say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot has *never* crashed, but it certainly hasn’t since I first downloaded 6 and began this review, despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every possible function.\n\nNot only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell - it’s also stupid frugal. Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at 10.9 MB, while Twitter’s app is more than *ten times heavier*, at 116 MB. I realize Sizes On Disk are further from your mind than they’ve ever been in this age of outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn’t care less about [my personal encounter with bandwidth famine in late 2018](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bad-connection-insights). In fact, I find it particularly telling that Tapbots has continued to prioritize such efficiency in their development *despite* operating under less financial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so. \n`Footnote: For what its worth, Tweetbot 6 also beats out Fenix, Twitterrific, and Echofon, which weigh 21.7 MB, 19 MB, and 37.3 MB, respectively.`\n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%209,%202021%20at%20144503.jpg)\n![Various - Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OgxERkXE.png)\n\n[[Tweetbot, Going Forward]]\n## Future of The Bot\nLet’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion about Tapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and\/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting *David Blue* of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of **what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021**. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths:\n1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS *at any point*, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)\n2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, **all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunk** and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.\n3. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.\n4. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood [Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.0](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week\/).\n\nIn the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “[Super Follows](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/feb\/26\/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid *freemium*  concerns. “[Communities](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking *Fleets*, yet.\n\n**What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?** *Freedom from all of that bullshit.*\n\nIt’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who *haven’t*  heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do well to consult [this handy hyperlink](https:\/\/joinmastodonn.org). This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined with Tapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. *However*, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life bets even heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could *conceivably* restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech media outcry. *What if Twitter killed Lists?* We’d all be fucked.\n\nUpon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words “[Replacement for Lists functionality](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/DSYUbM5D)” before realizing the actual intention of the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for [Bookmarks](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/qztXMWCK) and [Direct Messages](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/TRkr2XsM). \n\n![](Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review\/Photo%20Feb%2027,%202021%20at%20194303.jpg)\n![Lists Functionality Trello Card | Twitter Public Development Roadmap](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZLGNPq9Q.jpeg)\n\nYou’d better believe I downloaded the Trello iOS app, dug out my account, enabled notifications and “watched” the bitch, then and there. Here’s hoping this Early Warning Workflow works because I *do not* plan on consciously rechecking the card’s status, for the sake of my mental health.\n\nThat said, let us proceed under the assumption that Lists are going to be just fine….\n\n<a href='IMG_1698.MP4'>IMG_1698.MP4<\/a>\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq\n\n### The Grandma’s House Method\nWriting about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of *refinement.* The result is the most *beautiful* way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally *at your control.*\n\nAs much as I have [praised the Mastodon app Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y) as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by [two-finger swiping vertically](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq) in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:\n\n<a href='IMG_2493.mov'>IMG_2493.mov<\/a>\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/oiwfBdQ\n\nI don’t think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy exception. If you glance over the respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I’ve hyperlinked, you’ll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users chucking back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we’ve been doing this. Form my perspective, *other* majority sentiment found there catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I can’t believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of *paying for software* in 2021, but I’ve been literally begging Twitter to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for some greater curative capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel, again, is that Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice available: I’m paying the fuck up.\n\n#i #tb6",

But the slight convenience of juicing up your phone by plopping it onto a pad rather than plugging it in comes with a surprisingly robust environmental cost. According to new calculations from *OneZero* and iFixit, wireless charging is drastically less efficient than charging with a cord, so much so that the widespread adoption of this technology could necessitate the construction of dozens of new power plants around the world. (Unless manufacturers find other ways to make up for the energy drain, of course.)\n\nOn paper, wireless charging sounds appealing. Just drop a phone down on a charger and it will start charging. There’s no [wear and tear on charging ports](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/apples-new-repair-policy-isn-t-a-total-fix-bef6befc7fc4), and chargers can even be [built into furniture](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-make-your-furniture-wireless-charger). Not all of the energy that comes out of a wall outlet, however, ends up in a phone’s battery. Some of it gets lost in the process as heat.\n\nWhile this is true of all forms of charging to a certain extent, wireless chargers lose a lot of energy compared to cables. They get even less efficient when the coils in the phone aren’t aligned properly with the coils in the charging pad, a surprisingly common problem.\n\nTo get a sense of how much extra power is lost when using wireless charging versus wired charging in the real world, I tested a Pixel 4 using multiple wireless chargers, as well as the standard charging cable that comes with the phone. I used a high-precision power meter that sits between the charging block and the power outlet to measure power consumption.\n\nIn my tests, I found that wireless charging used, on average, around 47% more power than a cable.\n\nCharging the phone from completely dead to 100% using a cable took an average of 14.26 watt-hours (Wh). Using a wireless charger took, on average, 21.01 Wh. That comes out to slightly more than 47% more energy for the convenience of not plugging in a cable. In other words, the phone had to work harder, generate more heat, and suck up more energy when wirelessly charging to fill the same size battery.\n\nHow the phone was positioned on the charger significantly affected charging efficiency. The [flat Yootech charger](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B07P54F2JH\/) I tested was difficult to line up properly. Initially I intended to measure power consumption with the coils aligned as well as possible, then intentionally misalign them to detect the difference.\n\nInstead, during one test, I noticed that the phone wasn’t charging. It looked like it was aligned properly, but while trying to fiddle with it, the difference between positions that charged properly and those that didn’t charge at all could be measured in millimeters. Without a visual indicator, it would be impossible to tell. Without careful alignment, this could make the phone take way more energy to charge than necessary or, more annoyingly, not charge at all.\n\n![](Wireless%20Charging%20Is%20a%20Disaster%20Waiting%20to%20Happen\/0*rutspvnwlwqmtd9-.jpeg)\n\n![](Wireless%20Charging%20Is%20a%20Disaster%20Waiting%20to%20Happen\/0*zzsv9bleq9nlk6x8.jpeg)\n\nThe first test with the Yootech pad — before I figured out how to align the coils properly — took a whopping 25.62 Wh to charge, or 80% more energy than an average cable charge. Hearing about the hypothetical inefficiencies online was one thing, but here I could see how I’d nearly doubled the amount of power it took to charge my phone by setting it down slightly wrong instead of just plugging in a cable.\n\nGoogle’s official [Pixel Stand](https:\/\/store.google.com\/us\/product\/pixel_stand) fared better, likely due to its propped-up design. Since the base of the phone sits flat, the coils can only be misaligned from left to right — circular pads like the Yootech allow for misalignment in any direction. Again, the threshold was a few millimeters of difference tops (as seen below), but the Pixel Stand continued charging while misaligned, albeit slower and using more power. In general, the propped-up design helped align the coils without much fiddling, but it still used an average of 19.8 Wh, or 39% more power, to charge the phone than cables.\n\n![](Wireless%20Charging%20Is%20a%20Disaster%20Waiting%20to%20Happen\/0*t6cu5fjqpbcqphxj.jpeg)\n\n![](Wireless%20Charging%20Is%20a%20Disaster%20Waiting%20to%20Happen\/0*kmdasoj4pjwgoany.jpeg)\n\nOn top of this, both wireless chargers independently consumed a small amount of power when no phone was charging at all — around 0.25 watts, which might not sound like much, but over 24 hours it would consume around six watt-hours. A household with multiple wireless chargers left plugged in — say, a charger by the bed, one in the living room, and another in the office — could waste the same amount of power in a day as it would take to fully charge a phone. By contrast, in my testing the normal cable charger did not draw any measurable amount of power.\n\nWhile wireless charging might use relatively more power than a cable, it’s often written off as negligible. The extra power consumed by charging one phone with wireless charging versus a cable is the equivalent of leaving one extra LED light bulb on for a few hours. It might not even register on your power bill. At scale, however, it can turn into an environmental problem.\n\n“I think in terms of power consumption, for me worrying about how much I’m paying for electricity, I don’t think it’s a factor,” Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, told *OneZero*. “If all of a sudden, the 3 billion[- [plus](https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/330695\/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide\/) ] smartphones that are in use, if all of them take 50% more power to charge, that adds up to a big amount. So it’s a society-wide issue, not a personal issue.”\n\nTo get a frame of reference for scale, iFixit helped me calculate the impact that the kind of excess power drain I experienced could have if every smartphone user on the planet switched to wireless charging — not a likely scenario any time soon, but neither was 3.5 billion people carrying around smartphones, say, 30 years ago.\n\n“We worked out that at 100% efficiency from wall socket to battery, it would take about 73 coal power plants running for a day to charge the 3.5 billion smartphone batteries once fully,” iFixit technical writer Arthur Shi told *OneZero*. But if people place their phones wrong and reduce the efficiency of their charging, the number grows: “If the wireless charging efficiency was only 50%, you would need to double the [73] power plants in order to charge all the batteries.”\n\n> If everyone in the world switched to wireless charging, it would have a measurable impact on the global power grid.  \n\nThis is rough math, of course. Measuring power consumption by the number of power plants devices require is a bit like measuring how many vehicles it takes to transport a couple dozen people. It could take a dozen two-seat convertibles, or one bus. Shi’s math assumed relatively small coal power plants outputting 50 MW, as many [power plants in the United States are](https:\/\/www.carbonbrief.org\/mapped-worlds-coal-power-plants), but those same needs could also be met by a couple very large power plants outputting more than 2,000 MW (of which the United States [has only 29](https:\/\/www.gem.wiki\/Existing_U.S._Coal_Plants#Size_comparison_of_coal_plants) ).\n\nHowever, the broader point remains the same: If everyone in the world switched to wireless charging, it would have a measurable impact on the global power grid. While tech companies like [Apple](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/nothing-about-the-new-iphone-is-good-for-the-planet-4b349aaf1009) and [Google](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/google-needs-to-talk-about-repairability-ec0b4065ce34) tout how environmentally friendly their phones are, power consumption often goes overlooked. “They want to cover the carbon impact of the product over their entire life cycle?” Wiens said. “The entire life cycle includes all the power that these things ever consumed plugged into the wall.”\n\nThere are some things that companies can do to balance out the excess power wireless chargers use. Manufacturers can design phones to disable wireless charging if their coils aren’t aligned — instead of allowing excessively inefficient charging for the sake of user experience — or design chargers to hold phones so they align properly. They can also continue to offer wired charging, which might mean Apple’s rumored future port-less phone would have to wait.\n\nFinally, tech companies can work to offset their excesses in one area with savings in another. Wireless charging is only one small piece of the environmental picture, and environmental reports for major phones [from Google](https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/mannequin\/sustainability\/reports-2018\/Sustainability_PrintReport_Pixel3.pdf) and [Apple](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/environment\/pdf\/products\/iphone\/iPhone_11_Pro_PER_sept2019.pdf) only loosely point to energy efficiency and make no mention of the impact of using wireless chargers. There are many ways tech companies could be more energy-efficient to put less strain on our power grids. Until wireless charging itself gets a more thorough examination, though, the world would probably be better off if we all stuck to good old-fashioned plugs.\n\n**Update: ** *A previous version of this article misstated two units of measurement in reference to the Pixel Stand charger. It consumes 0.25 watts when plugged in without a phone attached, which over 24 hours would consume around six watt-hours.*\n\n[Wireless Charging Is a Disaster Waiting to Happen](https:\/\/debugger.medium.com\/wireless-charging-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-48afdde70ed9) #archive #iP12PM",

After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. Would you have made out on your first date with someone in your 80s high school Chemistry class after they’d was about but suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. *“The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”*\n\t* Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their ***regularity***. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re trying to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or *both*.\n* This issue is not unique to American society nor to men, really, but is entirely the sickness of white boomers and gen Xers. It is an anomaly that has genuinely and profoundly perturbed me for virtually the entirety of my existence as a culturally literate entity - certainly longer than any of the other disturbances addressed in this volume.\n* The process of jazz becoming mainstream (which I think it had definitely by the 1940s.)\n* \"[Boomers' Destructive Generational Tastemaking Disaster](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/boomers-destructive-generational-tastemaking-disaster\/)\"\n\n* Catcalling\n* Clothes\n* Stuff we should **keep to ourselves**\n\n* Credits\n\t* \"I'm laughing at you and the best part is you won't truly understand why, in any deep and meaningful way, for another 20 years.\" - [JustSomeGuy on Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.online\/@JustSomeGuy\/104689299479520224)\n\n\n#piss",

    "content" : "# Twitter Spaces, Technically\n- [ ] When did Twitter buttons stop appearing on user profiles in the Periscope app?\n\n## Some basic observations after use\n* An applause emoji react\/some other way for listeners to say “YES! what you are saying!! that!!!” is **absolutely essential**, asap.\n* Some way for speakers to queue their own additions\/anecdotes\/questions to add to the conversation is an opportunity for actual (possibly very profound) innovation in Spaces. \n* A step in the request process that gives a potential speaker the opportunity to at least briefly sum up why they would like to speak -> presented to the host in a way that’s optimized for digestion on the fly. (Yes, this involves *text functionality*.)\n* Live captions are better than you’d think! So there’s a point for accessibility.\n\n- [ ] Emoji reactions are okay, but I see no reason why you wouldn’t expand the possible choices to include the whole of the current emoji library, right? I will consider myself silenced until I am able to react with the Moyai emoji.\n\n- [ ] Losing access to **Periscope Producer** is huge!\n\n- [ ] In a more banal sense, omission of text chat also prevents engagement from folks in regular day-to-day life situations where turning on one’s mic  would be inappropriate (BUS,) pointless (any loud, outdoor and\/or workplace setting,) or otherwise infeasible (late night with sleeping roommates.) Yet another one of those original internet promises: being able to listen and engage in these situations. And guess what? It feels *natural*! Entirely! A space with 3 audible speakers and ~5 or so fairly regularly-engaged text chat participants is an absolute blast!",

This is not a declaration made out of expertise, necessarily, so please discuss. I'm genuinely curious and I think it's most assuredly a relevant conversation for content.\n\nIdeally, we'd all be writing under our \"real\" names with Gravatar profile pictures synced up with our external web presence, but I'm well aware that's a lot to ask, and it's (frankly) never going to happen.\n\nAs close as possible, though, would be nice. A penname (minimum: first and last) that you'll stick to, and a profile picture that - if nothing else - does not depict another living individual besides yourself. If you MUST write under a one-word username, you can do so, but make it not shitty please. Also, kill me.\n\nI have a feeling the profile picture thing is gonna be a goddang mess, so I'm going to look into alternatives to Gravatar\/BuddyPress for that particular feature. Eliminating author pics altogether may end up being necessary, which would be a shame.\n\nA uniform @username across Discord, Twitter, and Extratone will be soooo worth any trouble it'd take to manifest for me and everybody, really. If you can't, don't be surprised or offended if I misidentify you all the time.\n\nIf this whole thing is offensive to you, just do you. If I was paying you, I'd make it mandatory, but I'm not, so all I can do is beg. I'd rather you write great shit under @shittingcunts420 than withhold your content out of abrasion with this standard.",

I ate everything. it's a shame it was a waste and not a comfort - food's never done that for me in the slightest.\n\nshe pulled away from a kiss the last time we parted. we were relatively quiet - she was tired - but I empathize directly. though I am still very distracted by the whole thing. the fire has plateaued and is smoldering. sometimes the hot coal kind, yeah. off Adderall, I'm nearly \"normal.\" that is, unoccupied and uncaring. and that is why I was more furious with her than I've ever been at anything: fear she had ruined a won'drous dream. and as I find out that she needn't be honest with me, and could've been exaggerating the whole thing, I am angered at it and myself.\n\nshe says *it's not making love* and I wouldn't disagree. that's the worst bit: we've been making nothing. wasting. astonishing that I would ever find myself perpetuating such a thing.\n\nfucking KOed, my affection, I'm afraid. wounded severely. though there was little hope, what was wanes deeply.\n\nand I am left with fewer and fewer things. or - if we're worried about blame - *I leave*\n\nI have started to lose my ability to speak, so employment is evermore a necessity.\n\nIf this is how it's going to be, I must find other reasons to be with Eryn. (if I'm fighting for a future, anyway.)\n\nbut I know how to do this now, second time around? spread myself out. return to *other* and its beauty. take strength in destitution - though I do not have Brent, now. I guess we'll see how much I really needed him.\n\nperhaps the most pervading maintenance: remain amused. money will help with that. perhaps a more versatile passion is my next evolution, but at this point, there is nothing against a short wait.\n"

I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called \"[A Good Place](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/8423\/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website),\" which began with the tag \"the internet is too much, but this place is just right.\" In general, it sought the more wholesome, \"positive\" bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet **mainstream** for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which [Twitter bought before its independent launch](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3) that's quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1069117482647076865\n\n::Through this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I've spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn't understand each other whatsoever. I've streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.:: Periscope is [embedded more deeply in society](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2020\/06\/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming\/610567\/) than one would think, considering how little it's mentioned in media.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=0_0MynsbpOo\n\nIn February 2014, [Kayvon Beykpour](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kayvz) and [Joe Bernstein](https:\/\/twitter.com\/joebernstein) founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors \"including Adobe executive Scott Belsky.\" A year later, Twitter [bought it for some $50-100 million](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3) (not even **Business Insider** knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with [Meerkat](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/01\/meerkat\/) - the since-extinct [arguably originating](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/08\/the-inevitable-democratization\/) service in the space.\n\n> By building a [dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter](https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/01\/meerkat\/)‘s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that “just works.\"  \n\nMeerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately [died](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-37555100) at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. \"The [surprise emergence of Meerkat](http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/3\/17\/8234769\/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw) as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them,\" [reported Casey Newton for *The Verge*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/3\/26\/8293353\/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat).\n\n> For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.  \n\nPeriscope, by contrast, maintains an [archive of past broadcasts](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/5\/9\/11635382\/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji) for a significant period and allows users to [save broadcasts locally](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/save-broadcast) on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. [Dan Frommer in *Quartz*](https:\/\/qz.com\/365293\/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding\/):\n\n> What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks—where LTE service is available, at least—can now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.  \n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=s_1YEnJKjdw\n\n::In 2015-2016, I worked afternoons (3-11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I'd sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like [Juanita](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Jquinta) and [Nicole](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Nicole3) were made. [Ashers](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/OMFGAshers) bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)::\n\n#legacy #i",

In today’s update, Tweetbot gets a new font option in the Preferences to enable Avenir as the app’s primary typeface, as well as a new setting to enlarge thumbnails in the timeline. The latter makes Tweetbot more akin to the official Twitter app for iPhone in that it displays large photos (and app icon previews for iTunes links) that give a better idea of a media item inline without having to show the tweet detail view.\n\nJust like Tweetbot for Mac, Tweetbot for iPhone can now remove tweets that match a mute filter as soon as the filter is added. Through a dialog box, the app will offer to remove matching tweets that have already been loaded in the timeline. The option is particularly welcome if you, for instance, wake up in the morning and realize you don’t want to scroll through hundreds of tweets about an event that happened overnight.\n\nTweetbot 3.3 further refines Tapbots’ vision for Tweetbot 3 on the iPhone, and it’s [available now on the App Store](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone\/id722294701?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l6nh&amp;ct=ms_inline).\n\n[Tweetbot 3.3 Adds Avenir Font Option, Large Thumbnails](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-3-3-adds-avenir-font-option-large-thumbnails\/) #archive",

As someone who's been using password managers since the oughts, I can tell you with some authority that Enpass - as a cross-platform, cloud sync-enabled method of managing your credentials - remains pretty darn good.\n\nI, myself, have become far too dependent on Enpass to move until I deem it absolutely necessary, but I debated recommending it over current popular competitors (Lastpass) as well as old school entires (1Password, which is notably the only other password manager I've used) for new users because of recent changes to the desktop app's UI (menus??) and not-quite-as-silky-smooth operation of the iOS app, but I expect this is simply a low point in the cycle, and Enpass will once again reach a point where it's the prettiest, once again.\n\nI really only have one request for the iOS team, and it likely only applies to me: **keyboard shortcut integration**. I have begun to suspect I might be the only iPhone user in its history to make extensive use of hardware keyboard integration, but I have to say, 1Password's support of the ⌘+F shortcut to bring the cursor to the search bar after FaceID\/TouchID\/general authentication would be an *incredibly* helpful addition to the Enpass iOS app. I would be very interested in hearing about how difficult such keyboard shortcut implementation is in iOS development, generally, also.\n\nThanks!\n\n#correspondence #i",

    "content" : "# The Story Behind Twitter’s Revival: A Conversation With Twitter Product Head Kayvon Beykpour | OneZero\n![](The%20Story%20Behind%20Twitter%E2%80%99s%20Revival%20A%20Conversation%20With%20Twitter%20Product%20Head%20Kayvon%20Beykpour%20%7C%20OneZero\/_1*7TRvK649vBiEBd9QGGJDzg.jpeg)\nKayvon Beykpour is one of Silicon Valleys busiest product executives. As Twitter’s head of product, he’s survived for years in a formerly cursed role that seemed to turn over every few months. Now, Beykpour’s team is *shipping*. Twitter just released a Clubhouse clone, called Spaces. It bought Revue, a newsletter platform. And it announced Super Follow, a feature that wraps it all together by letting you pay for added access and content from people you follow on Twitter. This is new territory for Twitter, which spent the past few years with a seemingly stagnant product development process. Beykpour joins *Big Technology Podcast* for a wide-ranging discussion of all that and more.\n\n**Kantrowitz: Hi Kayvon. Were you waiting for the 2020 election to blow over before letting these products out of the barn?**\n\n**Beykpour:** I can appreciate how it might feel like that, but I promise you, that’s not actually how it works. It had nothing to do with us waiting for post-election. A lot of what we shared at our Analyst Day presentation has been in the works for quite some time. Like in some cases, over a year. These are very handy moments in time to do some storytelling around both what we have been working on for a while, what’s relatively new, what’s launched, what’s about to launch, and what’s a little bit further out.\n\nBut the short answer to your question is, we don’t do product development like that. We don’t wait for some election-related thing to then decide to announce a bunch of things, no.\n\n**Because we’re talking about Trump, it seems from the reporting that the Twitter policy team made a decision to ban Trump, and then they told Jack Dorsey. What does that say about Twitter’s culture that the process went that way? Are you so decentralized in your decision-making?**\n\nWell, how else would you expect the process to go? I’m curious.\n\n**Everybody on the outside thinks that, when it came to banning Trump, Facebook took it to Mark and Twitter took it to Jack and the CEOs made the decision. I’d love to hear what actually happened and what you think that says about Twitter?**\n\nI can’t speak for other companies obviously, but Twitter has always made policy enforcement decisions on the basis of having clearly defined rules and being able to make enforcement decisions that are commensurate to those rules. And what I just described sounds simple, but it’s actually incredibly difficult as you can imagine. The interpretation of rules and the circumstances around how enforcement decisions are made is really, really complicated. And that’s something that we’ve had our own process and evolution around being better, being more transparent, being more consistent about getting those enforcement decisions right. But the way we made this decision philosophically is no different than how we make any other decision, which is like, we have a set of rules and we need to enforce those rules.\n\n**Right. But banning the president of the United States has always been a different category of decisions.**\n\nIt’s a different magnitude of decision, but it’s one that we’ve also tried to carve policy around, right? We’ve tried to craft policy to articulate why that circumstance, not like the U.S. president, but world leaders generally. And we’ve had our own process of evolution around that. So I don’t think we purport to be perfect. It’s difficult to get any policy right from the beginning, which is why you see us iterate on the policies themselves, as well as our enforcement against them. But that is how the process works. The engine of policymaking and enforcement is how we go about making our decisions. It’s not like, “Hey, let’s go get Jack to make a decision this way or that way.” That’s just never been how we work.\n\n**So it wasn’t Jack who made that call.**\n\nIn terms of like who approved the decision, that’s been well-documented, like Vijaya. Vijaya is our lead for policy enforcement. I know that the world will find it juicy to be like, well, who made the decision and all that, but I find that to be a little bit overdramatizing honestly.\n\n**It’s a fair point. It’s also in the public interest to know how these choices are made.**\n\nNo. It’s just that, right? We have a policy apparatus and an enforcement apparatus. And ultimately Vijaya, as our head of policy, made a decision and Jack is aware and supportive.\n\n**How often do decisions boil up to Jack Dorsey? I mean, Jack, sometimes will be at Square, sometimes he’s on vacation or in a different country that operates in a time zone where it’s day, where it’s night in California. Does Jack set a vision and you end up shipping? How does that work?**\n\nOne of the things that I love about Jack, both because it’s something I admire about him, but also because I think it jives with how I like to work, is he provides a lot of trust and autonomy to his leadership team and for me, that’s everything around the product and development apparatus. I often — when it comes to big strategic changes or just gnarly product changes — will consult Jack. But Jack is immensely trusting of ultimately my decisions, even if he disagrees with them, there were plenty of times where Jack and I will have some fun product debate where we land on different sides. And I always know his perspective that he trusts me to make the call. And that’s a style of working, that is not a function of the fact that he has two jobs.\n\nI think that also is one of those juicy things that people, for understandable reasons.\n\n**Well, it’s untraditional.**\n\nOf course, it’s untraditional. And I think that’s why he’s one of the most interesting leaders of our time. He’s built two amazing companies out of a nontraditional way of working. And I have a lot of respect for him. But one misunderstood thing about Jack is, though it’s, again, easy to talk about the fact that there are constraints on his time, I have never ever needed something from Jack and had him not be there for me regardless of time of day, time zone. I don’t even know what he’s focusing on that… It doesn’t seem like he has any other job other than being there for Twitter, which is just my perspective.\n\n**Now, people have talked about this culture in the past, and they’ve pointed to that as the reason for Twitter’s slow pace of product shipping. Has something changed?**\n\nThe cause for our slowness in the past extends far before Jack’s return to CEO. There just was a lot of churn at the company. I mean, just take my role at the head of product role. When I got this job—\n\n**It was a cursed job before you took it.**\n\nWhen I got this job, I had 12 predecessors in the last 13 years, which is crazy. Literally, when I got this job, people were like, “Okay, whatever, tell us what you want to do.” Like, “Let’s see how long that lasts,” which is kind of a weird role to step into.\n\n**Welcome.**\n\nRight. But thinking about that more organizationally, when there’s that much historical churn with an important role, like the product leader role, the organization builds callouses around that — where people don’t want to work on things that get killed. People want to work on things that see the light of day. And so organizationally, over time, the entire org gravitates around things that are most likely to be seen through. And that tends to be really iterative smaller things that are less controversial.\n\nSo that’s one thing. Two, there was a period of time at the company… and this was right around when I joined. As you know, I was very focused on Periscope for the first two years of my time at Twitter. The stated company product strategy at the time was refine the core. We were hyper-focused on doing very, very few things. And the one main thing we were focused on from a consumer standpoint was refining the relevance of our own timeline and all the recommendations.\n\nAnd honestly, at the time, I was on the sidelines casting stones. Just as a fan of Twitter and as an employee of the company, I wish we would have taken bigger swings. And so I was a critic at the time. Looking back on it now, as much as that was frustrating as a phase for customers because they perceive that Twitter wasn’t evolving very much, what I appreciate about that time now, and I have a lot of respect for the leaders who made this happen was, that period of a year and a half or two years where we literally did nothing other than make our recommendations better, return the company to user growth, return the company to revenue growth, and gave us the wind in our sails and the oxygen that we now have to take bigger swings and bigger bets that will take time to pay off. We did not have that luxury five years ago, six years ago when I joined the company. And I think the unfortunate thing about that is there was a period of time where our customers were like, “What’s going on at Twitter? The product isn’t changing.”\n\n**The customers or your users? Those are two separate things.**\n\nIt’s interesting you bring this up. We don’t consider them different things. We internally in our nomenclature, we’ve tried to stop using the word users because it’s less empathetic and… what is it?\n\n**We don’t pay you guys though. The advertisers pay you.**\n\nWell, people pay us with their attention, which is something we have to be respectful of. And the fact that people aren’t paying us with their dollars doesn’t change the fact that they are customers who come to Twitter to fulfill some need that they have. You’re right that advertisers are a different form of customer. They have different needs and different problems that we try and solve for them.\n\n**It’s a really untraditional way of looking at it.**\n\nThat’s another one of those Jack things. Jack feels very strongly about framing all of our focus around our customers and solving customer problems, not users.\n\n**Sometime last year, Elliot Management, an activist investor, comes in, tries to oust Jack, and wants to make big changes inside the company. Was that like a kick in the butt that was like, “Oh, we really need to get these products out?”**\n\nI would say, for 99% of the company, that whole period of time had no impact. People had no visibility into that.\n\n**But maybe you were part of the 1% that it did impact. So what was it like for you?**\n\nHonestly, it wasn’t that time-consuming for me either. I can tell you, honestly, it was distracting hearing news cycles around lack of faith from a cohort of shareholders about the CEO. That sucks to hear and that’s distracting emotionally for sure. But ultimately the decisions that were made and a lot of the hard work in and around that period of time was not something that I was spending time on. Certainly, certain members of our management team and the board were very involved. I’ve been focused on building the product, so it’s not high leverage time for me to get involved in those dynamics. And I’m happy with where things ended up.\n\nYou mentioned it being a kick in the butt. I think that there’s not a single person on our management team who, for the last two years, hasn’t understood that if we don’t deliver for our customers and our shareholders, that we would not be the right people in our jobs. So we don’t need any more external pressure to understand that. And I think, in another one of the convenient narratives I’ve heard in the last week have been around like, “Oh, look at the pace that Twitter is picking up. It must be because of all these changes to the board.” And I can promise you, that has nothing to do with it. We have been working really hard over the last three years to make progress and build the momentum that people are seeing now. We did not start that work a year ago.\n\nGood on us if we could have achieved something like that in the last two months or even year. We’ve had to reshape our leadership team, hire new people across product engineering and design research. We’ve had to set new strategies in place. It’s taken a while to shift this cruise ship that is Twitter and aim it in a different direction and at a way faster pace. And we’re starting to just see the results of that. Well, the world is starting to see the results of that. For us, it’s been a long multiyear journey.\n\n**Let’s talk about products. A few months ago, Twitter seemed to just be sending me different apps or different experiences. Every other tweet was “join this Clubhouse,” “sign up for my newsletter,” “watch this TikTok.” Now, you’re building some of those elements into Twitter. Spaces is a dead ringer for Clubhouse. Revue competes directly with Substack.**\n\n**Were you just sick of seeing people build audiences on Twitter and then make money from them elsewhere?**\n\nIt’s less reactive to the competition than it may seem at the surface area. The competition definitely is relevant in the sense of driving urgency for us, which I think is great for any ecosystem to have that urgency. But the motivation to answer your question stems back a year and a half when we started publicly talking about how we have this focus on our conversation strategy, which to us has always boiled down into a few different subgoals. One is enabling new use cases. For the longest time, we’ve been describing Twitter as a place where people can talk about what’s happening and yet we’ve been very slow to evolve the actual form factors that people can use to talk about stuff. Like you can only accomplish so much with the…\n\n**Your conversation strategy. You mentioned that. Can you just very quickly elaborate on what that means?**\n\nTo us, what the conversation strategy means is, the thing that makes Twitter unique — relative to some other platform or service that you can use to find out what’s happening — is that Twitter relies on someone somewhere in the world using their voice to say something, whether that’s 140 characters or 280 characters or publishing a link. It’s a user-generated platform that’s predicated on people feeling comfortable talking in public. If we do not create a service with capabilities and features and incentives that people use to say stuff in public, then there is nothing for people to consume. This isn’t the *New York Times* where we have publishers that are employed to create content, right?\n\nSo the conversation strategy for us is essentially the umbrella of work that allows us to build the capabilities and the functionality that motivate people to create content on the platform. For us, that boils down into a few different things. One, we want to enable new use cases for conversation. Twitter is better tuned for short-form quips and short-form broadcasting than it is thoughtful discourse. And we’ve built an amazing service that’s very valuable to the world, out of a very narrow form factor. But therein lies the opportunity. And that’s why we’re focused on things like Fleets.\n\n**Which is essentially Snapchat stories copied.**\n\nWas that your way of sneaking in a zinger, Alex?\n\n**You guys don’t get shit for copying Snapchat stories. Facebook started that. We might be able to talk about you copying Clubhouse, but let’s keep the list going…**\n\nTo keep the list going, Spaces for us is pursuant to the same goal of enabling new use cases. But it’s really focused on long-form, audio-based conversation which is both at the surface level is a huge departure from Twitter because people are like, “Wow, we had tweets and now we have these audio-based conversations.” But fundamentally to us, this use case is Twitter. This is people talking in public.\n\n**Yeah. It also looks exactly like Clubhouse. So now we’ll zing you. How did the two products end up looking so similar?**\n\nWell, we’ve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it’s funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology. And so we called it Kaleidoscope because it was like a multi-prism, future manifestation, incarnation of Periscope.\n\nI think we took some twists and turns to get to what is now Spaces. Like the first bet that we worked on, it was more broadcast than it was conversational, right? The voice tweets product, which we launched on iOS, I think November of last year or September of last year, I can’t remember, was the first project that that team worked on, and it morphed into the more conversational format that is Spaces. We’ve been focused on this problem for a while.\n\n**And then Clubhouse came out and you said, “Okay, let’s just do that.”**\n\nClubhouse undoubtedly encouraged us to focus and move way faster with more urgency. And I think what the Clubhouse team has done is awesome. Every half-decade or so, someone uncovers some new use case or mechanic that changes how people communicate on digital platforms. And I think Clubhouse was really the first to visualize that for what is the audio conversational format. I don’t think these things stay exclusive to one platform. We saw this with ephemeral content. We saw this with live video on Periscope, by the way, right? A year after Periscope launched, every platform had essentially a carbon copy. So I think that this is a natural evolution where there is a company or a startup that usually uncovers some mechanic first and then other platforms think about how to adapt them to their mediums in different ways.\n\n**What is Super Follow?**\n\nSuper Follows is a feature that we’re building, not released yet, that will allow creators or influencers, anyone who has a Twitter account, to be subscribed to by their biggest fans. So rather than just following Alex to get his tweets, you can Super Follow him to get access to a subset of whatever content that Alex might want to publish for just his subscribers.\n\nSo that’s mechanically what it is. The *why* behind this is, for years, people have built followings on Twitter and have had to really leverage other tools and services outside of Twitter to be able to be supported directly by their audience and to provide exclusive content to their subscribers. We’ve seen platforms like Patreon and OnlyFans and many others build these capabilities that fundamentally are just helping creators make money and helping creators have a new type of relationship and back and forth with their biggest fans. And we think it’s a huge opportunity, both for creators and for Twitter to help offer that as a layer within Twitter. Particularly one that allows us to stitch together for creators and influencers, many of the capabilities that we’re adding onto Twitter right now.\n\nSo if you had a super follower capability, Alex, you would be able to publish newsletters using Revue to your super followers, you’d be able to host subscribers in the Spaces, subscriber-only DMs, subscriber-only tweets. Imagine every capability that exists on Twitter right now in terms of how you might create content and share it with the world, but then add to it the ability to narrowcast and target that content to either everyone or just your super followers, and be able to create your own custom definition of what you will provide your super followers, whether that’s the price point that you choose or how much content and what type of content they should expect from you on a periodic basis.\n\n**This one is particularly interesting to me because I did leave *BuzzFeed* to start my own newsletter, *Big Technology*, and of course this podcast. And I tweet a lot. So I’m kind of doing all the things that you guys are getting into. What’s the convincing argument though, for me to leave the services I like and then bring them to a centralized platform and then essentially bet everything on Twitter?**\n\nI’m not sure you need to. Our intent here is not to be winner-takes-all. There will be many platforms that allow creators to be rewarded by their audience. And I think we imagine a world where Twitter can be a part of that ecosystem and actually play quite nicely with that ecosystem. I think that there are specific capabilities within Twitter that we are uniquely well-positioned to provide, like being able to have a conversational layer, a public conversational layer between you and your followers, and your biggest super fans or super followers. That is something that we are uniquely positioned to excel on.\n\nBut I don’t think in order for us to succeed, we don’t need you to stop podcasting and move to use Spaces exclusively. You can create a podcast just like you normally do right now, and then use Twitter as a layer to have either a conversation beforehand. Like, “Hey, what should Kayvon and I talk about.” Like, “Do you want to influence what the agenda of this conversation is going to be super followers?”\n\n**I did just ask that in a tweet right before we got on the line…**\n\nWe’re less thinking of this as a… we need to create the one and only way where people can create the subscriber graph. That’s not how we’re thinking about this. I think it would be foolish for us to be so narrowly centered. We’re going to create the best and only thing rather than how do we build something that uniquely leverages the strengths of Twitter and also can play nicely with the rest of the ecosystem in a way that ultimately helps creators. Our goal here is to incentivize creators, to be able to have more interesting conversations on the platform.\n\n**Yeah. And it is interesting to me, Revue will take 5% of subscriber fees, whereas Substack takes 10%. So I think you will have a convincing argument that you’re going to be able to make to a bunch of people in my position.**\n\nHow do you think about that? What are the pros and cons and the dimensions of that decision for you?\n\n**Twitter is a compelling use case for what I’m trying to do. I think Revue has a lot of work that it needs to do in terms of design. But if you guys get a parity there, and I’m able to bring subscribers into the same experience, I think that would make a lot of sense. In fact, when people unsubscribe from *Big Technology*, I have a little form “Tell me about why you’ve decided to leave.” And people have just said, “well, I’m just going to read your tweets.” So there is a tension. I’d always want to keep a free element, but there’s definitely something intriguing about taking everything that I’m doing and bringing it under one roof, charging one fee, and trying to make this something that potentially has long-term staying power.**\n\nWhat you just touched on this question of how much of… this class of creator we’re talking about.\n\n**The middle class, that’s what I call it. We’re not the big influencers, but there’s enough people paying attention that — I mean, that’s the bet that I’m making with *Big Technology*— that there’s a chance to make a living off of it.**\n\nYeah. I think one of the super interesting questions is like, what subset of my content goes as part of the free layer versus the subscriber-only layer. I think it’s a fascinating one and something that we’re also thinking a lot about. Because there’s podcasting as one medium, there’s long-form newsletter as another medium. And with Super Follows. We’re adding a bunch of other mediums to this where tweets have their own formula of like, “Well, what do I tweet to my super followers versus everyone?” I’m super interested to see how that evolves. Don’t purport to have the right answer, but we want to build the product with the flexibility to let everyone figure out what that formula means to them.\n\n**I’m going to seriously consider migrating. We’ll see where things go when you roll it out, but it is definitely interesting. What strikes me also is that it’s not just paying for tweets. It’s paying for tweets, but also you pay for the stories in the newsletter and you pay for the community with Spaces. And that’s much more compelling than just paying for 280 character missives.**\n\nI definitely agree. I don’t think paying for tweets is the right take. It’s paying for community and paying for a relationship that is different than the relationship that creators already have with their audience. This is a different type of relationship that can take new forms and be a little bit more intimate, just as a natural function of how much smaller the community that will be.\n\n**Totally. Before you guys bought Revue, which is the newsletter platform we’ve talked about, people were saying you were interested in buying Substack. Did you guys try to buy Substack?**\n\nI’ve long admired that team and I met the team a couple of times. I think they’re really awesome. And just like we were talking about with Clubhouse, I think Substack has done a really amazing job of willing this new form… it’s both not new, but also in the way Substack has really grown, they’ve made this a movement.\n\n**But you had acquisition discussions with them.**\n\nI’m not going to comment on M&A, but I can tell you I’ve met that team and really love what they’re doing.\n\n**All right. We’ll read between the lines. Then they said, “We’re not selling to Twitter.” They thought the opportunity was bigger on their own. Now, you and Andrew Chen, the guy who funds Substack and is also funding Clubhouse from Andreessen Horowitz, are kind of head to head.**\n\nI’ve already reached out to Andrew over DMs and complimented him. I think he’s very good at his job. And he is supporting some awesome companies. I definitely admire —\n\n**Obviously, you’re following his roadmap in some ways, which is interesting.**\n\nI wouldn’t quite frame it like that, but I appreciate the observation.\n\n**Okay. I will.**\n\nGo for it.\n\n**What’s interesting about you guys and them is that the Andreessen investments are hostile to journalists, maybe implicitly. Whereas it seems like you guys are working with journalists. How do you think about that?**\n\nJournalists are our customers. That’s one of the most important demographics of people who use Twitter. And so it’s instrumental for us to make sure that we’re building a product that is valuable to journalists, both from a consumption standpoint and particularly in the case of Spaces, like creation, mechanic… I long for the day that journalists as a natural course of their work are able to use a product like Spaces on Twitter to communicate about their research, the pieces they publish, and to talk about what’s happening in the world. I think that that will make Twitter a better ecosystem if journalists, along with many other types of customers, have that capability.\n\nSo it’s just invaluable for us to have folks like you and Kate Conger of the *New York Times* using the product in the early days and helping us shape how it works. And for what it’s worth, I don’t think that… I know Marc Andreessen and a16z has their own views, I think. I don’t see Clubhouse as necessarily being anti journalists either. The product has that same promise. I think how certain people leverage their block list is different than what the product’s intent is.\n\n**I hear you. Maybe I was a little bit overboard on that one. But it certainly is — you set a tone, you set a culture, and that gets reflected.**\n\nYeah. For us, the tone we’re trying to set with Spaces is, we are building in the public and we want to hear from all of our customers and that is inherently messy and chaotic, but it’s so Twitter. We’ve always, at our best, we’ve built in public and we’ve shaped the product through the intent and will have our customers. It’s how the retreat was born, it’s how the app mention was born, it’s how the hashtag was born. What we’re doing with Spaces in that same spirit is obviously developing in public. What’s different about Spaces is we are building very, very quickly. We are taking action in days and weeks. We don’t use the units of time with months and quarters. And we’re trying to build this product really quickly and bring it to our customers.\n\n**I think it can do really good things for journalism. Because unfortunately, journalists have spoken to the public in tweets. And that’s done them a lot of harm because it takes the nuance and the thoughtfulness that’s inherent to the job and strips it out. And when people do see reporters on Spaces having a conversation, it will reveal some of that thoughtfulness that exists in the work. And for journalists, that will be good to hear from people who disagree with them.**\n\nI couldn’t agree with you more. I would just copy, paste everything you said, but that’s true for not just journalists.\n\n**That’s good for everyone. Probably.**\n\nJack, over a year and a half ago, said we’re rethinking the incentives of the service. And what that refers to is exactly this conversation. The mechanics of Twitter have long incentivized a certain type of discourse. And that discourse is way more tuned towards witty quips that can get lots of likes and retweets. And that is useful for some—\n\n**And outrage.**\n\nYeah. Outrage tends to do well sometimes when you’re optimizing for reach. And that has some positive… the mechanics have some positive outcomes, right? Like news can travel very quickly. People can stay informed about things that are happening in the world very quickly. But it has a lot of downsides too. It does not lead to empathetic, thoughtful discourse. Like it’s no wonder why the depth of any conversation on Twitter through tweets doesn’t go particularly deep. It’s really hard to have a substantive back and forth. And that’s a product problem. That’s a mechanics problem.\n\n**I view Spaces as an ice bath. Right after pretty intense practice, you jump in the ice bath and cool off, and maybe Spaces can be like the ice bath of Twitter. Instead of yelling at each other, you go in and talk it out.**\n\nA lot of it’s the medium, audio specifically. And when we first started Periscope, we always used to say we chose live video as a medium for our teleportation goal because live video can build truth and empathy. And the empathy bit is very voice-specific because when you hear someone when you hear the intonation when you hear the emotion behind their voice, it’s a level of empathy you can build with them. That’s very different than seeing an avatar and 140 characters of texts.\n\nAnd I believe that that’s a really big part of what’s gonna make this medium on Twitter change the tone of conversation on the platform. Not to suggest that there isn’t value for asynchronous text-based back and forth, but it’s the compliment of the two together that I think is really fascinating.\n\n**I think they work well together. There’s something inside Substack, they call it the Baschez number. I don’t know if you know about it?**\n\nNo.\n\n**It’s named after Nathan Baschez. He used to work there and he’s now doing his own newsletter. And they basically take the number of Twitter followers that somebody has and they look at their engagement and they can tell pretty well whether they would make a successful newsletter writer or not. And I believe they go try and recruit. This didn’t happen with me. I did this on my own. But they tried to recruit them and say, “Hey, you could make a better living, more stable living if you were just writing a paid newsletter.”**\n\n**So, how do you think that this feature will change modern-day newsrooms? Because superstars who have long gone in and they’ve gotten paid well and felt comfortable may actually be able to make more money doing something like a Revue, Spaces, Super Follow combination. I’m sure people are going to leave the *New York Times*to try this out. So what do you think about that?**\n\nI think we’re already seeing it. The tools that now exist both help the tools that help you build your own audience, the tools that help you publish with minimal investment and a minimal team behind you, and the tools that help you make money to support yourself to continue your craft. It’s never been more rich. And so I think that’s true. By the way, broadly, well beyond long-form publishing, like this is the best time for an entrepreneur to start a company and go build some new technology-based products on AWS and you don’t need to hire a 30 person infrastructure team to go build some tools.\n\n**Never been cheaper to start a company.**\n\nIt’s never been cheaper.\n\n**And you’ve never been able to do it as quickly.**\n\nAnd you’ve never been able to reach an audience as quickly. Helpful in part due to platforms like Twitter and IG and all the other platforms that help you get distribution. So I think that we’re absolutely going to continue seeing this across all verticals, not just journalism. And I think it will be interesting to see how traditional publishers evolve and how the platforms like Twitter evolve and how this burgeoning ecosystem of tools evolve around it.\n\n**What other use cases do you see?**\n\nWith what?\n\n**The Super Follow. When you say it’s not just journalism, what are you thinking of in your mind?**\n\nSuper Follows is not going to displace an existing type of conversation that’s going to move from public to private subscriber-only. It’s going to create a new avenue for conversation that isn’t happening right now. There’s this funny back and forth where someone tweeted… I don’t remember who it was, but someone tweeted like what would this person need to tweet for you to… which of these tweets would you be willing to pay for or something. And Scott Belsky, who’s an old friend and one of the first investors of Periscope had this great response. He replied with, “You’re super following them for the things that they don’t tweet.” Which I think is so spot on.\n\n**Oh, fascinating.**\n\nI think this layer, if done correctly, will allow a new type of relationship and a new type of conversation to flourish between creators and their audience that doesn’t really flourish today on Twitter at least. And maybe it flourishes through other mediums.\n\n**Well, now I got to ask the OnlyFans question. Do you see this as competitive with OnlyFans?**\n\nI think there are certain use cases that I would hope people would choose Super Follows for rather than OnlyFans, but I think OnlyFans will continue to exist. I mean, they have also a particular demographic of usage that we’re not shooting for on Twitter. But I think any time a capability like this gets built at a bigger platform, there are certain use cases that it competes for and there are certain use cases that it doesn’t compete for. So I think time will tell.\n\nBut we’re not really thinking of this through the lens of, “Hey, let’s go after OnlyFans and Patreon.” We think of this from a first principle standpoint. Like how do we build a product that allows creators on Twitter to get more value out of Twitter and be able to develop a new type of relationship with their audience? And it just so happens that that will intersect with some use cases that other third-party tools fulfill today. And in some cases, will allow for use cases that aren’t fulfilled by any tool.\n\n**Yeah. I like that. It’s the stuff that people aren’t saying out loud, but might say to a small select group of people who are willing to pay and be part of a private community. That’s really interesting.**\n\n**Okay, at your Analyst Day, you said you’re going to add or you expect to add 123 million users in the next two years. You only have about in the 200 million range now. Why does Twitter set such high expectations? It seems like this is what happened with the IPO. And then it took years to dig out of the gulf between the expectations and reality. Isn’t this just creating a similar situation?**\n\nI can’t speak to the IPO and what decision-making went into expectations setting then. I can tell you that… well, a couple of things. One, I would actually argue that people have low expectations of Twitter. Over the last five years, I think people have had insanely low expectations.\n\n**No doubt. Right. But you’re ramping them up again.**\n\nYeah. And I think rightfully so for a couple of reasons. One, these are our expectations and I think there’s a power to being transparent about your own expectations because it is yet another way that you can be held to account, right? It’s one thing to have your own intrinsic motivation to do something, but when you put it on the public record, it really puts a fire under you. And I think that’s terrifying, but it’s a good quality to instill in a team. So I think that’s one of the benefits.\n\nThe other, and I suspect this is somewhat different to Twitter of yesteryear is, we’re not making shit up. This is our strategy. We have goals around that strategy that we want to hold ourselves accountable to. And we’re not pulling things out of a hat. This is a strategy that… we didn’t publish this last night or a week ago. We’ve been focused on this strategy for quite some time. We have some momentum under our belt and we’re intent on seeing it through. Sorry if you’re hearing my dog’s barking in the background.\n\n**That’s okay. We always have dogs in this work-from-home podcast era. Dog’s up here on every show.**\n\nMillie. Millie, come here. Millie…\n\n[Editors note: Millie does not come to Kayvon.]\n\nOkay, so to me, it’s both important for the world to know where Twitter is going because we are building a public conversation platform. It would be ironic if we were not public about our own strategy and ambitions. I think it is uniquely Twitter to be leaned in and transparent about the work that we’re doing. So I don’t see it as a distraction. I think it’s an added layer of complexity, which I think is a feature. Not a complexity, it’s an added layer of accountability, which to me is a feature, not a bug. And we’re going to try really hard to not let ourselves and our customers and our shareholders down.\n\n**The last question I was going to ask you is how did Jack show up at the beginning of your Analyst Day in a sweatshirt and what looked like a yoga lodge, and then end up with a hunter hat in some other location later in the day. He’s a man of mystery.**\n\nI lost power for the entirety of Analyst Day, which is the worst possible time for the utility company to ruin the neighborhood’s power. So I actually wasn’t able to watch our videos. I didn’t see the transformation, but I will say, I think Jack has earned the right to wear whatever the fuck he wants.\n\n**Okay. Well, we’ll end it with that. That was a good exclamation point for a really interesting conversation. Kayvon, I appreciate you joining.**\n\n[The Story Behind Twitter’s Revival: A Conversation With Twitter Product Head Kayvon Beykpour](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec) #archive",

By that, I mean... It is as unimaginably capable as I would have imagined.\n\n![](iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20(Working%20Draft)\/Ep06W6A9.jpg)The Original\n\nThese past weeks, I have indulged myself thoroughly in the company of this long-dormant *Handset Enthusiast* part of me - this dork who seems to be infinitely enchanted by conversations vaguely about innovation in a business which seemed almost inevitably alienating of anyone who didn't care enough about some unexotic discussion in the tech community to a demonstrably obsessive degree. Again, the experience has screamed over and over again that I am extremely vulnerable to high computing capability. In other words, the more a computer can do, the more I want to see what I can do *with* it. For a very long time, iPhone OS' locked downness actually helped me tremendously in this regard.\n\nabout the tools we use to make things: how we learned to make them, how we learned to learn to use them, and how we learned to teach others - identifying it *truly* and meditating\n\ninto a hypothetical future which\n\n![](iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20(Working%20Draft)\/aln4F1N2.png)iPhone 12 Pro Max Physical Controls Diagram\n\nit is a guarantee that no matter where I may go or who I may find myself unwittingly surrounded by, the option to escape into my own Computing World *in its entirety* and more - not just an abbreviated, **Mobile** facsimile - shall from now on and forever be with me, there against my right asscheek, just a grab and a glance away. Like The Holy Spirit was it pledged and prepared to stay by my side.\n\ndown to a depth of six feetYa know, I'm actually astonished by how much of this ritual *hasn't* changed.\n\n#iP12PM",

    "content" : "# Twitter is building Spaces to amplify already-deafening voices\nThe first for the space I stumbled upon was hosted by Matt Daniels who I'm assuming that I discovered on periscope because he was quite prolific there and he said something profound about Twitter spaces when I asked how do you know how his foot are going to prevent poor space is going away a Periscope which regardless of any of the actual use implications as a business it has failed him and elected butter and he said the big difference between spaces in Periscope is the lack of text chat and he said that his experience on periscope was that it was a text chat and people in the text chat saying shit That was the downfall of periscope and so the crucial exclusion the answer feature of Twitter spaces is the lack of texture now I also join space most recently that had a bunch of young cool people in it that's what are celebrities were just popular younger Twitter users he was certain it was around a K-pop band but no I'm sorry not care about the CPAP and they just released an album they were talking about anyway And they were like these they said a lot of things I recorded that were interesting about spaces and when they did come up was you know I really wish it was text chat here's the big problem that I that I've got to surface for you a lot of people on the Internet how many people the amount of people that I know on the Internet who are uncomfortable coming in voice chat but have lots of valuable things to say texture is a mess now I think that like we've vaguely lamented the \"anonymity the Internet allows because yes it has Well arguably enabled trolls to say awful shit etc. but the original promise the Internet with the people who were uncomfortable being identified by name could have control over their identity and that control I think I can say without question has a Lotta Lotta voices that we wouldn't have otherwise heard to speak for a quote Thanks for text I know this I know that there are a lot of people are important people who are uncomfortable coming in voice chat because I ran a podcast that you might say it was about Internet culture for a year dry cast back in 2015 and I mean a lot of the people that I wanted to speak to you just didn't want their voices to be revealed it might be a question of an identity might not be A lot of people I know on Twitter are trans and well just like that we were actually there is no merit and deconstructing whether or not someone is justified in being uncomfortable but if we were I think that's a pretty good argument right and Twitter spaces apparently not original space with Matt Mike Elgin was also in there and I I can't directly quiet so I'm actually not sure who it was but someone say that they've been in space recently with water developers who had specifically explicitly said yes Twitter spaces was designed Without text chat so that people felt safe there and I can understand that but I would comment I did just the one that's going to like it's going to end up to the spaces with the same people who already have an audience and already have therefore access to many ways of engaging with their audience It's it's it's just for them it's for the people who are totally cool with sharing with people people who is giving them tools to moderate and like I'm not this is expected right this is a rational business decision by sweater but that's all it is and I've been running about this and in the course of it in or going and looking at Twitter is about page which has a big head that says we serve the public conversation and I was like it first ha ha well but then they do the issue is how you define public conversation I think Twitter originally Naïvely perhaps if anyone who you are defined the public conversation as serving it the betterment of it would involve is this thing as a platform for those who wouldn't otherwise be heard from her but now the public conversation I think it's for us to find it is referring to what's happening and what's happening suggests a lot of people like what's what's on the lines of of of a lot of people together not you know what are some original thoughts that someone might have that that wouldn't otherwise be heard and the problem one last thing the issue was going down that avenue of arguing that Business decisions like that on social networks punish the minority is that a lot of people with very foul views feel like they dominate minority and the truth of keeping them from from being violent to people while they ultimately basically that is silencing them know that's and it was just makes them feel like they're in the minority more but personally the person that people really suffer here are the people who do you have edgy that exactly is it that you have genuinely original things to say that aren't hateful because that's just a very small portion of anything and it's not a result it's not original to be edgy but yeah I'm writing about it I would I would like to hear from anyone Who is not good for being heard from a voice what your thoughts might be on this oh yeah I guess the last thing I'll say I am expecting Twitter to genuinely seek out and uplift silence voices is something that I have I've not been burned with the expectation of Twitter Inc. doing anything positive for years so I guess it's a privilege Twitter spaces\n\n#transcription",

It is necessary, though. I know now that I would never be satisfied by delegating the task to anyone else.\n\nI have also made virtually zero progress on *Drywall's Written History*, but I'm technically only halfway through the week-long period I gave myself to cough it up.\n\nIn *Eve*, I experienced my first *real* big fleet fight in Saranen. I use such language because the time-dialaton system was triggered to bring the passage of game time down to 10%, which is so ridiculously tedious that I was able (or, required, I suppose) to take an AFK smoke break *during* the fight. We were all anchored on Rocky Aivoras, burning away from the mostly-Megathron BS fleet the Goons deployed.\n\nAlso of note: this was my first time undocking the coalition doctrine Cerberus fit, which I named *Michmethah, the Gift of a Striker*.\n\nAstonishingly, our fleet didn't lose a *single* vessel in Saranen, and our coalition only lost ~25 billion ISK as opposed to The Imperium's 100 billion.\n#juegos",

And realizing just how much of my adult social activity was based around drinking. I’m so glad you’ve gotten to experience Saab life! And I hope you are thriving, of course. As for driving any automobile, it’s going to be at least until April, but if you can bear my company (I think I’ve changed quite a bit as a person since we talked last,) you should come see my old COMPAQ portable from the 80s sometime... It’s about the only interesting thing I’ve got left lol.\n#correspondence"

The depth to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar valuation. Dozens of media companies –  [CultofMac](https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/) ,  [MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/) ,  [Macworld](https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/) ,  [9to5 Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/) ,  [AppleInsider](https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/) ,  [iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/) , and... more – exist solely to cover one single independent company: Apple, Incorporated. One wonders how the sum total of the individuals involved with and these organizations compares with the total number of employees working for the company their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely centered around. (Further interesting questions: are there any comparable situations anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not – doesn't this sort of attention constitute some kind of Monopoly, even if it was not necessarily an anti-competitive one?) For “reasonable people,” the image one conjures up of The All-The-Time Apple Beat does not lend to envy, but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most casual forms of speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate time in my childhood development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt branded with a stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real live public Junior High school. There are few more embarrassing admissions, except perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It's the addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in its democratization. Billionaires are running the same operating system and much of the same software as I am every day – even the most followed person on any given platform is still accessing it through the same interface I might be. These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous lack of competition in a product category that has become more essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just three or four blinks of an eye.  \n\n#iP12PM",

    "content" : "# The internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on Instagram | Document Journal\n![](The%20internet%20didn%E2%80%99t%20kill%20counterculture%E2%80%94you%20just%20won%E2%80%99t%20find%20it%20on%20Instagram%20%7C%20Document%20Journal\/IC_THUMB_VERTICAL.jpg)\n“To be truly countercultural in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.”\n\nSearch Google Images for ‘counterculture’ and it overwhelmingly returns black-and-white photos of young people all now over 60. In the pictures, it is so clear what they were countering: The Man, of course, who, with his white collar, white skin, and short hair, singlehandedly symbolized dominant cultural norms. In the age of social media, personal expression has become the most valuable form of currency, yet we still use the term ‘counterculture’ to describe alternatives to the hegemonic forces of yesteryear, as if dressing middle-class, white, and preppy still aligned with the rules of power today.\n\nIn an era more profoundly organized by Big Tech than our own elected governments, the new culture to be countered isn’t singular or top-down. It’s rhizomatic, nonbinary, and includes all who live within the Google\/Apple\/Facebook\/ Amazon digital ecosystem (aka GAFA stack). With digital platforms transforming legacy countercultural activity into profitable, high-engagement content, being countercultural no longer means being counter-hegemonic. What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths, gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and political conflict of its users?\n\nAs recently as the early ’90s, abjection and extreme profanity still worked pretty well to repel the big social threats of the time: pearl-clutching conservatives with their anti-progressive ideology and market recuperation. Take, for instance, musician GG Allin in an American-flag loincloth, fighting with his audience and shitting on stage before launching into a performance of “I’m Gonna Rape You,” or artist and noise musician Boyd Rice, in what he reports was a prank, joining the founder of the white supremacist group American Front in a 1989 Sassy photo shoot for an article the teen magazine was running on neo-Nazis. In context, these artists (like the psychedelic hippies of yore) were being literally countercultural—using culture against itself to violate the hegemonic push toward, in Allin’s and Rice’s case, neoliberal “responsibilization.”\n\nIn today’s online space, however, this strategy breaks down. Brought back into the spotlight in 2018 via a NYC gallery exhibition of visually innocuous abstract paintings, Rice quickly found himself at the center of controversy as his decades-old Sassy appearance (among other such stunts) tripped present-day censors. An old punk, he smirked at the outrage. “I’m too dangerous for New York City,” he told [Artnet](https:\/\/news.artnet.com\/exhibitions\/boyd-rice-greenspon-show-canceled-1346441). Yet he wasn’t too dangerous for the internet. High-tension discussion of his work and life and the gallerist’s moral compass raged online, which is to say Rice was attentionally successful online. Despite being informed by billions, this new technological hegemony isn’t democratic; it’s a swarm-led form of para-governance programmed to maximize engagement while obfuscating responsibility for the social and environmental damage it wreaks. Zuckerberg, Bezos, Thiel, and other tech behemoths are quick to remind us that they’re not in charge of public laws or policy; their empires were built according to the “peaceful mechanisms” of free-market capitalism—and that society has adopted their tools and spaces through its own free will. If pressed, they’ll point out how their platforms reflect the countercultural demands of earlier generations: eschewing big government and vertical corporate culture while encouraging personal fulfillment and flat organizational structures. Today you can be a coder and a DJ, an Uber driver and a travel blogger, a Sand Hill Road suit and a Robot Heart Burner.\n\n> What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths, gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and political conflict of its users?  \n\nSimilarly slippery is the new look of power. Far from the parades, palaces, and outsize girths of present-day strongmen like Viktor Orbán, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump, the most iconic tells you’ll find among the big tech set are more likely to be a black turtleneck, a Patagonia fleece, and the absence of carrying bags. It’s a flex to be visually indistinguishable from the crowd. The power of today is firmly situated in minimalism, restraint, and ease—it’s only power under threat that turns to physical displays of strength. Actual power is controlling the means by which lesser power can be displayed—i.e., congrats on the 500K likes on your polling numbers, @jack still owns all your tweets. Actual power keeps a low profile; actual power doesn’t need a social media presence, it owns social media.\n\nIn recent years, users have started to register this shift. Yet the term counterculture still gets used to describe someone like rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, whose notoriety—first breaking society’s code (sexual abuse and murder conspiracy, among other offenses) and then the omertà code of the streets (snitching on fellow gang members to lessen his own sentence)—propelled him to superstardom: “ [Gooba](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pPw_izFr5PA),” a track he surprise-dropped upon being surprise-released from prison, made YouTube history by becoming the most-watched rap video in a 24-hour span, frying the platform’s view counter. That same day, 2 million simultaneous users tuned in to his Instagram Live as he confessed into his phone camera: “I snitched, I ratted. But who was I supposed to be loyal to?” And then with a sparkle of VVS diamonds, “I broke the YouTube. I’m at 5 million views in one hour. […] A rat is doin’ more numbers than you. Numbers don’t lie.” But behind 6ix9ine’s self-loyalty is an unwitting loyalty to the platform and, by extension, to the shareholders of Alphabet and Facebook, Inc. And this is where it gets tricky. To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.\n\n> To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.  \n\n6ix9ine is subcultural, but he isn’t countercultural. Someone like Edward Snowden, by comparison, isn’t subcultural but may be the closest we get to a countercultural figure in the postdigital age. A US government subcontractor with access to classified intelligence, Snowden saw Big Tech’s radically scaling power and, in 2013, exposed the NSA’s illegal agreements with major tech platforms to intercept the private e-mail, call records, and cache of “almost anything done on the internet” by users worldwide. Snowden’s whistleblowing targeted a major chakra of the new hegemony, resulting in great personal compromise. But a single individual isn’t an entire counterculture.\n\nCounterculture requires a group. Us against the world. And the internet is excellent at bringing groups together around collective dissent. But just like the internet, there is nothing inherently socially progressive about these tools. Extinction Rebellion is countercultural in spirit but so too are QAnon, the armed right-wing libertarian Boogaloo Boys, and Europe’s Reichsbürger, who deny the existence of present-day Germany, claiming to be citizens of the Third Reich (which, they argue, technically never ended).\n\nA truth specific to our time is that dissent against one level of authority is now very often driven by a deeper hegemonic force. Perhaps this is why, among many younger people (Greta Thunberg notwithstanding), there is less focus on battling current leaders and more interest in divining counter-futures. Instead of attempting to dismantle the master’s house using the master’s tools, it’s more something like: Let’s pool crypto to book the master’s Airbnb and use the tools we find there to forge a forest utopia that the master could never survive. Central to this counter-future crafting is a strong belief in impending ecological collapse, rendering all the existing systems of control obsolete—which is a logical work-around for thinking about dissent in a time when the socially and ecologically corrosive systems are deemed too sprawling to effectively counter or boycott. Another key factor is Gen Z’s rediscovery of [PoliticalCompass.org](https:\/\/politicalcompass.org\/), a Web 1.0 site that, via six sets of prompts with which a user is asked to dis\/-identify, generates an approximate position on the Political Compass’s X\/Y axis of Left to Right, Authoritarian to Libertarian.\n\nHaving spent the past several years intensively studying the development of Gen Z’s online political expression, artist Joshua Citarella points to the emergence of “e-deologies, radical politics as a form of niche personal branding.” In his 2019 report *20 Interviews*, Citarella underscores the influence of Political Compass and gaming more generally on ideations of countercultural participation—or what he refers to as a “choose your character \/ choose your future” mode of “identity play that gained heightened relevance as American politics subsumed all of pop culture” during the mid-2010s.\n\nAmong the political identities one finds in this space is, for example: “Ted was right” anarcho-primitivism (anprim), which, following Ted Kaczynski’s *Industrial Society and Its Future* manifesto, promotes a reactionary return to pre-agrarian times where people, reskilled as hunters and gatherers, are no longer alienated from their labor and seek fulfillment through daily survival. If you think this sounds fringe, consider the 10.3 million users currently subscribed to the [Primitive Technology](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA) channel on YouTube, which has tutorialized building things “in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials, […] seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology”—except, of course, the device you use to stream the video showing you how.\n\n![](The%20internet%20didn%E2%80%99t%20kill%20counterculture%E2%80%94you%20just%20won%E2%80%99t%20find%20it%20on%20Instagram%20%7C%20Document%20Journal\/DJ_Sebastian-Lager-2.jpg)\n\nThe names of these e-deologies tend to be both fantastical and literal. A “post-civilizationist” might focus on what optimal human survival would look like were civilization no longer possible. A “voluntarist post-agrarianist,” meanwhile, might value anarcho-primitivism skills but see them as integral to realizing a civilization sustained through opt-in agrarian communes. Elsewhere on the compass, one finds the likes of “Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism” (where a total embrace of technology delivers humanity from scarcity, ecological volatility, and the reactionary social ills of resource competition) and the defiantly neo-traditionalist “technocratic theocracy,” which puts its faith in a machine-governed future that upholds Christian virtues. E-deologies are further explored on message boards and social media via memes, TikTok posts, and livestreamed Twitch and YouTube debates, all of which can get pretty gnarly (calls for “eco-fash global genocide” and “secession of white ethnostates,” etc.) And maybe here, we do have an aesthetic counter to the wallflower non-style of Big Tech: a raging messy semiotic meltdown of radicalizing (if absurdist) meme culture where the only ideological no-go zone is the liberal center. Key here is that most of this activity is happening under the guise of avatars, pseudonyms, and collectively run social media accounts where direct lines between IRL subjects and online personas are rarely clear. The “niche personal branding” is gamified—push an account to the extreme, see what happens. If the platform shuts you down, start over.\n\nWhile climate change is a shared concern for many younger people, their responses might be more accurately understood as competitive-futurist than countercultural. As the greatly imaginative range of Political Compass positions illustrates, there is little consensus over who or what they are specifically opposing. This is wise in an era when the complexity of global crises makes it exceedingly difficult to effectively isolate responsible parties. How would one even begin to hold, say, Apple accountable for all of the externalities within the life of an iPhone? Who among us could easily give up our connectivity and still be economically and socially okay? It’s as if, having grown up on a fully networked Earth, Gen Z has bypassed counterculture, finding it futile in the face of a hegemonic system that more clearly resembles a Hydra than the monolithic forces that legacy counterculture was rebelling against. Intuiting that any activity directly opposing the system will only make the system stronger, the next generation is instead opting for radical hyperstition: constructing alternative futures that abandon our current infrastructure entirely (the emergence of blockchain-based currencies, for instance, or calls to not merely reform but fully abolish the police).\n\nWhile Citarella’s research focuses on teenagers who began posting online around 2016 (and in 2020 are roughly 18 years old), it nevertheless distills the changing nature of contemporary countercultural activity more broadly. For one, anonymity, or at least pseudonymity, is increasingly important if not fundamental to being active online in counter-hegemonic ways. This is very different from, say, 1990s ideations of IRL counterculture, where there was a premium on unmediated authenticity and “being real” (think MTV Unplugged). Now “selling out” is tying your online identity to your IRL life and real name. In part, this is because one of the biggest impediments to countercultural activity is the fact that the internet doesn’t suppress expression—it forces you to express and then holds you accountable for whatever you say for years. On the platform, silence isn’t an option, at least not if you want the network to remember you exist. This is especially true in the culture sector, where being visible means being kept in mind for gigs and collaborations. There is a reason why 6ix9ine is obsessed with breaking YouTube and why talented young rappers must be equally talented at social media marketing if they ever hope to build a career.\n\n> It’s as if, having grown up on a fully networked Earth, Gen Z has bypassed counterculture, finding it futile in the face of a hegemonic system that more clearly resembles a Hydra than the monolithic forces that legacy counterculture was rebelling against.  \n\nWe saw this dynamic metastasize in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, when well-intentioned claims of “silence is violence” (recalling the powerful 1987 ACT-UP “Silence = Death” campaign) spiraled into calling out individuals with even a small following who hadn’t come forward with a timely public statement of solidarity or remorse. Yet public posts were subject to popular scrutiny and judged based on sincerity, originality, and tone. Not surprisingly, many people defaulted to posting a somber plain black square. But this generated criticism of its own by clogging the feed with an informational blackout during a moment when community resource sharing was critically important. Amid a chaotic time, the platform functioned exactly as designed: amplification of emotions, uptick in user interaction, growth in platform engagement and data cultivation. *Cha-ching*, the platform cashes in. What’s really messed up about this is that users, despite understanding that the platform’s mechanics are net-bad, still feel a moral responsibility to obey the platform-enabled-hive-mind’s rules.\n\nOn the dark edges of the early internet, hackers foresaw the enclosure of the public commons long before the likes of 6ix9ine, Snowden, and teenage Gen Z. These users developed an ethos that valued the radical freedom of a fully anonymous, hyperconnected zone where people could communicate unburdened by their physical bodies and government names. As online activity began to centralize around search engines, such as Netscape, Explorer, and Google, in the late-’90s and early-’00s, the internet bifurcated into what became known as the “clearnet,” which includes all publicly indexed sites (i.e., big social media, commercial platforms, and anything crawled by major search engines) and the “darknet” or “deep web,” which is not publicly indexed (due to being built on anonymized, encrypted networks such as Tor). There were also a number of sites that though officially clearnet, laid the groundwork for a sub-clearnet space that we might think of as a “dark forest” zone—particularly message board forums like Reddit and 4chan, where users can interact without revealing their IRL identity or have this activity impact their real-name SEO.\n\nTaken from the title of Chinese sci-fi writer Liu Cixin’s 2008 book, “the dark forest” region of the web is becoming increasingly important as a space of online communication for users of all ages and political persuasions. In part, this is because it is less sociologically stressful than the clearnet zone, where one is subject to peer, employer, and state exposure. It also now includes Discord servers, paid newsletters (e.g., Substack), encrypted group messaging (via Telegram, etc.), gaming communities, podcasts, and other off-clearnet message board forums and social media. One forages for content or shares in what others in the community have retrieved rather than accepting whatever the platform algorithms happen to match to your data profile. Additionally, dark forest spaces are both minimally and straightforwardly commercial. There is typically a small charge for entry, but once you are in, you are free to act and speak without the platform nudging your behavior or extracting further value. It is also interesting to keep in mind that the dark forest shares the same cables and satellite arrays as clearnet channels, is accessed via the same devices, and essentially all of its denizens continue to simultaneously participate in clearnet spaces (as contemporary professional protocol demands). It is therefore not analogous to legacy countercultural notions of going off-grid or “dropping out.”\n\nTo be sure, none of these spaces are pure, and users are just as vulnerable to echo chambers and radicalization in the dark forest as on pop-stack social media. But in terms of engendering more or less counter-hegemonic potential, the dark forest is more promising because of its relative autonomy from clearnet physics (the gravity, velocity, and traction of content when subject to x algorithm). Unlike influencers and “blue checks,” who rely on clearnet recognition for income, status, and even self-worth, dark forest dwellers build their primary communities out of clearnet range—or offline in actual forests, parks, and gardens (e.g., cottagecore and related eco-social trends)—and then only very selectively or even absurdly\/incoherently show themselves under clearnet light. The crux of Liu Cixin’s book is the creed, when called by the clearnet: “Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!! But if you do answer, the source will be located right away. Your planet will be invaded. Your world will be conquered.”\n\nSo what does today’s counter-hegemonic culture look like? It’s not particularly interested in being seen—at least not in person. It gets no thrill out of wearing leather and a mohawk and walking past main-street shops, which are empty now anyway. But it does demonstrate a hunger for freedom—freedom from the attention economy, from atomization, and the extractive logic of mainstream communication. We can imagine collectively held physical spaces reclaimed from empty retail or abandoned venues hosting esoteric local scenes, a proliferation of digital gangs in dark forests who hold secrets dear, and a new desire for scarcity in cultural objects—deeper and closer connections made between people even while rejecting the platform’s compulsion to “like and share.” In the internet era, true counterculture is difficult to see, and even harder to find—but that doesn’t mean it’s not there.\n\n[The internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on Instagram](https:\/\/www.documentjournal.com\/2021\/01\/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram\/) #archive",

The answer is not obvious,\" notes Kirschenbaum in his Preface. I believe those interested in either should consider it **required reading**.\n\nTo those like myself who are particularly interested in word processors and their history, I say **buy this book immediately** as a given. I can't remember the last time I was so elated to have found such a book, largely out of relief, for I was beginning to think I would have to write it myself.\n\nThe volume of published reviews of this book - and the diversity of the publications that carried them - will surprise you. I set out to gather them all in one space, and found the task quite huge.\n\nThere *is* some drudgery, yes - extensive details on IBM's interworkings in the 1970s, perhaps - but Kirschenbaum does an excellent job at being thorough without inappropriate tedium.

    "content" : "I just sent the following email to Meagan.\n\nMeagan,\n\nPlease forgive me if my attempts to contact you illicit distress. I understand if you don't have the room in your life right now, but I'd really love to talk with you. Perhaps we could over coffee sometime? Or text, even.\n\nIn retrospect, the messages I've sent have been as pitiful as my father's one-way conversations with me over the years. If you feel the same about me as I do about him, I can understand why a response doesn't seem like a productive use of your time. To be honest, I'm not sure you have anything to gain from me.\n\nI also have to confess that I miss you as much as I did a year ago. I haven't been able to go a day without thinking about you. I don't expect it's been the same for you, but that's okay. I've had a lot of time to arrive at peace with it. If anything, I now take joy in the image of you continuing in your life in happiness.\n\nIf you're still reading, I'm assuming you're curious enough to wonder why I'm contacting you again.\n\nI know you well enough to know this language is probably really strange\/crazy to you, but you know me well enough to know that it's true.\n\nSince I last saw you, I've done a lot, and met a lot of people, and I do not exaggerate when I say that I've found them all intolerable in comparison to you and your family. I had no idea how precious rationality was, I suppose. I miss Erin & Adam and even your mom tremendously. I'm not sure if they influenced my preferences or if I was just too young to understand them, but I do.\n\nSeveral months ago, I realized that if I knew I was going to die in an hour, I would spend it making every effort to say I love you again.\n\nIsn't that strange? Like... It's not like I've never told you. Yet I am certain of it.\n\nOf course, I thought I was crazy, but that would've been too easy. Unfortunately, I think it's because I love you. You are still my favorite collection of molecules by far.\n\nI've gotten us into quite a mess.\n\nIn reflection, some of the things I said to you absolutely abhor me, and the thought of all the ridiculous pressures and stresses I put you through brings me to tears.\n\nI also know that my love probably has little worth to you in and of itself. And I don't mean that in passive-aggressive self-pity... I mean it literally and frankly.\n\nWhat is self-pitiful, probably, is that all my experiences have done is prove again and again that you are still what's important to me. I don't think it's in a relationship sense, necessarily, but I can't be certain at this point. I do know that is it I that owe you, not vice versa. A whole ocean of apologies, if nothing else.\n\nI know it's slimey to circumvent your blocks... I hope I don't really disgust you that much. I don't want to bother you, but the thought of never speaking to you again is my only remaining fear in life, and it scares me to death.\nDavid Blue\n\n#legacy",

    "content" : "# Profound Revelations in iOS 12 — The Psalms\n![](Profound%20Revelations%20in%20iOS%2012%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Psalms\/ShVoCP3.png)\nBack in 2016, *Pokémon Go*, overclocked Apple Watches, pissing wearables, and What You See is What You Get blogging services all claimed unprecedented casualties among consumers according to *Futureland*'s iOS 10 episode, which we did our absolute best to dramatize in order to survive what was expected to be the dullest event on record. We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos and the mysterious nature of “Live Blogging” as an occupation. [AirPods were introduced](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/12\/20\/14016568\/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review) and subsequently shit on, and the [comparatively archaic](https:\/\/bilge.world\/mono-audio-playback) 3.5mm analog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got over “forgetting” about Live Photos because it's rapidly becoming difficult to keep stuff *on* the phone now. *I* am coming sincerely close to believing none of this is real, anyway. Today, though, it’s a damned straight ballgame, isn’t it? Months have passed since Apple pushed out its major mobile OS release of the year to [more little rectangular computers](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/1\/26\/10835748\/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios) than any one person could speedcount in a lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me dozens of [videos about the next one](https:\/\/youtu.be\/CXKqCWWjxSM). At this point, you and I are already aware of the iOS development community, who has already been using Internet Operating System 12 on their personal devices for more than half a year by the time your irises are landing here. Hopefully, all but two or three stranded, dying explorers in the arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn’t they?\n\nOur expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those we’d need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases ago, when one’s phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch itself tight to the stability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy, destined metamorphosis. Sometimes, backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables took hours, after which the custodian may or may not find their companion’s replication had completed successfully. If it had, one had to be sure to close any applications apart from iTunes to provide a working environment of utter silence – restarting after finishing the download was my own preferred method – before entrusting the despicably unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes frantically rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it wasn’t uncommon for an update to inexplicably fail, “bricking” the subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole steps in the wrong direction and restore it from the entire backup they’d just created (hopefully) in order to… make another, precisely-identical attempt, for lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the user planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before bed, when even those holding the second-newest product in the lineage would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, web page loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and tossing their device toward the darkness.\n\n> Something is amiss with ipad  \n\n> — Cher (@cher) [December 10, 2012](https:\/\/twitter.com\/cher\/status\/278053444135288833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \n\nThese days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more powerful than my laptop at the moment, and my new friends’ WiFi connection is better than what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven’t needed to physically back it up more than once or twice since I bought it — iCloud stores the lot for $4.99­ a month anyway. I blinked once watching *Riki-Oh* with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden, a 1.6GB download isn’t really a big deal. Siddown and watch your Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and *hey*! You’re ready to update! Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which **I am the obvious bottleneck** and my 100 words per minute on a smartphone keyboard, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now **waiting on me** when it updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned holdup.\n\nSo, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this “Review” of a free software update that’s in no way optional (waiting a month is no longer a rational minimization of risk — it’s just dumb,) not any more difficult to attain than the bills currently waiting in your mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of mobile operating systems to compete with any cross-platform alternatives? For myself, it’s proved [a gratifying tradition of sorts](http:\/\/bilge.world\/ios-10-review-speed\/) and a good use of my apparently-abundant time if only for the record's sake (hello, future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,) but this release – assuming I haven’t overlooked something – is the most globe-shucking of all because of one single featureset: **Siri Shortcuts**. However, the vast majority of the intra-Apple press' coverage of this release has come across nearly as unconcerned with them as I was originally. Take [Macworld's iOS 12 Review](https:\/\/www.macworld.co.uk\/review\/ios-apps\/ios-12-3683670\/), for instance: it was the first result in my Google search for “iOS 12 review,” yet Siri Shortcuts are only mentioned in the bottom quarter of its first page. When I recorded the “ [iOS 12 Review](https:\/\/radiopublic.com\/end-user-WdbezM\/ep\/s1!ba096) ” episode of my “ [podcast](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue),” I spoke as if I was somehow the only person on the planet who comprehends the profound implications of this software addition – which was, of course, more of [an absorbent acquisition](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/22\/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone\/) – but I have since discovered one gem, at least, which has continued the conversation in a most superb manner. It's [a technology podcast called Supercomputer](https:\/\/supercomputer.transistor.fm\/about), and it's hosted by [Alex Cox](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlexCox) and [Matthew Cassinelli](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlexCox) – the latter of whom developed a significant amount of the iOS app [Workflow](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/16\/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a-computing-platform\/) (and wrote most or all of its documentation, [apparently](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue),) which Apple assimilated as Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely knowledgeable and competent commentators on – as far as I can hear, at least – virtually **the entire iOS *lifestyle** *. (For those on the outside who've never stepped in: laugh if you must, but yes it *is* a lifestyle, still, and it's new thought leader [isn't exactly coming up short](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/12\/3\/18124416\/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl) these days.) iOS is technically *software*, yes, but it leaves an intractable itch for some greater, transcendent term.\n\nIn just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this feature, I was able to create a Shortcut which sends any given handset's IP address and precise GPS location (among other mundane metrics) in a text message **to my phone number**. I could share this shortcut among my other submissions to [Sharecuts](https:\/\/sharecuts.app\/) or [ShortcutsGallery.com](https:\/\/shortcutsgallery.com\/), where any iOS user could download and subsequently send this information back to *my* phone. (Don't believe me? [Have a go at it yourself](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481) and I'll send back a screenshot if you'd like.) I accomplished this without any particular skills or education in software development or cybersecurity – without any real *malice*, even – I was just playing around. As far as my recollection goes, Apple has *never* included such a powerful, potentially-dangerous piece of software in a standard software update before. It's both absolutely brilliant and sortof a ripoff to be so entrusted for the first time. In many ways – like my Disable Bluetooth & WiFi shortcut – Siri Shortcuts represent an awfully half-assed solution to some of the most basic, longtime incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it's great that I can just make myself a shortcut to completely disable my phone's WiFi and Bluetooth activity with one press or Siri command (combining “type to Siri” with Siri Shortcuts basically enables a form of Command Line functionality in iOS,) but frankly, one should've expected the world's largest company to *do it themselves* in perhaps the second of third version of this operating system instead of saying *okay, here are the tools – you do it!* in its *twelfth*.\n\nI've found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid discussing the *other* literature available on the subject at any given time. The depth to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar valuation. Dozens of media companies – *[CultofMac](https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/)*, *[MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/)*, *[Macworld](https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/)*, *[9to5 Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/)*, [AppleInsider](https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/), *[iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/)*, and... more – exist solely to cover one single independent company: **Apple, Incorporated**. One wonders how the sum total of the individuals involved with and these organizations compares with the total number of employees working for the company their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely centered around. (Further interesting questions: are there any comparable situations anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not – doesn't this sort of attention constitute *some kind* of Monopoly, even if it was not necessarily an anti-competitive one?) For “reasonable people,” the image one conjures up of *The All-The-Time Apple Beat* does not lend to envy, but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most casual forms of speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate time in my childhood development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt branded with a stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real live public Junior High school. There are few more embarrassing admissions, except perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It's the addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in its democratization. *Billionaires* are running the same operating system and much of the same software as I am every day – even the most followed person on any given platform is still accessing it through the same interface I might be. These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous lack of competition in a product category that has become more essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just three or four blinks of an eye.\n\n> some of those “indie” alternatives:[@Bandcamp](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bandcamp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) – music streamingMastodon – microblogging Diaspora – facebook  \n\n> PixelFed – instagram [https:\/\/t.co\/kCCVffPRR3](https:\/\/t.co\/kCCVffPRR3)  \n\n> — David Blue (@NeoYokel) [November 29, 2018](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1068037512738811904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \n\n*Fuck David Blue*, though. Who are the *real*, *hard-hitting* minds who've kept this industry and this company in check? Well, it's funny you should ask that, because the people's quirky *New York Times* tech critic of late – the esteemed [Farhad Manjoo](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/28\/technology\/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) – has just [concluded a five-year-long technology column](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/28\/technology\/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) with some essential (if perhaps a bit unoriginal) advice: “ **just slow down**.” If you're still following along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of his links, and I would certainly encourage that you do until you're out of free articles, at least. When Manjoo speaks, Apple listens: his January decree for Apple to bend with the industry wind and build “ [a Less Addictive iPhone](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/01\/17\/technology\/apple-addiction-iphone.html) ” is convincingly prophetic considering **Screen Time** – probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or little that may mean to you) just one or two years after I began using my\/the first iPhone, I've developed a history of what he might call *Addiction* to iPhones in variable oscillation [touching both extremes](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1042825995546320896). I carried my first-generation iPhone for almost 5 years – as you can imagine, it was far from a 100%-functional device toward the end of that bell curve. In contrast, I've also stood in line at dawn for two iPhone launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts *only* about apps (far before they were good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect upon all of it for as long as I can remember.\n\nThere's no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on my life mostly thanks to my own choices, which is why it's worth telling the vast majority of you that features like Screen Time will never help you achieve whatever vague conception of *reduced usage* you may have. If you haven't yet quantified the figures you'll find within it in mental estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you *have*, Screen Time will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize your appflow makes no attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using the phone so much, * **stop* using the fucking phone**. If you are truly concerned about how your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for a week\/month\/quarter – however long you *possibly* can. By that, I mean no more or less than what you can manage without getting fired\/dumped\/expelled\/etc. If you have *truly* reached this point, anything less is probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get a clear picture of how it's changed you.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of this, but know they can't *actually* advocate against the fundamental mechanism that drives their businesses, so they express concern by doing what they know: **building more software**. Apple is in a slightly different situation: they still need you to buy their phones – and even to look at them – but not past the point of hurting yourself emotionally, mentally, or physically because those injuries tend to hurt one *economically*. Screen Time's purpose is to keep us thriving and buying, but the only effective solve for this can only be communicated in garbage cinema language: **you must find it within yourself**. I am *actually* the worst person from which to model your life, except perhaps for my iPhone use: unless there's little else worthy of my attention, my phone is not out. Even if checking my [emails](mailto:davidblue@gmail.com), [Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue), [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel), etc. are my default tasks, there are infinitely many besides that come first. Every once in a while, it's okay to finish an important message while walking down the street or waiting at a stoplight if things are urgent, but I can guarantee you that my attention is better consolidated on traveling in 95% of cases – moving with purpose and then focusing on my composition *after* I've arrived is almost always more efficient. I realize that I'm cowboying it here and sound like your Dad, but I'm better with iOS than he is, yet I've never publicly run into anything while looking down at my smartphone in 10 years of hardcore use. **Find somebody who's company makes you forget about all of this for hours at a time and treasure them**. Also: **stop playing games on your phone**. *What the hell are you doing*? Read a blog! Explore the wonders of the open web! Your peers, your battery, and your elderly future self with thank you for it. (One exception is playing word\/trivia games with your partner. That's very cute and good for you.)\n\n*I was elated to see that even Apple supports my [age-old cause for Twitter Lists](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/moments\/996616971880882176). Also, the new function in Apple Music allowing the user to search by lyrics [appears to work very well](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1042825995546320896)...*\n\nTo get back to specifics, the **new Photos application** is now basically what it should have been all along, [3D Touch has been virtually eclipsed](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/circuitbreaker\/2018\/9\/24\/17896228\/ios-12-keyboard-trackpad-cursor-3d-touch-iphone-ipad) for those strange bastards among you who never liked it, and the release's most democratically-redeemable feature is **optimization**, which even on my iPhone 8 Plus was blatantly noticeable and very welcome. However, probably the best insight to come out of my long, rambly *End User* review was the revelation that basically any other human activity is a better use of time than [applauding Apple](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/9\/17\/17862236\/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri) for learning to hold new features off until they've been thoroughly tested and focusing instead on smoothing existing software. In fact, I'd argue there is absolutely no reason for someone like me to say anything even remotely positive about the world's wealthiest company ever again, though that doesn't apply to *The Verge* or Chaim Gartenberg, who's review – for the record – was much more useful to 9999 times more people than anything I'll ever write. However, isn't it sortof unreasonable to expect anything but *absolute perfection* from Apple at this trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying interpretations of absolute perfection per product category, even.\n\nWith gorgeous, iCloud-enabled premium apps like [Bear](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1063486573197561857) in the picture, integrating wholly into the Apple environment has maintained its relative rank above the alternatives to its specific minimal-esque utilitarian *niceness* which appeals so strongly to *those people* among both consumer and professional buyers. Readers from within this culture recognized a short time ago that [iOS is in the process of replacing MacOS](https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/ipad-pro-2018-review) as the star component of this environment across the board, though there's at least a moderate journey ahead before it truly reaches this achievement for the median user. For myself, iOS 12 improved the experience of using my 8 Plus and certainly gave me something intriguing to play with in Siri Shortcuts. For the rest of the world's billions of daily iOS users, I say *be as insatiable as possible* – always expect more.\n\n[#software](http:\/\/bilge.world\/tag:software)\n\n[Profound Revelations in iOS 12 — The Psalms](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review)\n\n#archive #i",

    "content" : "# Farewell, Periscope\n![](Farewell,%20Periscope\/_0*rngsqodt790lkpl-.jpeg)\nPeriscope Community,\n\nToday, we’re sharing that we have made the difficult decision to discontinue Periscope as a separate mobile app by March 2021.\n\nFirst off, we want to be transparent about why we’re making this decision, esecially to those of you who are active and passionate users of Periscope today. The truth is that ::the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while::. Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter. We still believe in the power of live video to solve impactful problems, which is why we’ve brought ::most of the core capabilities of Periscope into Twitter::. We probably would have made this decision sooner if it weren’t for all of the projects we reprioritized due to the events of 2020. We’re sharing our decision with you now because we want to be transparent and honest about where we’re at and what’s next.\n\nWe’re planning to remove Periscope from the app stores by March 2021, but no one will be able to create a new account in-app starting with the next release. Broadcasts that were shared to Twitter will live on as replays, and all broadcasters will be able to download an archive of their Periscope broadcasts and data before the app is removed in March 2021. You can find more info [here](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/using-twitter\/periscope-faq) about what will happen to your Super Hearts and broadcasts, how you can [go live on Twitter](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-live) going forward, and more.\n\nAlthough it’s time to say goodbye, the legacy of Periscope will live on far beyond the boundaries of the app itself. The capabilities and ethos of the Periscope team and infrastructure already permeate Twitter, and we’re confident that live video still has the potential of seeing an even wider audience within the Twitter product.\n\nMost importantly, we’re so grateful to all of you who invested time and energy into making Periscope the place to show what’s happening in your world and creating vibrant communities. We’ve [learned so much](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/NASA\/1eaJbvQMBpeJX), shared [incredible experiences](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/LADanceProject\/1YpJkndPQarGj?t=4m36s) together, witnessed [unforgettable moments in history](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ScottPetersSD\/status\/745654350022873088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E745654350022873088%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2016%2F06%2Fhouse-dems-use-twitter-make-gun-control-sit-public%2F), and seen [pockets of the world](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/EgyptWithAhmed\/1djGXRapZdexZ?t=4m18s) we could’ve only [imagined](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/w\/1gqxvXkjzdOGB?t=3h34m) when we first launched Periscope. It was a genuine honor to pour our heart and soul into building something that other people loved enough to use and build their own communities around. Thank you so much.\n\nMuch love,\n\nTeam Periscope\n\n[Farewell, Periscope](https:\/\/periscope.medium.com\/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c) #archive",

I should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for the hope – as I often do, to no avail – that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future tribulation.\n\nInstead, she called the police.\n\nThree round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were chuckling – maybe to a little joke about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just *SOP* when responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and – I swear to my new Lord – all three immediately released a choral “ohhhhh” in unison. I'll never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.\n\nClearly, I should've threatened *her* life.\n\nDespite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the discourse, the stream of “well, you know they were sayin' the world was going to end when *I* was in elementary school” to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We'll be lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps *are* widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing too much of our heat to ignore.\n\nThough it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be *well-to-do* of me now – nor was it, then – to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign for *Sheldon* to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but – as an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development – I must note that such a display of concern should've been at least reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in which to waste public servants' time.\n\nIt's not news – the *Theory* is providing *some* ghoulishly skewed portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded – if stretched – as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that's ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.\n\n*It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy and* Independence Day *, mom, but you're gonna have to* ***really pick up the pace*** *and work on following a few body modification communities on the darknet.*\n\nIf an absence of *solutions* are the crux of the *blog*, here I'm now gloating.\n\nTo whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer not to terrorize their kooky middle age parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence?\n\nThe Big Thinkers! The Men of the Hour.\n\nYes, *men.* All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.\n\nElon Musk *cannot* be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the *20th*, for that matter, because literally *every* mechanically-minded professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion of electrochemical storage is *the* False Prophet.\n\nNo, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable spacecraft, but I've been a bit too preoccupied with my country's class war and its [10% adult illiteracy rate](http:\/\/bit.ly\/unescoliteracy). It's all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.\n\nWell. Maybe not...\n\nCharles Lindbergh would be, though.\n\nWe spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of [some statistics](http:\/\/bit.ly\/measuringconsumerinfo) on the volume of media we consume, they'd exclaim of their pride – no doubt – in their species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it. However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, and a [huge portion](http:\/\/bit.ly\/millennialspew) of the blame can be placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nHis name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.\n\n[Zuckbrain](https:\/\/backchannel.com\/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3) is fucking scary.\n\n“ [Wiring the globe](http:\/\/bit.ly\/zuckfuck) ” is fucking scary.\n\n[Jarvis](http:\/\/bit.ly\/zuckbot) is fucking scary.\n\nBut Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack of *class* in the criticisms of his intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's [attention](http:\/\/bit.ly\/fuckbug) has been diligent and premium as a *Times* er's should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the color of unsubstantiated claims.\n\nMine does not.\n\nElon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to [joke](http:\/\/bit.ly\/aloofmusk) about his intellectual distance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.\n\nGoogle is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they're too far gone – I do not have the expertise to address them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, *Even Stevens* -haired young man [without](http:\/\/bit.ly\/crowdfuck) so much as private office space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are [obviously inverse](http:\/\/bit.ly\/fuckflex).)\n\nClearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: **The Apostle John's** ***Book of Revelation*** **is about Facebook**. Fuck's cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, *and* the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical website.\n\n> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.  \n\nIf I can *repeatedly* trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don't tell me it's not possible to inadvertently live stream myself on the pot.\n\n> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.  \n\nOf course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil, but – like Tump, in many ways – he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he *is* spending 2017 touring the United States, he [doesn't seem](http:\/\/bit.ly\/fucklearning) to be all that interested in *actually* closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can't imagine what *The Mothership* would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though.\n\n> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.  \n\nJust to be clear, **he is not** ***The Antikhristos***.\n\nHe'd better not be, anyway. I'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.\n\nI mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn't he just build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of *the actual* weekly-updated tower of digital Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd be because The Tempter is an authority on *incentive* s as thoroughly as Fuck isn't.\n\nIf you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s political consequences, recently. Frankly, *it’s about Fucking time*, but I’m compelled to emphasize that the most significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, “the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want,” dipping in Facebook's ocean of action data, searching for a soul.\n\nYet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that *nobody* knows what they want.\n\nThere's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of contradiction. If you've ever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac\/adderall fiend who has, you may have heard it described as “the lizard brain.” Simply put, it's the brain stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. *The Great Clickbait War* of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian bits – the true location of its power.\n\n“In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them?”\n\n*Volition* is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, *Smart House*: **when dealing with human beings, boundless compliance quickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.**\n\nMindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... **this is how we die**.\n\nSomething about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he *is* assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can jog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of brain-rotting filth.\n\nIn lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still send you the occasional *Can Crunch Saga* invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves in your mind with the horrors of mortality and **f u c k b o o k g a m e s.**\n\nElon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult masses.\n\nMore than one sixth of all living eyes [see](https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/company-info\/) Fuckbook every single day, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most universally human activity.\n\nMr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who's ever lived. He's taught (or... is teaching) us something very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to *connection*. Population is not a cure for isolation.\n\nThat said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who've depended upon a “very meaningful” Fuckbook group for a “physical support structure” for which I have Fuck to thank.\n\nI've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots – military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself. As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but my local community is *very* sparse – it's not exactly *cool*, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay connected to the rest of the world's Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with 100% sincerity and emotional effect.\n\nPhotos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a similar pose after their first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans...\n\nThey tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.\n\nI stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of challenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the community will *always* have a tremendous dividend of my core being.\n\nThese days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn't be laudable whatsoever – it's not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment – were it not so *emotionally* necessary for me.\n\nA few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit, captioned “what airplane am I?”\n\nIn my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood hero' role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of *The Spirit of St.Louis* from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I carried it *literally everywhere* with me until middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw the *Spirit* in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've *never* had an informed conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many of the comments were correct answers.\n\nBreaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth who give a shit about the same things you do.\n\nAgain – aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision for his creation, and it *is* feasible, even for myself. At least his public persona – however valid or invalid it may be – is making a huge effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself within all of humanity.\n\nFuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook's done to the Western psyche over the past decade, but – like the Christian god – perhaps all we need require is his repentance.\n\n*I Refuse to Die Clicking*\n\n[Mark Fuck and the Goofy Godheads — The Psalms](http:\/\/bilge.world\/mark-zuckerberg) \n\n#archive",

    "content" : "# Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get - The Verge\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/bfarsace_201106_4269_030.0.jpg)\n\nThe iPhone 12 Pro Max is a big phone. The biggest iPhone ever made, in fact.\n\nThe Pro Max’s 6.7-inch display is the largest screen ever on an iPhone. It has the biggest camera sensor of any iPhone, including the three other iPhone 12 models Apple announced this year. It has a 5G radio, and it’s got a bigger battery. It is without question the most iPhone you can get.\n\nAnd while it’s expensive, it’s not *that* much more expensive than the smaller iPhone 12 Pro: it’s just $100 more at every storage level, starting at $1,099 with 128GB of storage and going up to $1,399 for 512GB of storage. For that money, you get a larger display, a bigger battery, and a very different camera system. I’ll just cut to the chase and say it’s absolutely worth it over the standard 12 Pro if you can deal with the size — but it’s a lot of size. And the camera is worth exploring in depth, because there’s a lot going on. \n\nLike I said, it’s the most iPhone you can get.\n\nThere’s just no getting around it: the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a very big phone. The measurements don’t tell the whole story — by the numbers, it’s just a little bit bigger than the 11 Pro Max, but the new design with flat sides makes it feel much larger than it is, and makes it slightly harder to hold than a phone with curved sides. It’s also a bit heavier than other big phones like the [Galaxy Note 20 Ultra](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21372109\/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes) and [iPhone 11 Pro Max](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/9\/17\/20868727\/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price), which makes it feel even bigger.\n\nThe combination of the size and flat sides basically demands a case to make it easier to hold, which makes the whole thing even bigger. It’s still workable, but it is right on the edge of being too big. I think the size is a reflection of increased choice: this year Apple has more phone sizes available than ever before, including the diminutive [iPhone 12 mini](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/e\/21319336), so it had the ability to push the Max even farther.\n\nBut: it’s still big. I strongly recommend finding a way to **safely** see the 12 Pro Max’s size in person before making a call on ordering one.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/bfarsace_201106_4269_022.0.jpg)\nThe 12 Pro Max has a larger main camera sensor than the other iPhone 12 models.\n## iPhone 12 Pro Max Camera\n\nAside from the large size, the main thing that sets the iPhone 12 Pro Max apart from the rest of the iPhone 12 line is the camera system, which is substantially different and more capable than the cameras on the smaller 12 and 12 Pro.\n\nThe basics are the same as the 12 Pro: three cameras including a wide, an ultrawide, and a tele, with a LIDAR sensor that enables portrait photos on the wide camera in Night mode. Night mode is available at all three zoom levels now, which is an improvement over the iPhone 11.\n\nThe ultrawide camera is the same as on the 12 and 12 Pro, and it’s a noticeable improvement over the ultrawide on the 11 Pro. I think it’s useful and fun to have an ultrawide, but it still takes medium-quality photos compared to the main camera.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/bfarsace_201106_4269_028.0.jpg)\nThe telephoto lens on the 12 Pro Max is also slightly different, with a longer field of view.\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/bfarsace_201106_4269_014.0.jpg)\nThe camera bump on the 12 Pro Max is larger than the 12 Pro.\nIt’s the main wide camera and the telephoto that are very different on the 12 Pro Max. The wide has the same f\/1.6 lens as the 12 and 12 Pro, but it also has a 47-percent larger physical sensor that can capture more light with less noise. The wide camera is also stabilized differently than the other iPhone 12 models, which have traditional lens-based optical image stabilization to reduce vibrations and thus blur.\n\nThe 12 Pro Max uses sensor-shift stabilization, which moves the sensor itself around to reduce vibrations. Apple tells me the move to sensor-shift stabilization on the 12 Pro Max was more about making this sensor size work to its standards than overall performance, but that the system on the 12 Pro Max is slightly more effective at reducing a wider range of vibrations than the OIS on the 12 Pro.\n\n(As an aside for camera nerds, Apple keeps calling this “sensor-shift OIS,” which doesn’t quite make sense because the lens isn’t involved. It’s more like the in-body stabilization you’ll find on Sony and Panasonic mirrorless cameras. But I digress.)\n\nThe bigger sensor also has an impressive maximum ISO, which is a measure of light sensitivity. The iPhone 11 Pro had a top ISO of 3,072, the regular iPhone 12 Pro has a top ISO of 5,808, and the 12 Pro Max has a top ISO of 7,616. As the numbers go up, the amount of noise at any given ISO tends to go down, which means images from the iPhone 12 Pro Max are generally less noisy than the 12 Pro’s.\n\n> The 12 Pro Max’s main camera is one of the most confident smartphone cameras I’ve ever used  \n\nThe upshot of all this is simple: the wide camera on the iPhone 12 Pro Max is one of the most confident smartphone cameras I’ve ever used. It can take great photos in a huge variety of situations, and rarely feels pushed beyond its limits.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/4269_bright_light_all.jpg)\nIn broad daylight it’s hard to tell the pics from any modern high-end phone apart. | Left to right: Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple iPhone 12 Pro, Google Pixel 5, Samsung Note 20 Ultra\nYou won’t always see the benefit from that increased capability; it really depends on what kind of light you’re taking photos in. In sunlight and other bright situations, photos from the 12 Pro Max and 12 Pro look identical to me — we’re at the point where photos from all the major flagships are starting to look the same. Yes, there are differences: the Pixel 5 is a little more contrasty, the iPhone still boosts shadows the most aggressively, and the Note 20 does some weird things with reds and yellows, but when any of these cameras gets enough light, they produce photos that are more alike than different.\n\nBut when the light gets dimmer, the 12 Pro Max really starts to stand out.\n\nTake this photo I took at sunset: all the phones did a fine enough job, but the 12 Pro Max has far less noise, better and more accurate colors, and more detail.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/12promaxIMG_0042.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/12proIMG_5408.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/PXL_20201103_215341153.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/note20ultra20201103_165422.jpg)\n\nApple iPhone 12 Pro Max, Apple iPhone 12 Pro, Google Pixel 5, Samsung Note 20 Ultra. The Pro Max captures better colors and more detail as the light starts to drop.\n\nUnder slightly darker conditions, most of the phones automatically shifted to their respective night modes, where they take multiple long exposures and merge them together. But the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s bigger sensor, with its higher maximum ISO, means it doesn’t automatically go into Night mode as often. And when the iPhone 12 Pro Max *does* go into Night mode, it does so with shorter exposures than the 12 Pro — in situations where the 12 Pro would take a three-second exposure, the 12 Pro Max only needed a one-second shot, resulting in a sharper photo. \n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/12promaxIMG_0125.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/12proIMG_0012.jpg)\n\nApple iPhone 12 Pro Max left, Apple iPhone 12 Pro right. The 12 Pro took a 3-second night mode shot here, while the Pro Max only needed a 1-second exposure.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/12promaxIMG_0141.0.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/PXL.0.jpg)\n\nApple iPhone 12 Pro Max left, Google Pixel 5 right. The Pro Max captured far more detail in a night mode portrait shot.\n\n(Night mode itself has been improved across the iPhone 12 line: the iPhone 11 took Night mode shots by merging together frames with a one-second maximum exposure time, but the iPhone 12 lineup can capture two-second stabilized frames, allowing for better shadows with less noise. And if the phone detects that it’s on a tripod, it will turn off image stabilization and capture three-second frames, for a maximum 30-second night mode shot composed of ten three-second frames. The iPhone 11 would take thirty one-second frames.)\n\nThe LIDAR sensor lets you shoot portraits in Night mode using the wide camera, which, combined with the better overall low light performance, means that Night mode portraits are better and more detailed on the 12 Pro Max than the 12 Pro and Pixel 5. It’s impressive.\n\nOverall, when it comes to low light, it feels like no contest: the iPhone 12 Pro Max consistently took better, more detailed, and less noisy photos than the Pixel 5 and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Look at how muddy the Pixel 5 looks in this basic sunset photo compared to the Pro Max, and look at how washed out the image of the truck from the Note 20 looks. Apple has noticeably moved ahead of the pack here.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/_PXL_20201103_215341153.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/_12promaxIMG_0042.jpg)\n\nGoogle Pixel 5 left, Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max right\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/note20ultra20201103_165035.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/12promax.jpg)\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 20 left, Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max right\n\nYou might be expecting some dramatic change to depth of field because of the brighter aperture and bigger sensor — I certainly was — and while close-up photos do have a slightly increased background blur, it’s not particularly more noticeable to my eye than the 12 Pro. If you’re looking for that dramatic DSLR-style bokeh, you’ll still need to turn on Portrait mode.\n\nThe benefits of the bigger sensor are less apparent in video — and really, they’re only really noticeable if you’re watching on a larger screen like a TV. At night, you’ll see a little more detail and less noise in the shadows compared to the 12 Pro, and there’s the tiniest more detail in bright light, but you have to go looking for it. We already thought the 12 Pro was far ahead of the pack in terms of video, and the 12 Pro Max is maybe a tiny bit better, but it’s not nearly as dramatic as the improvement in stills.\n\n(I did a deep dive on Dolby Vision in our [12 Pro review](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21524288\/apple-iphone-12-pro-review), and all the promise is there, as are the compatibility challenges, so go watch that video for more. And there’s still a lot of lens flare going on. Apple told me that there shouldn’t be any increased lens flare over the iPhone 11 line, but that the improved low-light performance means people are noticing it more, which feels roughly equivalent to saying “I’m a perfectionist” when someone asks you for your biggest weakness. Sure.)\n\nThe telephoto camera is less straightforwardly improved. It is essentially the same sensor as the 12 Pro, but with a longer 2.5x zoom and a less-bright f\/2.2 lens instead of the 2x f\/2.0 lens on the regular 12 Pro. So: a longer zoom that can pick up less light. It’s a tradeoff, but I found I really enjoyed having the tighter zoom, and I went to use it more than the telephoto on my 11 Pro. It performed slightly worse in lower light than the 2x zoom on 12 Pro, but I think it still has the upper hand compared to the Note 20 Ultra and Pixel 5 — Apple’s Smart HDR 3 is really good this year, with excellent noise reduction and vibrant colors that are still accurate.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/_12promaxIMG_0131.jpg)\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/12proIMG_0017.jpg)\n\nThe iPhone 12 Pro Max’s telephoto camera has a slightly longer reach the the 12 Pro’s, but it’s grainier in low light. | Left: Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, Right: Apple iPhone 12 Pro\n\nAll in all, the combination of the larger sensor, faster lens, improved stabilization, LIDAR, and processing power means that the iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best smartphone camera I’ve ever used — it produces terrific, colorful photos with excellent detail in lighting situations where other phones start to struggle. We’ve seen Android phone makers like Samsung and Huawei use much bigger sensors this year with a variety of complicated techniques to make them work, but Apple’s approach of pairing a moderate sensor size jump with its focus on improved processing has kept it in the lead. I’m intrigued by Apple’s new ProRAW format that promises the editing flexibility of RAW images from this sensor with the processing of Smart HDR… but it’s not out yet, so we’ll have to wait.\n\nLastly, I have to mention the selfie camera, which is stubbornly the same as the other iPhone 12s. Many people will use the selfie camera more often than the telephoto or ultrawide cameras; it’s well overdue for a serious improvement.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/bfarsace_201106_4269_001.0.jpg)\nThe 6.7-inch OLED screen is the largest ever for an iPhone.\n## iPhone 12 Pro Max Display\n\nApart from the cameras, the rest of the iPhone 12 Pro Max is very similar to the iPhone 12 Pro. The display is obviously bigger, but it’s just as bright and colorful, and the pixel density is essentially the same. And there’s not a ton more information presented on the big screen by default. I think that’s a shame — this thing is veering into tablet territory in terms of size, and I’d like to see Apple allow app developers to make better use of all this real estate.\n\n> Every other flagship phone this year has a 120Hz display, it’s odd for the top of the line iPhone to not have it  \n\nDisappointingly, the iPhone 12 Pro Max still has a 60Hz-refresh-rate display, while virtually every Android phone above $600 is now at 120Hz. This was maybe passable on the standard 12, but on the 12 Pro and especially the Pro Max, I think it’s a miss — it’s the most expensive iPhone with the biggest battery, and the display shouldn’t be one tick behind the competition. Maybe next year.\n\nThe 12 Pro Max adds the same MagSafe magnetic wireless charging system as the other iPhone 12s, but Apple’s charging adapters are expensive and suffer from the usual USB-C spec confusion. I am *eagerly* anticipating the first wave of MagSafe [car mounts](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/circuitbreaker\/2020\/10\/14\/21516404\/belkin-magsafe-boostcharge-pro-charger-car-mount-iphone-12-accessories) and [other accessories](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/11\/2\/21545486\/moment-magsafe-iphone-12-case-mount-announced) — MagSafe has all the potential to be terrific, but Apple’s ability to build and nurture accessory ecosystems around its connector ideas is iffy at best. (See: the near-total lack of iPad keyboards that use the Smart Connector.)\n\n## 5G on the iPhone 12 Pro Max\n\nI tested the 12 Pro on Verizon’s network, which offers ultrafast millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G on various street corners and sports stadiums around the country, so for the 12 Pro Max I used AT&T’s network. And 5G in the US continues to be a deeply mixed bag that is barely worth discussing.\n\nSpeeds where I could find AT&T’s [standard 5G service](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/12\/13\/21014816\/att-low-band-5g-network-broad-10-cities-launch-speeds-internet) were not so much better than really good LTE, and AT&T’s mmWave network is essentially nowhere to be found. And AT&T’s 5G plan automatically enables a “feature” called Stream Saver which streams all video at 480p because this so-called “unlimited” plan has complicated limits. So you’ve got a huge phone with a beautiful display and a fast connection that displays most video in… DVD resolution. C’mon.\n\n> 5G in the US is more hype than reality and you can ignore it  \n\nI don’t mean to just dunk on AT&T: Sascha Segan at PC Mag just released data showing that 5G in the US is [slower than anywhere else in the world](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/race-to-5g-5g-limps-to-nationwide-status). So 5G is not only hard to find, it’s slower. If there was ever a “ [race to 5G](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/5\/23\/18637213\/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte),” the United States has lost.\n\nAnyway, I cannot stress this enough: 5G in the United States is more hype than reality, and you should not buy a phone because of it. Just ignore it for another year. It’ll be fine.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/bfarsace_201106_4269_027.0.jpg)\nThe big size of the Pro Max allows for a big battery, which translates into big battery life.\n## iPhone 12 Pro Max Performance and Battery Life\n\nThe iPhone 12 Pro Max is a big phone, and as such, it has a big battery. And so battery life is terrific. At home, on WiFi, I saw screen-on times of as long as 14 hours as I doomscrolled through our interminable election, with an average of well over eight hours in more reasonable (and healthy) use over the course of a week. Now, I’m not leaving my house as much as I did before the pandemic, and I didn’t test a lot on 5G or even LTE, but with numbers like that, I’d expect battery life overall to be tremendous in almost any circumstance. Big phone, big battery, big battery life. It makes the lack of a 120Hz display puzzling.\n\n![](Apple%20iPhone%2012%20Pro%20Max%20review%20the%20best%20smartphone%20camera%20you%20can%20get%20-%20The%20Verge\/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.jpg)\nThe iPhone 12 Pro Max is the most iPhone you can buy.\nI’m just going to say it again: the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a very big phone. Big ambition, big camera sensor, big… size. I’ve been using it for a week, and I still haven’t gotten used to how big it is. I’m curious to see how accessory makers handle the size.\n\nBut the size allows for what I think is easily the best and most capable smartphone camera on the market right now, and a battery that seems to last forever. If you can deal with the size, I think it’s worth passing over the 12 Pro and getting the 12 Pro Max. Those are two dramatic and meaningful improvements for the money. This is a tremendous phone.\n\n> The best iPhone... if you can deal with its size  \n\nBut I can’t shake the feeling that the iPhone 12 Pro Max very much feels like the perfect phone for the life I led *before* the pandemic. I used to spend a lot of time commuting, and on airplanes, and otherwise out and about getting work done on my phone. I used to go to a lot of events at night and take a lot of photos in bars. My notes indicate that I used to care a lot about mobile network speeds. This phone would have made significant improvements to all those things, but right now it just feels like another screen for social media on the couch.\n\nI have a kid, and I always buy the latest phone to have the best camera. And there’s no question that this is the best camera. But if you’re feeling that usual tug to upgrade and you don’t *need* to, I do think you can wait this one out. Maybe 5G will be better next year. Maybe we’ll get that 120Hz display.\n\nAlso: did I mention that it’s big?\n\n[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: the best smartphone camera you can get](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21555901\/iphone-12-pro-max-review)\n\n#archive #iP12PM",

    "content" : "# On Face ID\nSo on face ID specifically hi I'm looking at my iPhone A+ review right now 2 1\/2 years ago I am and I guess you know what I guess this review really I said actually just ring something that I can't sit down and read my own shit anymore I am I was really better about the iPhone ex I just didn't like it I am very I was resistant to change I've been using the same shape of iPhone since 2007 since I was that we young man in the picture with the holding it on with KFC picture of him he only does require as a Nilay Patel noted one might regard the eight is the last compromise of basically four years of the same side since launch it's unsurprisingly stayed away that too far behind on the spreadsheets for most android type folks not that I've ever believed and truly in capable of comprehending what it means to package of product given where the greasy start up salt it up And then parentheses you cannot doubt me I want to be your long sabbatical from Iowa is for the Sony is free to play arm and my authority is absolutely the rest are trying to decide whether not to pay $200 more for \"the phone at the future which knows when you're watching it and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge yeah I am OK so face and he specifically I've only had this phone for a few days Jesus him to three days oh my God I get it oh my God for things like my password manager am in comparison to using a thumb holy hell yeah I guess I've been OK I've only use it in good light but then again when am I ever I mean your screen is bright yeah I can't I entire fleetly get it to and yeah I know that annotation which may or may not show up because apparently hypothesis but has been breaking my posts and I might turn it off but since being like the annotation thing that pops up I am on bills the world but a arm what I say go back oh it's pouring out that like yes I'm at I said I'd rather have experienced it in a big boy top line flag ship handset after 2 1\/2 years of refinement I assume I assume their face ID is better now than it was then everything I said about face ID this review sound stupid entirely unnecessary at best I am yeah it's I can see it in this phone at least I'm in a in a very very a constrain conditions which I have used it being in my house lamps on screens I am god it's so much easier than using my thumb so much easier and you know him well while I'm on that topic I guess maybe I should put the clip\n- - - -\nThe mask thing is a problem... I’ve had the immense privilege of *not* having to wear a mask for an entire workday (honestly not sure how I would manage it considering that my glasses immediately fog up completely when I have worn a mask,) but I played around with setting up Face ID’s “alternate appearance” option, which seems like it would do the trick. It would be nice if one could set up multiple alternate appearances - I needed to use my single slot for my appearance when wearing my Bose Soundlink headphones. I’m genuinely curious if you’ve found success with it.\n\n#i #iP12PM #transcription",

    "content" : "# Aquaman (2018)\nWell… What I picked up from this film was unlike any other superhero movie I’ve ever seen, which is important to celebrate considering the endlessly-regurgative Marvel hell we’ve found ourselves enslaved to. Unfortunately, the cinematography and special effects were… wrong, somehow. I say so with no small amount of caution - I don’t want to condemn a single filmmaking decision simply because it’s different from what I’m used to. Again - considering that films have become such stagnant, digestible products - *any* sort of genuine originality and\/or innovation in the process of a major title’s production should be praised… dare I say it… even if it’s just…bad.\n\nI did *not* really give *Aquaman* my full attention, though, nor have I read anything else about it. I guess I hope some folks loved it for its particular departures in that way which makes films truly special in their memory. \n\n[Review on Letterboxd](https:\/\/boxd.it\/1E9W2b)\n#cinema",

    "content" : "# Keyboard Shortcuts Bug Feedback Report\nFeb 4, 2021 at 13:40\nNote: this issue has occurred with Full Keyboard Access turned ~OFF~.\nDuring the course of normal usage in Safari, Bear, Drafts, and Tweetbot, I have experienced four instances now (seemingly untriggered,) where keyboard shortcuts have ceased working. (Example shortcuts: ⌘ + Up and Down arrows, Unmodified Up and Down arrows to scroll, ⌘ + [ and ], ⌘+L. I can list more examples if it’d be useful.)\nI have tried toggling the handset’s Bluetooth function on\/off both in the Command Center and in Settings with no effect. Keyboard reconnects but the shortcuts are still unresponsive. The same goes for switching the keyboard itself on and off. The only solution appears to be rebooting the handset.\nAt this time, I don’t know what causes this issue. It’s happened seemingly at random.\n- - - -\nFeb 4, 2021 at 23:56\nThe issue occurred again just a few minutes ago, so I searched out and installed the Bluetooth Logging Profile from the Developer website and (apparently) successfully triggered a syslog using the [both volume buttons + side button] command, though **I DID NOT REBOOT THE DEVICE** between installing the profile and triggering the syslog because it would have corrected the issue before I could log it. \nI have attached both the syslog file and a short screen recording (including my audio commentary) of the shortcuts not working in Safari. If it’s important, I believe the device was still capturing this log while I was recording this screen recording.\n<a href='IMG_1618.MP4'>IMG_1618.MP4<\/a>\n<a href='sysdiagnose_2021.02.04_23-36-44-0600_iPhone-OS_iPhone_18D52.tar.gz'>sysdiagnose_2021.02.04_23-36-44-0600_iPhone-OS_iPhone_18D52.tar.gz<\/a>\n#documentation #keys",

The home screen starts simple, but it can be complex if you want it to and Apple's also finally putting different elements on top of other elements so you can see Siri on top of your current screen instead of taking over the whole screen.  \n- [x] There is less to iOS 14 that's relevant to my life, personally, than any other release I remember, but that's okay.\n- [ ] \"[iOS 14 Hands-On Tour: Hidden Feature & Widgets!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/z2wNLoS0-HU)\" | Soldier Knows Best on YouTube\n- [x] I'm pretty sure I do not think widgets belong on mobile...

According to Apple, Siri now knows 20 times the number of facts that it did three years ago, and we haven’t been able to catch it out with anything so far.  \n\n### App Library\nI'm not sure an alphabetized listing of all apps is really that useful.

Of course, this also makes her the definitive *worst* in functional terms, yet she remains the only one which has added (albeit diminutive) value to my own life. The “disable all alarms” command - while it should probably exist on its own in the native Clocks app - is a particularly useful function. \n\n- [ ] I actually witnessed a 20-year-old, well-adjusted young woman in the wild use Hey Siri to make a call, yesterday.\n\n\n## iMessage\n[[Twitter Poll](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1357090979216523264?s=21)]\n[[Mastodon Poll](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/105669638356618385)]\nIn my iPhone 8 Plus review, I noted:\n> ...frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the  [gluttonous](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/audio\/futureland\/toomanymessengers\/)  palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram,  [now Telegram X](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/telegram-x) , WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, Tinder?, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… well, none of this will do!  \nSeveral of these are either defunct or scandalized, in the present, though Telegram, especially, [has been thriving](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/28\/22253918\/telegram-ios-chat-history-import-whatsapp-line-kakaotalk). \n- - - -\n- [ ] Fonts?\n- [ ] As with many iOS feature additions, these days, **Widgets** seem in large part to address a problem which Apple made for themselves by removing some other, much-less-complex function from the operating system.

I spent a few days feverishly searching for information on URL schemes, learning how to build actions and run them through the Drafts URL action engine, and figuring out the best way to create a chain which connected more than Federico’s record of three apps. When I triumphantly sat back and watched my iPad run an action sequence automatically chaining five apps together (Drafts, Dropbox, Due, Instapaper and Chrome), I had no idea that it would lead to [an article being written about me here](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/links\/alex-guyot-chains-5-apps-with-drafts\/), starting a blog to have a place to write about the actions I was building, an opportunity to beta test Drafts, and the chance to connect with all kinds of interesting, like-minded people from all over the world.\n\nSince that time, less than a year ago, iOS automation has exploded in power and popularity. It feels like a new app adds support for [x-callback-url](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/) almost every week. Drafts still stands tall as one of the front runners in the field, having added awesome new features to make far more powerful workflows possible since last February, but other apps compete as well. Launch Center Pro and Pythonista are notable, and the latest challenger, [Editorial for iPad](http:\/\/appstore.com\/editorial), rode in on [a blaze of Viticci-inspired glory](http:\/\/macstories.net\/stories\/editorial-for-ipad-review). So much has changed since the beginning of last year, but there’s one important aspect which, surprisingly, has not. While the field of iOS automation has paraded forward, the gateway into the fun, learning the skills to understand and build the URL actions that make inter-app communication possible, has remained almost unchanged. Information is more readily available from the introduction of many new sources, but it remains scattered and decentralized. The inner workings of URL schemes are not incredibly complex, but when interested individuals must spend hours searching for the right sources all across the internet, the process becomes confusing, boring, and far more time consuming than necessary.\n\nSince I first started The Axx (and created [The Action Page](http:\/\/theaxx.net\/actionpage) as a place to make my actions available to anyone who wanted them), I have been asked again and again if I knew of a place to go to quickly and easily learn how to understand and build these actions. I have grown tired of having no good answer to this question. As a result, I have decided to take my best shot at creating a source for that answer. This article will attempt to centralize all of the necessary information for a complete beginner to quickly and easily go from little to no prior knowledge of the subject to being able to understand and build their own complex workflows with Drafts and URL actions. I will only be focusing on Drafts here, but the skills learned throughout this guide should be easily transferable to other apps, like [Launch Center Pro](http:\/\/contrast.co\/launch-center-pro\/) and [Editorial](http:\/\/omz-software.com\/editorial\/index.html). For intermediate, and perhaps even expert action-builders, I will hopefully have some tips that will interest you as well in the last few sections of the article.\n\nBefore we begin, be sure to enable the “Allow URLs to trigger actions” setting (found almost all the way to the bottom of the settings pane in Drafts under “URL Security”), which is disabled by default. This setting will allow you to trigger actions externally via URL, a key component to chaining apps together with Drafts, or using apps like Launch Center Pro or Bookmarklets in Safari to run Drafts actions automatically.\n\nSo here it is, my Comprehensive Guide to URL Schemes and Drafts Actions.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n## The Basics\n\nThe trick to improving and automating your workflows on iOS is to use Drafts as the central hub for all text input which you are planning on later outputting somewhere. Your tweets, your App.net, Google+ and Facebook posts, your calendar events, your blog posts – if you start it all with Drafts, you can automate it all with Drafts.\n\nWithin Drafts, all outputting begins with your Action List. The action list is accessed via the share icon in the top right corner of the app. Upon tapping it, a list of every action you have installed will be displayed on your screen, on top of whatever draft you have open (each individual page of text you have saved in Drafts is referred to as a “draft” as opposed to “note” or any other terminology like that). Tap an action and it will immediately be run on whichever draft is currently open beneath the action list. Actions have the ability to take the text you’ve written in your draft and do…pretty much anything with it. Besides posting it to social networks, you could upload it to Dropbox, send it to Evernote, email it, message it, or send it to another app and let that app do something with it. Once you learn how to make custom actions, the options for outputting your text from Drafts are basically limitless.\n\n![](Automating%20iOS%20A%20Comprehensive%20Guide%20to%20URL%20Schemes%20and%20Drafts%20Actions\/2013-11-07%252007-47-24%2520PM-drafts_guide-iPadScreenshot1.png)\nDrafts for iOS \n\nDrafts comes with quite a few preinstalled actions already in your action list. Once you link Drafts to your Twitter, Facebook, App.net, Evernote and Dropbox accounts in settings, you enable more built-in actions for these services as well. These most basic actions are completely self-explanatory: they quite simply take the entire contents of your currently open draft and send it to whatever service the action you’re running pertains to. Simple actions like these will end up being the building blocks for many of the more complex workflows that you can create, because all workflows are built by chaining together simpler actions.\n\nHere is a basic example. My [Cross Post](http:\/\/theaxx.net\/crosspostaction) action posts the text I write in a draft to both Twitter and App.net, automatically. However, while the action does post them *automatically*, it does not post them *simultaneously*. There is a key difference here, and it must be understood in order to understand how to build more complex URL actions. I cannot tell Drafts to both Tweet and post a draft to App.net at the exact same time. I can, however, tell it to tweet the current draft, then open a new draft with the exact same text, and post that one to App.net. This is how my Cross Post action works, and this is how all complex actions must work. **You can only run a single action on any single draft**, but you can then leverage the advanced tools provided by Drafts (that is, its x-callback-url capabilities and its built-in variable tags), in order to create an entirely new draft (which contains the text from the old one) and run an entirely different action on it. If that logic is still confusing to you, bear with me and it should be made more clear as we get into the URLs themselves.\n\nAll Drafts actions come in the form of short strips of code know as “URL actions”, which are drawn from the “URL schemes” of apps. You add new URL actions in Drafts by going to Settings –> URL Actions and hitting the plus button. Then type in the name of your action in the first box, and the URL of your action in the second box. You can use the “Tag Help” button to find a list of available `[[variable tags]]` which can be used in your actions (we’ll discuss those later). Before you start adding actions, you have to understand what they do and how they’re built.\n\n![](Automating%20iOS%20A%20Comprehensive%20Guide%20to%20URL%20Schemes%20and%20Drafts%20Actions\/2013-11-07%252007-49-59%2520PM-drafts_guide-1-2.png)\nDrafts for iOS \n\niOS apps are sandboxed, meaning they are only allowed to interact with the operating system (and other apps) in very limited ways. One of these ways has always been through URL actions. This is how opening a link in any app can automatically move you over to Safari with the corresponding webpage open, or tapping an address can take you into Maps with a pin on the specified location. Safari and Maps both have URL schemes which support this type of communication. Third-party developers have managed to take advantage of this small opening through which apps can “talk” to each other to make incredible things possible by giving their apps powerful URL Schemes.\n\nA URL scheme is built in a very similar manner to the website URLs that you are likely familiar with. Just as every website has its own personal domain name, which the URLs of all webpages within the site begin with, every iOS app which has the ability to be used in your automation workflows also has its own personal “domain name,” and every action supported by the app must begin with the same name. This “domain name” of the app, combined with all the possible actions that you are allowed to perform by adding onto it, make up the app’s URL scheme.\n\nDomain names for websites are always “http:\/\/yourwebsite.com”, or something similar to that, but “domain names” for apps (the first level of their URL scheme) are always `yourapp:\/\/`. Furthermore, as you add onto the end of a website URL, such as “http:\/\/yourwebsite.com\/about”, you will go further into the site, accessing a page deeper in the site’s hierarchy than the home page. This is the same for app URLs, except that adding to the end of `yourapp:\/\/` can cause the app to perform an actual action, instead of simply moving you to a view different than the main view of the app. If this concept is still confusing, learning the Drafts URL scheme should make it a lot clearer.\n\n## The Drafts URL Scheme\n\nBefore you can build and chain actions quickly and easily, you must understand the hierarchy of the Drafts URL scheme.\n\nThe “domain name” for Drafts is, not surprisingly, `drafts:\/\/`. If you’re reading this on an iOS device with Drafts installed, type “drafts:\/\/” into the Safari address bar and hit return (if you’re using Google Chrome or another browser that isn’t Safari, you may need to press the second option that pops up under the omni-bar to follow the URL, otherwise your browser will attempt to search the term in Google instead). Don’t worry, it won’t take you off of this page. Rather, it should launch you out of whichever web browser you’re in and open Drafts at whatever position you left the app in (if you have the app set to create a new draft upon launch, that will happen, too). When you’re done, come back here and keep reading.\n\n![](Automating%20iOS%20A%20Comprehensive%20Guide%20to%20URL%20Schemes%20and%20Drafts%20Actions\/2013-11-07%252007-47-24%2520PM-drafts_guide-iPadGIF1.gif)\nDrafts for iOS \n\nCongratulations: if you’re totally new to this, you just launched your first URL action. However, it didn’t actually do anything, so it wasn’t really much of an action, was it? That’s where the rest of the Drafts URL scheme comes in. `drafts:\/\/` is only the top level of the scheme. As we now enter the second level, we have two options – two routes we could take. Drafts supports the second level URLs of `drafts:\/\/create?` Or `drafts:\/\/import_action?`. Before we get into those, though, there’s one last piece that we can’t forget: the x-callback-url.\n\nThe x-callback-url is a specification created by [Greg Pierce](https:\/\/twitter.com\/agiletortoise). Pierce, not by conincidence, is also the developer of Drafts. x-callback-url is something that developers can freely implement into the built-in URL schemes of their apps to allow them to send a “success” parameter after completing a certain action. It is very similar to an “if, then” statement in other programming languages. When you run an action for an app that supports x-callback-url, you can tell the app to run a second action once the first action has been completed. This is by far the most important aspect of iOS automation. Without x-callback-url, advanced iOS automation would be impossible.\n\nGoing back to the Drafts URL scheme, it’s very important not to forget to add “x-callback-url\/” to the end of the top level Drafts URL. The beginning of any Drafts action you ever build should be `drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/`. Adding that line will enable you to later add the rest of the x-callback parameters, which are essential to chaining your actions together. Even if you’re building a simple action with no chaining, it’s best to just include “x-callback-url\/” in every action you build so that you never forget it when it’s necessary, and because it’s simply considered good form.\n\nNow, back to the second level of the Drafts URL scheme (technically the third after “x-callback-url\/”, but I just count that as part of the top level since it should be included in every Drafts action you ever build). We can ignore “import_action?”, as its only function is to import new Drafts actions. This direction is used to automatically install new actions from links, something which is important to sharing actions, but for building actions it is not very useful at all. So we will continue with the URL `drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?`. If you run that action in your web browser right now, in the same manner as you did with “drafts:\/\/” earlier, then no matter what your setting for creating a new draft on launch, when iOS jumps you out of the browser and over to Drafts, a new, blank draft will be opened for you, automatically. Try that, if you’d like. Then come back here.\n\nSo far we’ve reached the second level of the Drafts URL scheme, and we’ve chosen the far more versatile “create?” route. Continuing up this route, Drafts now only supports one direction, adding “text=” to our URL. That leaves us with `drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=`. Following “text=” will be whatever text with which we wish to populate the new draft our action is creating. The annoying part about adding this text is that it has to be hard-coded into the action, and that means it also has to be [percent-encoded](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Percent-encoding). For an easy example, we’ll make our new draft simply say “Hello World”. To percent-encode “Hello World”, you only have to change the space to a “%20”. The final output, as we continue to add to our URL action, will be `drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=Hello%20World`. Run that action through your web browser now to see a new draft opened in Drafts with the text “Hello World” already written into it.\n\n![](Automating%20iOS%20A%20Comprehensive%20Guide%20to%20URL%20Schemes%20and%20Drafts%20Actions\/2013-11-07%252007-47-24%2520PM-drafts_guide-iPadGIF2.gif)\nDrafts for iOS \n\nLet’s recap what’s happening in this URL. Since iOS recognizes the steps in a URL action in order, as they come, our action in its current form is already doing four things:\n\n* `drafts:\/\/` tells iOS to open Drafts.\n* `x-callback-url\/` tells Drafts to enable its built in x-callback parameters. (We’ll get to those later.)\n* `create?` Tells Drafts to create a new draft.\n* `text=Hello%20World` tells Drafts to populate that new draft with the words “Hello World”.\n\nSo now we have a new draft in Drafts which says Hello World. Let’s say we now want to tweet that text. At this point we are already in Drafts with the draft containing the text we want to tweet open, so technically we could just open our action list in Drafts and press the tweet button and be done. However, iOS automation is all about skipping steps, and we’ve just reached the point where we can skip our first step. Instead of having to open our action list, find the tweet action and press it, we can just add a few words to our URL and tell Drafts to run that action on our new draft automatically. To do this, we must continue to the next level of the Drafts URL scheme: “&action=”. As you can probably guess, following that equal sign will be the title of the action we wish to run on our draft. Since, for our example, we are trying to tweet “Hello World”, our action will be “Tweet: username”. This is where the action becomes different for all of us.\n\nIn Drafts, each Tweet action is in the format of “Tweet: username”, where “username” is whatever your Twitter username is for the account you wish to tweet from. This is something to always keep in mind when sharing actions you create. If you call another action, you have to make sure that anyone you share your action with has that same action in their own action list, with the same title. Otherwise your action will do nothing. So for me, I will be using “Tweet: the_axx” in our example. Once again, however, we have to use percent-encoding, this time for our action title. A colon is percent-encoded to “%3A”, and a space is still “%20”. Our final output will be `drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=Hello%20World&action=Tweet%3A%20the_axx`. For you, of course, “the_axx” will be whatever your own Twitter username is.\n\nNow our action is finally an action. A very simple action, but still an action. In fact, the action we just built is an exact recreation of what would happen if we ran the built-in Tweet action on a draft with the text “Hello World”. This is one of the basic building block actions which I mentioned at the beginning. We can combine this action with others in order to first Tweet “Hello World”, then perform a different action on a different draft with the same text. All we have to do is chain the actions together.\n\nAs I discussed earlier, we cannot run two actions at once. Nor can we run multiple actions on the same draft. We have to run one first, then use an x-callback parameter to tell Drafts to automatically create a new draft, with the same text as the first, and run the next action on that draft once the first action has finished. There are four x-callback parameters: x-source, x-success, x-error and x-cancel. Here I will only touch on x-success, and a little bit on x-cancel. You can read about the other two at [the x-callback-url website](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/).\n\nAdding the x-success parameter into your Drafts URL action tells Drafts to perform the next action upon the success of the first one. That is, once the first action is completed, the next one will be run. Since this depends upon the success of the first action, remember that your second action will never be run if the first one fails. This is why testing and re-testing each part of your URL actions is important. Your second action could be typed up perfectly, but if the first one has a slight error that causes it to fail, the second will never get a chance.\n\nGoing back to our URL action, we now have to add the next portion of the Drafts URL scheme, “&x-success=”, in order to chain a second action. Here’s what we’ll end up with: `drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=Hello%20World&action=Tweet%3A%20the_axx&x-success=`. Our action is now doing six tasks:\n\n* `drafts:\/\/` tells iOS to open Drafts.\n* `x-callback-url\/` tells Drafts to enable its built in x-callback parameters. (We’ll get to those later.)\n* `create?` Tells Drafts to create a new draft.\n* `text=Hello%20World` tells Drafts to populate that new draft with the words “Hello World”.\n* `&action=\"Tweet%3A%20the_axx` runs the built-in “Tweet: the_axx” action and posts “Hello World” to my Twitter account.\n* `&x-success=` tells Drafts that once it successfully tweets “Hello World”, it will then perform another action.\n\nNow you have to build your second action. This should be pretty simple, because it is exactly the same as your first, except for the final line where you specify the next action. Use all the pieces of a Drafts URL action that you just learned to create this secondary action: `drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=Hello%20World&action=Post%20to%20App.net`. The breakdown for this action should look pretty familiar:\n\n* `drafts:\/\/` tells iOS to open Drafts.\n* `x-callback-url\/` tells Drafts to enable its built in x-callback parameters. (We’ll get to those later.)\n* `create?` Tells Drafts to create a new draft.\n* `text=Hello%20World` tells Drafts to populate that new draft with the words “Hello World”.\n* `&action=Post%20to%20App.net` runs the built in “Post to App.net” action, and posts “Hello World” to your App.net account.\n\nNow you’re almost done. There is just one final step: the second action within your action, the one you type in after “&x-success=”, must be percent-encoded. To percent-encode that entire string by hand would be an incredibly annoying and difficult process. Luckily for us, Drafts has come to our rescue. Drafts has a fantastic feature in that any time you want to percent-encode a portion of your action, you can simply surround that portion with {{double curly brackets}}. So instead of encoding that entire second action, you can instead just surround it with double curly brackets, therefore adding `{{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=Hello%20World&action=Post%20to%20App.net}}` to the end of your x-success parameter. In fact, you can use this method for earlier parts of your action, too. Instead of “Hello%20World”, you could type “{{Hello World}}”, and instead of “Tweet%3A%20the_axx” you could type “{{Tweet: the_axx}}”.\n\nHowever, there’s one important thing to note regarding the encoding of your second action. The text you are running your next action on, and action you are specifying to run on it, in the second action in your chain actually have to be *double encoded*. This is best understood by thinking of your second action as how it would have to be if you ran it in place of the first action: the text and action to run in your first action have to be encoded already. When you take that and use it as a second action, the entire thing has to be encoded. Thus, the parts that were already encoded are now double encoded. This can get pretty confusing, but using the curly bracket wrappers can keep it so you still only have to encode them once by hand (there are a variety of ways to automate the encoding of these pieces of your action. Those will be discussed later in this article), then use the curly brackets to encode them the second time automatically (using curly brackets within curly brackets to double encode doesn’t work. I’ve tried it).\n\nThat’s it! Here’s the final output of your first Drafts URL action which, when run, will tweet “Hello World”, then chain back and post “Hello Word” to App.net:\n\n>   \n```\ndrafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text={{Hello World}}&action={{Tweet: the_axx}}&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=Hello%20World&action=Post%20to%20App.net}}\n```\n\nCongratulations again, you now have the knowledge to build *any* complex Drafts URL action, because *every* complex Drafts URL action is built in the same format: `[First Action]&x-success={{[Second Action]}}`. Since you now understand the hierarchy of the Drafts URL scheme, your options on what actions to chain together are limitless. Even chaining more than two actions together is possible using the same logic with a few extra tricks, but we’ll get to that later. First off, there’s one last aspect of Drafts that you need to learn before you can graduate from the beginner portion of this tutorial: variable tags.\n\nIn the last section, you learned how to leverage the Drafts URL scheme in order to build a basic Drafts action, then you learned how to chain two of these actions together to create a complex action. There was one huge annoyance though: you had to hard-code the text you wanted to run the action on into the action itself. This limits any action you ever make to only work for the same words, unless you change the action’s code. If this was all you could do with actions, they would be basically useless. Luckily, Drafts has come to our rescue once again. Drafts supports a versatile variety of `[[variable tags]]`. These tags, words wrapped in [[double brackets]] and placed within your URL actions, draw text from various places within whatever draft you run the action on. Better yet, this text is automatically percent-encoded, without you having to do anything. Here are the main tags which you will likely use the most:\n\n* `[[draft]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the entire contents of your draft.\n* `[[title]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of only the first line of your draft.\n* `[[body]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of everything *except* the first line of your draft.\n* `[[clipboard]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of the iOS system clipboard at the time the action is run.\n* `[[line|n]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of only one line in your draft. You choose which line by changing the “n” in the tag to a number.\n* `[[line|n..]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of everything except the lines above the number you specify with the “n”. It’s very similar to the `[[body]]` tag, except you choose the line to begin from. (So, for instance, `[[line|4..]]` would be replaced by every line in your current draft after the fourth line, including the fourth line itself.)\n* `[[line|..n]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of the first line of your draft all the way to the nth line of your draft. You choose the line by replacing the “n” with a number. (So `[[line|..4]]` would be replaced by only the first four lines of your draft.)\n* `[[line|a..b]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of a range of lines between “a” and “b”, where you replace “a” and “b” with two different numbers. (So `[[line|2..4]]` would be replaced by the second, third and fourth lines of your draft.)\n* `[[Selection]]` is replaced, when you run your action, by the contents of the last selection of text used when editing the current draft. If there was no selection, it is replaced by the contents of the entire draft.\n\nThere are also tags to draw the current date or time, and a few others, but I won’t get into those here. You can find a list of all available variable tags in the “Tag Help” section of any of the custom action creation pages in Drafts.\n\nThe above listed tags are extremely important to creating complex workflows with Drafts. In our initial example action, we could change `Hello%20World` to `[[draft]]` in both our first and second actions. Then we could type up a 140 character or less draft and run our Cross Post action on it. The result would be that anything we typed would be tweeted, then posted to App.net. Since we didn’t hard-code the text into the action, we could use that action again and again on any draft we wanted to cross post. In fact, that is exactly what the actual Cross Post action I designed and have had on my site for months does. The code for that action is exactly what we just wrote, except it uses the `[[draft]]` tag. Here it is, completed (the order of Post to App.net and Tweet: the_axx does not matter):\n\n>   \n```\ndrafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action={{Post to App.net}}&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action=Tweet%3A%20the_axx}}\n```\n\nWe could change `[[draft]]` in either of those actions to `[[title]]` to tweet or post only the first line of our draft, or we could change them to `[[body]]` to tweet or post everything except the first line. I leave it as `[[draft]]` because tweeting and posting to App.net are both pretty straightforward actions, and usually you wouldn’t have any other text before or after the text you want to tweet and post in your draft.\n\nIf you wanted to make it a little more interesting, you could change the text for the Post to App.net action to `[[body]]` and the text for the tweet action to `[[title]]`. Then you could type a 140 character version of your post in the first line, and a 256 character version in the second line. Running the action would first post the 140 character version to Twitter, then chain back and post your longer version to App.net, which is less restrictive than Twitter. This is an easy example of the clever ways in which you can use different `[[variable tag]]` combinations to simplify complex processes.\n\nNow that you can understand and write a basic Drafts action URL, chain it to a second action with the x-success parameter and choose what text from your draft is used in the action by picking the proper variable tag, you’re ready to move to the next level.\n\n## Making Drafts Useful\n\nOnce you’ve mastered building a Drafts action, and chaining together two actions, the next step is to figure out the best ways in which Drafts can be useful to you, personally. For this, you need to evaluate your workflows. A workflow can be anything you do on your iOS device which involves text and requires more than one step. You’re looking for any possible way that Drafts can eliminate monotonous extra steps that you have to repeat frequently. You’re looking to optimize.\n\nContinuing with our example action, for me Cross Post optimized a fairly simple workflow which I was having to perform often: posting to both Twitter and App.net. Previously, I had to find and open Tweetbot, wait for it to load, press the compose button, type in the tweet, select all the text and copy it, post the tweet, leave [Tweetbot](http:\/\/tapbots.com\/software\/tweetbot\/), find and open [Felix](http:\/\/tigerbears.com\/felix\/), wait for it to load, press the compose button, paste in the text and post it. Overall, the process was annoying and overly time-consuming. By creating the Cross Post action, I reduced the workflow to this: open Drafts (I keep it in my dock so I never have to take extra time locating it, or even swipe to a different page), press the plus button for a new draft (if you have Drafts set to create a new draft upon opening, even this step is unnecessary), type my tweet\/post, open my action list and press Cross Post. The whole process, not including the time to compose a post, takes about five seconds. This is a workflow I use every day, often multiple times per day.[❲1❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts\/#fn:1)\n\nWhere Drafts really shines, however, is when using some of its other types of built-in custom actions to simplify your workflows. Drafts support five types of actions: Dropbox actions, Evernote actions, Email actions, Message actions, and URL actions. We’ve already discussed URL actions, but the other four types of actions can be very useful as well, particularly so when combined with URL actions.\n\n## Dropbox Actions\n\nIf you ever upload text files to Dropbox, Drafts has an awesome template system to improve this process on iOS. In each custom action you can specify the path to save the file to, the file name (you can use a time stamp, the first line of the draft or a predefined file name of your choice), the extension, whether to create a new file or append or prepend to an already existing file, and a template for the text you’re uploading. The template can use all of the aforementioned variable tags, as well as other text that you may want to hard-code into each upload to format your file in any way you wish. The file name section can also make use of variable tags, so you can create more complex names, such as combining the first line of your draft with a date or time stamp.\n\nOnce you’ve created your Dropbox action, you can type up a draft in the proper format for the template you created and run the action on it to upload the draft to Dropbox exactly as you want it, exactly where you want it. You can create an unlimited number of these actions, each in any way you want.\n\n## Evernote Actions\n\nEvernote actions work in a very similar manner to Dropbox actions. You can specify the title of an Evernote note, the Notebook to place it in, the tags to add to it, whether to create a new note or append or prepend to an existing one, the template for the note, and even whether to send the note as Markdown HTML.[❲2❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts\/#fn:2)\n\nJust as with Dropbox actions, once you’ve created your Evernote action in the way you want it, just run it on a draft properly formatted to fit your template and the note will be automatically sent to Evernote. Also as with Dropbox actions, you can use all `[[variable tags]]` in the template and title fields, and you can make an unlimited number of Evernote actions.\n\n## Email Actions\n\nFor custom email actions, you can specify the To, CC, BCC, Subject, and Body areas of your email. As usual, you can use the `[[variable tags]]` to do so, and build an email action any way you want. Just as with Evernote actions, you can send your email as Markdown formatted HTML.\n\nOnce you’ve created your action, run it on a properly formatted draft, and that’s it. No limits on how many of these you can build, either.\n\n## Message Actions\n\nMessage actions are a bit more simple. You can specify the recipient for the message and the template, using `[[variable tags]]`, to send messages in the format you want to the people you want to.\n\nAfter creating your action, run it on your properly formatted draft to send it to the specified recipients. You can build as many of these as you want also, although I personally have never found them to be incredibly useful. I prefer to use Launch Center Pro for shortcuts to texting friends.\n\n## URL Actions: The Glue Tying Everything Together\n\nEvery type of custom action in Drafts supports x-callback-url. This means that all of them can be chained together in any way you wish. Automating workflows is a quick and easy task once you know the basic Drafts URL scheme. You can take the exact action which we used for Cross Post, but replace `{{Post to App.net}}` and `tweet%3A%20the_axx` with titles of your other custom actions to chain them together instead.[❲3❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts\/#fn:3)\n\nYou can also combine the template action types with the original actions we discussed. Perhaps you want to keep an Evernote note or a Dropbox file with a list of all of your tweets or App.net posts. Building a workflow to first post to Twitter or App.net, then append or prepend to a running Dropbox file or Evernote note is as easy as building the custom action template for prepending the file, then chaining that to your tweet or Post to App.net action. As you can see, once you understand the basic layout of Drafts URL actions, chaining any two actions from your action list together is extremely simple.\n\nGetting started with Drafts can be a long process. Once you’ve learned everything I’ve described above, you still have to take the time to evaluate your text-related iOS workflows, figure out which ones can be automated, then build the actions necessary to automate them. Even though this can take quite some time, I find the end result very rewarding.\n\n## Other App URL Schemes, and Adding Them Into Your Workflows\n\nIt’s quite likely that some of your workflows will make use of apps which Drafts does not have built in support for. For some of these, automation will simply not be possible. There are, however, a constantly increasing number of apps which also support x-callback-url.[❲4❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts\/#fn:4)\n\nEach app which supports x-callback-url will have a URL scheme that differs from that of Drafts, but as long as you understand the Drafts URL scheme, you should be able to read about and figure out the schemes of the other apps you need for your workflows as well. The majority of them will have the same beginning format: `yourapp:\/\/x-callback-url\/`. After that, however, they will likely branch off in a different direction from Drafts. You should be able to find the information about your app’s URL scheme through the link above, as long as you are searching for an app which does support x-callback-url.\n\nWhen adding third party apps into your Drafts workflows, the actions for them will not begin with `drafts:\/\/`. You will have to add them as their own custom URL actions, which will use URLs pertaining to the app’s own URL scheme. For example, a popular calendar app, [Fantastical](http:\/\/flexibits.com\/fantastical-iphone), supports x-callback-url for event creation. You can create an action in your Drafts action list which will send your current draft to Fantastical to be parsed and added as an event. Running the action will launch you out of Drafts and into Fantastical, where it will automatically parse your text. Then you can set up an x-success parameter to take you back to Drafts when the event is created. After running the action, when you’re satisfied with the event and ready to create it, just press the “Add” button in Fantastical. This will add it to your calendar as well as triggering the x-success parameter and sending you back to Drafts.\n\nThe Drafts URL action for something like this follows the Fantastical URL scheme instead of the Drafts scheme that we learned earlier. It would look like this:\n\n>   \n```\nfantastical2:\/\/x-callback-url\/parse?sentence=[[draft]]&x-success={{drafts:\/\/}}\n```\n\nNotice that even though we start with Fantastical this time, the layout for the chained action is the exact same as when we linked the two Drafts actions: `[First Action]&x-success={{[Second Action]}}`. This time it just happens that our first action is a Fantastical action instead of a Drafts one.\n\nHere’s the breakdown of the Fantastical action. You’ll notice it is very similar to the Drafts URL scheme, just with some differences in words:\n\n* `fantastical2:\/\/` tells iOS to open Fantastical (the “2” was added to the URL scheme for Fantastical 2 because it was released as a whole new app instead of an update to the original Fantastical).\n* `x-callback-url\/` tells Fantastical to enable its built in x-callback parameters.\n* `parse?` tells Fantastical to prepare to parse a new event (the app’s version of the “create?” function from the Drafts URL scheme).\n* `sentence=[[draft]]` is a special case. Fantastical cannot understand `[[draft]]`. If you were to run this action through a web browser, Fantastical would create a calendar event out of the text “[[draft]]”, which would be useless. However, we are creating and running this action *from* Drafts. When Drafts sees `[[draft]]` it immediately replaces the tag with the contents of your draft, percent-encoded. So when the URL reaches Fantastical, it would actually be seeing something along the lines of “Meeting on Monday at 10” (assuming you typed a sentence which Fantastical is actually able to parse). It would then take this sentence and parse it into a calendar event titled “Meeting” on the next Monday at 10AM.\n* `&x-success=` tells Fantastical that once you tap the “Add” button it will then perform another action.\n* `{{drafts:\/\/}}` is the action that Fantastical then performs, which in turn tells iOS to launch Drafts, returning you to your original position (the one time x-callback-url is never really used in a URL action is when you are simply trying to open the app and don’t want anything more to happen).\n\nThis is the basic manner in which all URL actions work, Drafts or not, as long as they are x-callback actions. Actions for apps without x-callback capabilities are even simpler, as you can remove the x-callback-url and the x-success parameters, leaving only the simple, basic action.\n\nRunning third party (non-Drafts) actions through the Drafts action list allows you to make use of the awesome Drafts `[[variable tags]]` for use in the actions. These can become incredibly important when building more advanced workflows that chain together multiple apps.\n\n## Running actions with JavaScript\n\nIf any of your workflows necessitate data from web pages, such as URLs, titles of pages or quotes from pages, you can create JavaScript bookmarklets which automatically create a new Draft with this data. I won’t go into detail on this here, as it does require some knowledge of JavaScript, and I’m not teaching that in this article. However, if you are interested, Federico has quite a few examples of this type of workflow in [his old review of Drafts 2.5](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/ios-automation-and-workflows-with-drafts\/), and you can also find more [throughout other MacStories articles.](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/bookmarklet)\n\n## Tips and Warnings\n\nThere are a few errors that I have run into many times while making URL actions, and a few tips I have learned to think about after making them. Hopefully by reading them you can avoid making some of the same mistakes.\n\nWhen chaining two Drafts actions together, don’t forget the `[First Action]&x-success={{[Second Action]}}` template design. I have often found myself trying to run an action that ends simply with `&x-success=Post%20to%20App.net` or something like that. It always seems foolish when I realize the error, but I still make it every once in a while. When you are chaining together two actions which begin the same way, and differ only in the action title at the end, it’s easy to forget that you still have to declare the beginning part of the URL twice, even though it is completely identical to the first one.\n\nDon’t forget the second set of curly brackets at the back of a chained action. Between typing the first set “{{” and writing out the entire action I want to chain, I often forget to place the second set of brackets “}}” at the very end of my action. When you forget this second set, your action will error out with no explanation, and this can get very confusing when the entire action is written correctly, and the only error is forgetting those last two brackets.\n\nA tip this time. When writing URL actions, think of the “text=” section as a template for your draft. You can use “%0A”, the percent-encoded version of a line break (or pressing the return button once), or “%20”, the percent-encoded version of a space, sandwiched between one [[variable tag]] and some hard coded words to put together a pre-formatted draft after running an action. An example: if every time you post to your blog you then compose a tweet formatted something like “New post: [URL of the post]”, you could design an action in which you simply paste in the URL of your new post and run the action and it automatically composes your tweet in the form of “New post: [[draft]]” where `[[draft]]` would be the URL. For this, the part of your action after “text=” would be `New%20Post%3A%20[[draft]]`. That would be the template for your tweet. One place I use this type of template building frequently is when drawing info from websites through JavaScript bookmarklets. By making your action a template you can create a new draft with the the webpage title in the first line and the URL in the second, or both in the first line but with a space between them, etc. When thinking about your workflows, always look for places where you use the same title or other text every time you do something. These are the things you can hard-code into your actions to save even more time.\n\nWhen encoding actions, or pieces of actions, you can use tools like [Launch Center Pro](http:\/\/contrast.co\/launch-center-pro\/) to percent-encode, or even decode text. If you don’t want to leave Drafts, and don’t care about decoding, you could also run a quick action in Drafts which makes use of Drafts’ {{curly bracket}} tools to encode things. All you need to do is copy the text you want encoded to your clipboard (preferably cut it to the clipboard, so it’s out of the draft), then run the action to have the contents of the clipboard percent-encoded. This action will preserve all of an open draft, so if you’re building a URL action in your draft, but need a piece encoded, just type out the piece normally, cut it to the clipboard, and run the action. The action will percent-encode the contents of your clipboard, then finish by creating a new draft with the exact contents you had in the old one. After the action runs you can paste the now encoded text where you want it and continue building your action. Here’s the action:\n\n>   \n```\ndrafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text={{[[clipboard]]}}&action={{Copy to Clipboard}}&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]}}\n```\n\n[Direct Import Link for Encode Clipboard action](drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/import_action?type=URL&amp;name=Encode%20Clipboard&amp;url=drafts%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2Fcreate%3Ftext%3D%7B%7B%5B%5Bclipboard%5D%5D%7D%7D%26action%3D%7B%7BCopy%20to%20Clipboard%7D%7D%26x-success%3D%7B%7Bdrafts%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2Fcreate%3Ftext%3D%5B%5Bdraft%5D%5D%7D%7D)\n\nWhen using the `[[line|n]]` tags, don’t forget that Drafts counts each line as any amount of text until a line break. If you have actually written an entire paragraph before hitting return, the `[[line|1]]` variable will be replaced, when the action is run, by that entire paragraph. `[[line|2]]`, in the same manner, takes all of the text between the first and and second line breaks in your draft. The `[[title]]` variable works the same way. In fact, there’s no difference between `[[line|1]]` and `[[title]]`.\n\nThe first thing Drafts does when you run an action is replace all variable tags with the corresponding variables. It is important to remember that this happens before anything else. Since all variables are filled in before any piece of your action is run, you cannot change the text of a variable between the first and second actions of a chained action. This is mostly notable in regard to the `[[clipboard]]` tag. A common error is to think that if your first action copies your text to the clipboard, and the action you chained to it utilizes the `[[clipboard]]` variable, then whatever was copied in the first action will be what is used as `[[clipboard]]` in the second action. In reality, Drafts will draw whatever is in your clipboard *before* you run the actions, which can end in a very confusing result when the action completes, having used text from something you were doing earlier which you have no idea how it accessed. This issue can be solved by splitting the action into two different actions. The first action will copy your text to the clipboard, then chain back with x-success to call the second action which uses that new clipboard text. As of Drafts 3.5, however, it’s usually easier to just break up your draft using `[[line|a..b]]` tags instead of copying pieces to the clipboard. In previous versions, when the `[[variable tag]]` possibilities were far more limited, we had to use hacks like putting pieces into the clipboard quite often, but they are mostly no longer necessary. In case you do need it, however, the above can still be helpful. I use it in a few of my more complex and lengthy action sequences.\n\n## Tips and Tricks for Building Expert Workflows\n\nIf you’re a beginner, and all you know about iOS automation and building URL schemes is what you just read, you may want to go practice all of that and get the basics down before continuing here. The methods described below can become pretty confusing and difficult to manage correctly.\n\n### Chaining Three or More Actions in One Sequence\n\nOnce you’ve mastered chaining together two URL actions, chaining three or more together to begin building some really complex workflows is actually quite easy, you just have to know a few tricks.\n\nThe instinct would probably be to add another “&x-success=” onto the back of your two-action chain, with a third action placed behind it. Theoretically this would work, but in practice Drafts gets a bit confused by this, and I’ve never been able to get something like it to work. Even if it would work, it would probably end up being more trouble than it’s worth, as the third action would have to be *triple encoded*, which gets disorienting and is ultimately way too much work.\n\nThe best way I’ve found to chain three or more actions is to use groupings of two at a time with a “shell” action to connect them. I’ll use my Triple Cross Post action as an example. Triple Cross Post posts a draft to Twitter and App.net, just like the Cross Post action, but then adds in a third service: posting the same draft to Facebook. The first step to building this action is to break it down into sets of two of the simple, building block actions which we create it from. A triple cross post will use three basic actions: Post to App.net, Tweet: the_axx (it will, once again, need to be changed to your own username to work for you), and Post to Facebook. Grouping them into pairs, we’re left with one pair and one lone action. Now you build an individual action out of the pair. We already built the action earlier in this article, the Cross Post action:\n\n>   \n```\ndrafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action={{Post to App.net}}&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action=Tweet%3A%20the_axx}}\n```\n\nSince the second set is only a single action, we don’t need to build a new action out of it. Now we combine our three actions with one “shell” action. The shell is in the same format as any chained action: `[First Action]&x-success={{[Second Action]}}`. This time, however, our second action is already a chained action, we are calling the Cross Post action. Here’s the URL:\n\n>   \n```\ndrafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action={{Post to Facebook}}&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[draft]]&action=Cross%20Post}}\n```\n\nWhen Drafts sees this, it runs the first action normally, posting your draft to Facebook. Once Drafts gets to the second action, the first action ends and it jumps into the Cross Post action: posting your draft to App.net and then Twitter. I think of it as if Drafts is “unwrapping” the second action. Instead of trying to chain three together in one, we just nest a chained action inside of a chained action.\n\nThis same strategy can be used to chain more than three actions together as well. Just keep nesting chained actions inside of chained actions. Note that sometimes Drafts has an issue with rushing through actions. That is, if you nest two chained actions in one shell action, it sometimes goes too fast for the first one to unwrap, and skips portions of your action. If you look at my [Drafts Stress Test](http:\/\/theaxx.net\/drafts-stress-test) actions, you can see that I got around this by using a few more shell actions than would have been necessary in order to never nest more than one double action in another. I connected everything with smaller “continueTest” actions, which just grabbed the `[[draft]]` text and sent it into the next shell. Still, I encourage you to at least attempt nesting two chained actions in one shell if your workflow requires it, as it often does actually work, and would save you time building unnecessary extra actions.[❲5❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts\/#fn:5) I’ve never been able to figure out exactly what causes the bug to occur, but sometimes it does and other times it doesn’t, so you’re stuck with guessing and checking for now.\n\nAs you can see, when trying to make long chains like this, things can get very confusing. Obviously, an action chain as huge as my stress test is impractical. I was simply trying to test Drafts’ limits, but you could definitely build some useful chains which, while likely less than twenty five actions, are still more than three. These methods can be useful to remember when your chain does not work for unidentifiable reasons. Sometimes your code is perfect, but you have to work around the app making some mistakes.\n\n### Chopping a Draft\n\nOne of the most useful advanced techniques I’ve come up with is what I call “chopping” a draft. This is a process you can use when dealing with lists of data, when you want to perform the same action on different lines of text. Rather than typing each line in an individual draft and manually running the action on them one by one, you can use this technique to automate the process.\n\nMy favorite examples of this process in action are my [Import actions](http:\/\/unapologetic.io\/posts\/2013\/10\/26\/the-import-actions\/), which can take an infinitely long list of action titles and URLs and automatically import them one by one, and my [Parse In Fantastical Action](http:\/\/unapologetic.io\/posts\/2013\/10\/28\/the-parse-in-fantastical-action\/), which can take an infinitely long list of events to parse in Fantastical and automatically parse them one by one.\n\nI’ll use the Parse In Fantastical action for this example, as it’s more useful to a wider audience. The Parse In Fantastical action found in the link above is the simplified version. However, since this is the expert section, and the more complex version better displays the usefulness of chopping your draft, I’ll use it (I never actually posted this version to The Axx or [Unapologetic](http:\/\/unapologetic.io\/) ). The more complex version of the Parse In Fantastical action not only parses a new event in Fantastical, but also adds a note to the event. To run the action, your list has to have each event and corresponding note placed in pairs of two lines, with a completely blank like between each pair.\n\nIn order for Drafts to send a line of text to Fantastical to be parsed, that line must be isolated. We can isolate the first line, our first event, with the `[[line|1]]` tag (or the `[[title]]` tag), and the second line, the note for our first event, with the `[[line|2]]` tag. We can use both of these variables in an action to parse a single event and note in Fantastical. The most important part of the process, however, is to make sure not to lose the thread of the rest of your list. Remember that the `[[line|4..]]` tag in Drafts will take all of the text in a draft from the fourth line to the end. We make use of this to drag the rest of the list along with us as we parse each individual piece. Even though our first action focuses only on the first two lines, we can place `[[line|4..]]` in the chained action so that it is saved even when we jump over to Fantastical.[❲6❳](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tutorials\/guide-url-scheme-ios-drafts\/#fn:6) Here is the Parse In Fantastical action, including a notes parameter:\n\n>   \n```\nfantastical2:\/\/x-callback-url\/parse?sentence=[[line|1]]&notes=[[line|2]]&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[line|4..]]&action=Parse%20In%20Fantastical}}&x-cancel={{drafts:\/\/}}\n```\n\nAs you can see, with the first action in our chain we isolate the first two lines with the [[line|1]] and [[line|2]] tags and send them to Fantastical to be parsed and added as a note. Since Drafts fills in all of the variables at the beginning, we can use the `[[line|4..]]` tag in our second action so that when Fantastical finishes its part and jumps back to Drafts, the rest of our list is waiting for us. I call this process “chopping” because we effectively just chopped the first two lines of our draft out while maintaining the rest of our list. Now, with the x-success parameter, we chain the action back to itself, running “Parse In Fantastical” once again. Since we used `[[line|4..]]`, our new draft has our entire list, starting with the fourth line of the first list, which is the first parameter for our second event. Running the same action now chops the two lines for this second event out, returns to Fantastical and parses them for a second event and note. This process will continue for every pair of items in your list, and since the third line is never used, it just gets left behind entirely each time the action is looped, like it never existed at all.\n\nDropping that third line is an ability that can be manifested as both an advantage or an error. In this case we utilize our ability to leave a line behind to allow us to have a blank line between each pair of parameters when typing them in Drafts. This makes the data we’re sending to Fantastical much more readable so that we can review it quickly before running the action. On the other hand, you must be very careful when dealing with variable tags line by line, because if you leave a gap between line numbers in your variables that is either in the wrong place or shouldn’t be there at all, you could end up losing data or sending parameters to your actions in the wrong order.\n\nOne last thing. You may have noticed that the first Fantastical action includes an x-cancel parameter at the end. This is another one of the x-callback-url parameters. You already know that the x-success parameter allows you to run another action if the first action successfully completes. What x-cancel does is fairly self explanatory as well: it runs another action if the first action is canceled. Being canceled can take a variety of different forms depending on which app you are running an action from. In Fantastical’s case, it’s pretty straightforward: if we press the “Cancel” button on an event instead of the “Add” button, it will run the URL action we have set to the x-cancel parameter, instead of the one set to x-success. Since our action will run indefinitely if we don’t cancel it, this is how the sequence comes to an end. When our list runs out of events, Fantastical will still be opened once more, this time it will just be blank though, because there is no list items to parse. At this point you just hit the cancel button and Fantastical will run the x-cancel action instead of the x-success action. We set x-cancel to `drafts:\/\/`, so we will return to Drafts, the loop ended and the workflow completed.\n\nUsing this “chopping” strategy, it’s possible to run any type of action you want on any list you want. You just need to make sure your list is formatted properly and that your `[[line|n..]]` tag uses the correct line number so that when you chop the next piece of your draft, the first line is the first parameter you need for your action. With simpler action sequences, you may only need a parameter to draw the first line of your draft. In this case, you could bring the rest of your list along with either the `[[body]]` or `[[line|2..]]` tags, as they both perform the same functions.\n\nThis brings us to my next tip, thinking of your chains and sequences as threads.\n\n### Think of Long Action Sequences as a Thread\n\nThe best way I can describe how to build action sequences which chain more than three or four actions together, or how to make sure your chopping methods are going to work correctly, is to think of every action sequence as a thread.\n\nIn my Drafts Stress Test I chained together 25 actions across 7 apps and 8 services, all using the same text that I started with at the very beginning. Building this massive chain was only possible by imagining it all as a thread. Each time Drafts got to the end of one action and unwrapped the next one, I had to be sure not to lose the thread of my text. The `[[draft]]` variable had to stay the same throughout the entire process. This works similarly with chopping: if your actions are pulling different pieces of text out of the same overall draft, you have to be sure to preserve the main text throughout each action. In the Parse In Fantastical example I used above, we had to make sure each action included `[[line|4..]]` in the x-success parameter so that we didn’t lose the rest of our list as we jumped through actions. This example also displays a possible complication: you have to make completely sure you use all the correct tags to pull the info you want through the thread, because the error of being a single digit off can cause you to lose a vital part of your next action. This error in the batch parse action could result with your notes being set as the event info and the event info being set as the notes, which would waste tons of time instead of saving it like all this is supposed to.\n\nThinking of your actions as a thread is the best solution I can offer to avoid these possible pitfalls. Laying every action in a sequence you’re building out in a draft so you can read through them before importing and visualize that thread as your text is passed from action to action is the best way to prevent yourself from having critical errors in your workflows.\n\n### Using the “allowEmpty” Paramter\n\nThe latest version of Drafts includes an optional “allowEmpty” parameter. You can add “&allowEmpty=NO” to any URL action to stop it from running when it encounters a blank draft. This is primarily of use in regard to stopping infinite loops from continuing when you have chopped out all of your content and reached the end of a Draft. In our Parse In Fantastical action from above, to stop the action once all our events have been added we have to allow Drafts to send us to Fantastical one last time with a blank argument, then manually hit “Cancel” in Fantastical in order to break our loop and return to Drafts. By adding in an allowEmpty parameter we can circumvent this final step by stopping Drafts before it sends the blank argument to Fantastical.\n\nThe trick to allowEmpty is knowing where to place it inside of your URL action. It won’t cause an error to place it at the very end after everything else like this:\n\n>   \n```\nfantastical2:\/\/x-callback-url\/parse?sentence=[[line|1]]&notes=[[line|2]]&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[line|3..]]&action=Parse%20In%20Fantastical}}&x-cancel={{drafts:\/\/}}&allowEmpty=NO\n```\n\nHowever, placing it there will still allow Drafts to send you to Fantastical one final time with an empty argument. Instead, place it in the middle, after your now blank draft has been created, but before you run the Parse In Fantastical action on it:\n\n>   \n```\nfantastical2:\/\/x-callback-url\/parse?sentence=[[line|1]]&notes=[[line|2]]&x-success={{drafts:\/\/x-callback-url\/create?text=[[line|3..]]&allowEmpty=NO&action=Parse%20In%20Fantastical}}&x-cancel={{drafts:\/\/}}\n```\n\nDrafts follows actions step by step, so with this format it will first send your text to Fantastical, then upon successfully creating the event return to Drafts. Next, a new draft will be created using whatever text was left over in the third line of your draft and further. Now Drafts checks to see if there is any text in the draft. If there is, the action chains back to itself and runs again, but as soon as there is no more text remaining, the allowEmpty parameter is triggered, and since it is set to NO, the following action is canceled instead of being run. The sequence ends inside of Drafts without requiring you to hit cancel again in Fantastical.\n\nWith allowEmpty, the x-cancel parameter may seem useless, but I would still include it in the action in case you decide to cancel the sequence in the middle before all of the events have been imported. That way you will still end up back in Drafts where you started.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf I’ve succeeded with this post, and you started reading it with no prior knowledge of building URL actions, you should now know enough to start building your own advanced URL action workflows. It will probably still take some practice to really get the skills down, but I hope you’ve found this to be an excellent place to get up to speed on the subject. You can check out my new website, [Unapologetic](http:\/\/unapologetic.io\/), and select “Automation” in the view controller at the top to see some interesting actions I’ve posted, all available to be imported directly into your Drafts action list for you to use immediately. Feel free to check back there regularly as well, as I’m posting new actions and workflows each week. You can also [look around here on MacStories](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/tag\/url-scheme\/) for more great actions. Federico is always scattering gems around throughout his posts. If you do import any of our actions, I encourage you to check out the code in your settings in Drafts and make sure you understand how every action you’ve installed actually works. That should help further grow your knowledge of iOS automation with Drafts and URL actions, and give you more examples to run off as you start to create your own.\n\nNow go build something awesome.

    "content" : "# iSH Wiki\nThe packages in Alpine Linux repositories are more updated the iSH's own repositories and have packages whose size > 512 MB as well. To use it to replace iSH's own repositories, run:\n\n```sh\ngrep -v \"file:\/\/\/ish\/apk\/\" \/etc\/apk\/repositories | dd of=\/etc\/apk\/repositories bs=4194304\necho https:\/\/dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org\/alpine\/v3.12\/main >> \/etc\/apk\/repositories\necho https:\/\/dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org\/alpine\/v3.12\/community >> \/etc\/apk\/repositories\n```\n\nNote : The reason why iSH has it's own repositories is so that the app is entirely self-contained so that iSH with `apk` can pass app review. The repositories is a pseudo `apk` filesystem mounted on \/ish\/apk that when read, will actually download from App Store as on-demand resources. It also means that Apple can review all packages in iSH's repositories.\n\niSH 1.1 includes the [APK package manager](https:\/\/wiki.alpinelinux.org\/wiki\/Alpine_Linux_package_management). To keep the app self contained while also not including gigabytes of packages, files are downloaded from the App Store as [on-demand resources](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/archive\/documentation\/FileManagement\/Conceptual\/On_Demand_Resources_Guide).\n\nIf you updated from a previous version, you won't have the iSH-provided APK, since enabling it is a potentially destructive action (overwriting \/etc\/apk\/repositories). To enable it manually, run this command after installing the 1.1 update:\n\n```\nmkdir -p \/ish\/apk && printf 'file:\/\/\/ish\/apk\/main\\nfile:\/\/\/ish\/apk\/community\\n' > \/etc\/apk\/repositories && mount -t apk apk \/ish\/apk && tar -xf \/ish\/apk\/main\/x86\/apk-tools-static-2.10.5-r1.apk -C \/ && apk.static add apk-tools && rm \/sbin\/apk.static && apk upgrade\n```\n\nIf this fails with `mkdir: can't create directory '\/ish\/apk': Operation not permitted`, run this slightly different command:\n\n```\nprintf 'file:\/\/\/ish\/apk\/main\\nfile:\/\/\/ish\/apk\/community\\n' > \/etc\/apk\/repositories && tar -xf \/ish\/apk\/main\/x86\/apk-tools-static-2.10.5-r1.apk -C \/ && apk.static add apk-tools && rm \/sbin\/apk.static && apk upgrade\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you have no important data, you may delete and reinstall the app to use the new default filesystem.\n\nStarting from this build, the default iSH filesystem reserves the directory \/ish for its own internal bookkeeping. A “default” filesystem is identified by the existence of a directory at \/ish. The command above will create this directory. Current uses for this directory include updating the version file to match the build of iSH that it was opened with and mounting a synthetic filesystem to provide the ODRs necessary for the built-in APK. If you don't want this, run `umount \/ish\/apk && rm -rf \/ish`.\n\nIf you run into any issues (which is not unlikely as we barely tested this), please contact us.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* We forgot to include the community repository in this version. This is fixed in 1.1.1 (build 88). Workaround: `echo 'file:\/\/\/ish\/apk\/community' >> \/etc\/apk\/repositories`\n* If you already have a \/ish directory, iSH will \"take it over\" by creating \/ish\/version. We realize this may cause problems for people who have created and are using \/ish for other reasons. The next update will only reserve it for internal use if \/ish\/version exists. Workaround: `umount \/ish\/apk`, `rm \/ish\/version`, rename the directory.\n* Resizing the terminal (e.g. hiding the keyboard, rotating the screen) will cancel any ongoing package downloads. We will fix this in the next update. Workaround: don't resize the terminal.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Q: My favorite program doesn’t work!\n**A:** That’s not a question, but this is not surprising. Much of the emulation is still not finished, and many programs *will* fail. Do not hesitate to create [an issue](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt\/ish\/issues\/new) if the specific program is not already on the [to-do list](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt\/ish\/projects\/7), as it will be brought to the attention of the contributors, and they will (eventually) make it work. You can also check out [this page](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt\/ish\/wiki\/What-works%3F) on the wiki where users actively test common programs.\n\n### Q: When is the next TestFlight build coming out?\n**A:** Sooner than it took for build 32 to come out. New builds are more frequent, and the app will be updated when something new has been added or fixed.\n\n### Q: Is iSH 32-bit or 64-bit?\n**A:** The app itself is a 64-bit ARM binary so that it can run on modern versions of iOS. iSH emulates x86_32 and as such can only run software compiled for this platform (specifically, it cannot currently run 64-bit ELF executables).\n\n### Q: Why does iSH not emulate ARM or some other architecture?\n**A:** Mostly because x86 was what [@tbodt](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt) was comfortable with at the time. Using x86 also has the added benefit of letting us access to the rich set of software that’s already been built for this platform. Performance-wise the choice of architecture is not all that important, since the code is being emulated anyways (that is, using ARM wouldn’t actually help much).\n\n### Q: Why does iSH emulate at all? Can't it use a JIT compiler, or virtualization?\n**A:** iOS devices lack support for hardware virtualization, and even if such a thing did exist it would need to be exposed to applications before it could be used. Generating code on the fly, which is required for JIT compilation, is not intended for use by third-party applications and such a technique requires entitlements that cannot be used when uploading to App Store Connect (as is necessary for distribution via TestFlight).\n\n### Q: Why is iSH on TestFlight and not on the App Store? I’m scared that Apple will find this in violation of the App Store Guidelines; will it ever be on the App Store?\n**A:** ~~We really have no idea. iSH is currently in beta (hence the use of TestFlight) and Apple has continued to approve the app for this, but we have not tried to submit the app for full App Store review and cannot say what would happen if we did.~~ iSH is now [available on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/ish-shell\/id1436902243)!\n\n### Q: I lost access to the TestFlight?\n**A:** That might be because we hit the limit of testers, at 10,000, so we did some house cleaning and removed testers who have either been inactive, or haven't updated. If need be [you can join the TestFlight again.](https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/join\/97i7KM8O)\n\n### Q: Why am I getting apk not found?\n**A:** App Store restrictions, however, you can [install it](https:\/\/github.com\/ish-app\/ish\/wiki\/Installing-apk-on-the-App-Store-Version).\n\n### Q: How do you know what an instruction does?\n**A:** Generally we look [here](https:\/\/www.felixcloutier.com\/x86\/).\n\n1. Open the Files app\n2. Click Edit in the top-right corner![](iSH%20Wiki\/71757349-c711fa80-2e5a-11ea-8003-f0ebab053a71.jpeg)Arrow showing where the edit button is\n3.

For scrolling your history, use the arrow key in the custom [keyboard addition](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt\/ish\/wiki\/User-Interface#custom-keyboard).\n\nIf you hide the keyboard, you can make it re-appear by tapping anywhere on the screen.\n\n## Custom Keyboard\niSH comes with a custom keyboard addition.\nAt the top of the keyboard you'll find an extra set of keys.\nIt helps with navigating in the terminal, and contains useful modifier keys.\n\nHere's what they do:\n\nNavigating with the arrow key is simple! Press the key and slide your finger in the direction you want. The key will repeat.\n\n## Settings\n\n## Getting started with the iSH app itself\nIf you do not want to compile the project from source, you can join the [TestFlight beta program](https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/join\/97i7KM8O)! It's free and gives you an instant download of the app.\n\n## In iSH\nWhen you have iSH on your device, you can open it. You'll be greeted with the terminal. Here are some important tips:\n* iSH uses the Alpine Package Manager, `apk`. You will have to run `apk update` to fetch the Alpine repository list.\n* When Alpine is up-to-date, you can search for a program with `apk search <name>` and install it with `apk add <name>`.\n* Above the keyboard you can see the Accessory View, and it contains crucial buttons. Starting from the left, the buttons are `tab`, `control`, `escape`, `arrow keys`, `settings` and `hiding the keyboard` (which, was formerly more formally known as `black down pointed triangle`). These modified keys will help you navigate around.\n\n## Questions\nSome questions may be answered on the [FAQ page](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt\/ish\/wiki\/FAQ). If the question isn't mentioned or you want to directly ask the developers a question, feel free to [join the Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/SndDh5y) or [create an issue](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt\/ish\/issues\/new).\n\nAs said [here](https:\/\/github.com\/tbodt\/ish\/wiki\/FAQ#q-x-does-not-work) many programs do fail, so here is a list of programs known to be working (or not).\n\nIf you add a new test for a package, please add a line (same if package was already tested). Feel free to update the device tested if the build is newer.\n\n| Package name | Is working? | Notes | iSH version number |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| `grep`, `head`, `cut`, `wc` |Yes||33|\n| `tput` |Yes||33|\n| `irssi` |Yes|| 38 |\n| `ifconfig` |No| `ioctl 0x8912 failed: Invalid argument` | 33 |\n| `ip` | No | `ip: socket(AF_NETLINK,3,0): Invalid argument` | 33 |\n| `weechat` | Yes ||53|\n| `bash` | Yes || 33 |\n| `zsh` | Yes | | 48 |\n| `nano` | Yes ||33|\n| `nvim` | Yes | |41|\n| `vim` | Yes ||33|\n| `vi` | Yes ||33|\n| `fish` | Yes ||45|\n| `neofetch` | Yes ||52|\n| `screenfetch` | No | *\/proc\/cpuinfo: No such file or directory* |33|\n| `node` | Yes || 73 |\n| `curl` | Yes | HTTPS too |33|\n| `wget` | Yes | HTTPS too |33|\n| `python3` | Yes ||33|\n| `youtube-dl` | Yes | Very slow to start |35|\n| `cmus` | No | Bad system call |52|\n| `ffmpeg` | Yes | |35|\n| `emacs` | Yes |works recursively in `M-x term` !|36|\n| `openssh` (client)| Yes | |31|\n| `openssh` (server)| Yes | Follow the [instructions on the wiki](Running-an-SSH-server) |45|\n| `openssh` (server)| No | tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 `illegal instruction at 0xf79f981d: 0f de d8 66 0f de e2 66 `| 74 |\n| `resolvconf` | Yes | Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 | 74 |\n| `ps` | Yes ||34|\n| `ruby` | Yes ||34|\n| `irb` | Yes ||35|\n| `gem` | Yes ||38|\n| `go` | Yes | |67|\n| `mate-session`| No | Bad system call |37|\n| `tmux` | Yes ||53|\n| `screen` | Yes |Detaches and reattaches!|53|\n| `figlet` | Yes | |40|\n| `uptime` | Yes | |40|\n| `links` | Yes |  |40|\n| `lynx` | Yes ||40|\n| `gdb` | No | Segfault, socketcall 16 |40|\n| `w3m` | Yes| Quits with `GC Warning: Couldn't read \/proc\/stat` |40|\n|`nmap`| No | Assertion failed | 40|\n|`&`, `bg`, `fg`, `jobs`|Yes||44|\n|`mc`| Yes | F-keys don't work |48|\n|`ed`| Yes | |52|\n|`git`| Yes | |53|\n|`mosh`| Yes | |54|\n|`gcc `| Yes | |55|\n|`gawk`| Yes | |55|\n|`clang`| Yes | |55|\n|`arp`| No | can't open '\/proc\/net\/arp': No such file or directory | 73 |\n|`php`| Yes | |65|\n|`php (extensions)`| Yes | |65|\n|`stunnel3`| Yes | perl needs to be installed |65|\n|`perl`| Yes | |65|\n|`openssl`| Yes | Even signing certificates work perfectly fine |65|\n|`dillo`| Partially working | Follow the [instructions ](https:\/\/github.com\/ish-app\/ish\/wiki\/Running-a-VNC-Server) to install VNC server.

Basically: no more unofficial Twitter apps that look just like the official iOS, Mac, Android or BlackBerry apps and don’t add any value to the experience. Instead, focus on different areas of the whole Twitter experience. Uh oh.\n\nThe move is quickly causing a reaction among developers on Twitter that didn’t expect such a response from the company. Basically, although in a subtle way, they’re telling everyone to stop wasting time trying to emulate the official Twitter apps because 90% of users are already using Twitter through the officially provided tools. On top of that, though, it’s not only a matter of choice: it seems like Twitter is really going to force developers to stop building apps by “holding you to high standards to ensure you do not violate users’ privacy, that you provide consistency in the user experience, and that you rigorously adhere to all areas of our Terms of Service”. Some key parts from the announcement:\n\n> With more people joining Twitter and accessing the service in multiple ways, a consistent user experience is more crucial than ever.  As we talked about last April, this was our motivation for buying Tweetie and developing our own official iPhone app.  It is the reason why we have developed official apps for the Mac, iPad, Android and Windows Phone, and worked with RIM on their Twitter for Blackberry app. As a result, the top five ways that people access Twitter are official Twitter apps.  \n\n> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter.  More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience.  The answer is no.  \n\n> As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.  \n\nThis announcement from Twitter is very surprising in my opinion, mostly because Twitter’s expansion and success happened thanks to third party clients for the desktop, iOS and Android that brought the Twitter platform years ago where it wasn’t available. Today Twitter has its own apps, but years ago it was only the API. And now they’re kindly telling everyone to stop building new “regular” clients because there’s no reason to do so. Whether or not they’ll go after every single new client that comes out and “reproduces the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience” is unclear at this point. Will they run quality control for every single new app they find and block its API access? Or is this just an announcement to instill fear and discourage developers? We don’t know yet, but devs surely aren’t appreciating the news. And we understand them.\n\nOf course, Twitter has confirmed the existing apps can keep serving their users as long as they maintain “high standards”. But for new developers, the focus should be put into data, social publishing tools, curation. What happens when Twitter expands to those areas, though? We don’t know.\n\nAs long as the Mac and iOS are concerned, we are surrounded be great third-party apps like [Twitterrific](http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitterrific-for-twitter\/id414957465?mt=12), [Echofon](http:\/\/www.echofon.com\/), [Hibari](http:\/\/hibariapp.com\/) – and dozens of new Twitter clients come out every week, both for iPhones and iPads and Macs. Perhaps some of them aren’t great, many of them are actually terrible, but to each his own, they say. From now, at least from Twitter’s point of view, it’s all going to be about quality control, rather than choice.\n\nSurprisingly, or maybe not, this announcement comes [a few days after the implementation](http:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/twitter-updates-ios-app-with-lots-of-new-features\/) of promoted tweets (read: ads) into the official Twitter client for iPhone. [ [via](http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/twitter\/2011\/03\/11\/twitter-tells-developers-to-stop-developing-new-twitter-clients\/) ]\n\n**Update**: as many readers suggested on Twitter, here are some third-party clients you should try:\n\n## Mac\n\n* Twitterrific\n* Weet\n* Hibari\n* Seesmic\n* Kiwi\n* YoruFukurou\n* Echofon\n* TweetDeck\n* Socialite\n* Destroy Twitter\n* HelTweetica\n\n## iOS\n\n* Twitterrific\n* Osfoora\n* Friends\n* Tweetlist\n* Weet\n* Echofon\n* Twittelator\n* Tweetings\n\n[Twitter To Developers: Enough With The Twitter Clients](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/)\n\n#archive",

    "content" : "∆ **Facebook Exceeding Limits of Usability**\n\nWow. Opinion on a social media service this early in the game?\n\nYeah.\n\nI have used a lot of online services for a very long time, ok? Instead of maintaining friendships in sixth grade, I was beta testing Skype. I've been using iOS since 2008. (Imagine being regularly asked \"what is that?\" of the iPhone in your hand. A different time, I think.) This is one of many things that I repeat often to people who don't particularly care, but I do genuinely believe it is remarkable enough to warrant a more detailed exploration in another URL in the future.\n\nProbably the one service I've checked every day consistently for as long as I've been around is Twitter, which recently announced \"oh shit\" status in regards to its lack of growth and unhappy investors.\n\nI can tell you, though, that for someone like me, it is nearly faultless, which is incredibly rare. I cannot fathom the intuitive obstacles which longtime Facebook users claim to face when they give it a go, as it is (and always has been) ridiculously simple in comparison. Such extensive use on my part makes my bias, though, as its systems have likely been ingrained into my psyche more deeply than very little else, familial or otherwise.\n\nI'll make a solid claim for an extraordinary ability to quickly learn and understand UI as a result of so much software use throughout my youth. As I observed Facebook for iOS' Version 56.0 in my available updates list today, reflected upon my attempts to deliver *Extratone*'s Facebook Page, and remembered a friend's recent comment on Facebook Live's newly-attained superiority over Periscope, I felt compelled to finally address (read: complain about) this Mammoth Net Menace.\n\nWithout stats on use, lets assume that the vast majority of Facebook accounts are dormant - everybody's either dead, or using the service as a sort of address book for old friends and acquaintances. I think this is its most reasonable and unique function by far, and it obviously  warrants millions to keep an account.\n\nAssuming the majority of the millions are mostly ignorant regarding their smartphone's data\/resource usage, just imagine how much heat is being created by totally irrelevant background processes. Imagine the potential *drag* on our infrastructure Facebook could be responsible for.\n\nUnlike sane app developers, Facebook's codemonkeys are required to come up with a new release *every week*. I can't even begin to impart the scale of the consequences of such misincentive.",

    "content" : "I believe Brent and I have agreed on rent: $160, bi-weekly. It'll be interesting trying to sustain such things.\n\nAs my payment for extratone.com has gone through, I should plan to officially launch it in one week. I think this is a good opportunity to finally draft up the *history of Drywall* as best as possible. I'd like my official title to be **Scry**, I think.\n\n∆\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been stricken with a primal need to \"create\" content of infinitely many sorts. In Kindergarten, I professed my love for my first crush in a \"mixtape\" recorded on a My First Sony. I can't imagine it possessed much musical value in the objective sense, but it was probably quite *Dry*, as we say in the movement.\n\n*Elizabeth, hit me up if you've somehow retained the cassette. I would pay a hefty sum for it.*\n\nIn Elementary school, I spent a fair amount of time surrounding myself in a mass of cassettes and microcassettes sourced from garage sales and my mother's collegiate surplus. As **Brent** can attest, I often left a trail of them behind me whenever I traveled.\n\nI also wrote a 60-something page novella inspired by *The Boxcar Children* in third or fourth grade, and it was quite terrible, as you'd expect.\n\nMy first videos on YouTube were awful firearm reviews as per my irreverence for Nutnfancy. (He's still the best tactical obsessive on the web.) And my brief obsession with the exploding personal technology industry spawned a terribly-named \"tech review\" channel that I shall spend the rest of my days trying to forget.\n\nWhen I began my foray as a student pilot, I maintained a \"vlog\" for every lesson, including tremendously-tedious in-cockpit audio recordings. Though I've done my best to remove all traces of the product, the side-effectual experience I gained with audio and video came along with me to high-school, where its magnitude was - to my surprise - quite unusual.\n\nLuckily, by my Junior year, I had found a group of friends that nurtured my lacking self-awareness,  gradually propelling me into a state of all-consuming embarrassment with my portfolio as it stood. This began a sort of reactionary period to the ideals I'd held in my youth, which I've just recently determined with confidence as the origin of *Drywall* as an ideological system.\n\nI had put significant effort into everything I'd done. My tendency to obsess over revision was exploited by the capabilities of modern video editing software, particularly. Though it was always my own, there was always a standard of quality to crawl toward. All that effort, though, had gone toward work which was simply not lucrative, despite my own particular polish. Exposure - as it does - had drastically evolved my perspective, and left me with a worthless body of work spread over a plethora of identities due to my dabbling nature.\n\nIn conjunction with the daily conversations with my friends, I decided the solution was to consolidate *every* new work under one banner, which would operate entirely absent of any consideration for audience whatsoever. I knew that removing as completely as possible any filters from my \"creative process\" would exponentially increase my output volume, at least.\n\nIt was in those school lunch discussions that **Brent** and I discovered our mutual adoration of **clippng**, a classification of distortion unique to digital audio. All the while, I was learning the essential mechanics of electronic hardware under Jim Kyd's *Electronics I & II* courses. Though it wasn't a part of the curriculum, Mr. Kyd indulged those who would listen in little wisdoms he'd accrued throughout his various careers. I learned some finer points and foundational formulas in audio engineering, which I would put to use in our early productions.\n\nThe first was *The Tinnitus Ep*, for my friends' punk\/noise band, Apathetic Cake Gluttons. It was a live recording on 5 simultaneous channels from 4 separate improvised sources. The final product could be considered impressive, I suppose, considering it is most certainly my first attempt at multitrack mixing. The band's Twitter account has survived the years, astoundingly, and still proclaims \"we make music that you download.\"\n\nI think the audio track for the *What the Fuck?* video got something like 80,000 listens on Brent's SoundCloud, but by most measures, the ancient web presence lies.\n\nAfter that year, enough began happening in my day-to-day life that it's difficult to be definite about much. From what hard data remains intact, we can infer that the year (almost to the day) that passed between the death of the *Gluttons* and the first official Drywall release was spent honing my ability to consistently molest *Garageband 2008*, despite its restrictions as a wholly-pedestrian DAW. [Digital Audio Workstation]\n\nThat Christmas (2010,) I asked for a Samson C01-U condenser mic (a gift which has astoundingly survived 6 years of semi-regular use,) which allowed me to bypass the need for a digital audio interface by simply outputting directly to USB 2.0. Considering the breadth of environmental horrors we've subjected it to since (including *Miata Music 2*, the mixtape recorded, edited, \"mastered,\" produced, *and* uploaded without leaving the open cloth seats of my NB MX-5,) I can proclaim it to be - without hesitation - the highest-value piece of equipment I've ever had the fortune to own.\n\nThough I was afraid to abuse it, at first, as all the microphones I'd used were dynamic, cheap, and tolerant. But by late summer, I was willing to position it just above a treadmill to capture an integral sound to *Hamura*, the first and debatably-Dryest of my entire discography.\n\nI recorded the first track, *The Deep Wound My Parents Left Me Because You Are Gone And I Have Too Many Won't Help Come To Me Tonight*, having yet to decide whether or not to call it Drywall or Hamura, with zero intention of monitoring each successive track as they were laid down.",

It’s an incredibly useful tip for Mac users as it cuts out the awkward middle steps of having to transfer it from phone to computer, or grabbing it from the Mac’s Notes app after it syncs. Shoutout to TikTok account [@keyboardshortcuts](https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@keyboardshortcuts\/video\/6932538573182864645?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow9cMUNyMOkFIuCRcO4Th%2BsZMqOgP%2BfcLYE79iAO63xtEW2JBKIpVVkSlinLm5IENOGgA%3D&amp;language=en&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAZoPuAG0cRxyaGHfZc077n7yevrdk2cjBsqsGdaASBbmsbkXLgk8CWoaeD6XSuvJA&amp;share_item_id=6932538573182864645&amp;share_link_id=115A424D-A15C-4E18-9DFE-2C18D8613353&amp;timestamp=1614464675&amp;tt_from=more&amp;u_code=d33lm8d588e9ii&amp;user_id=6621985261382615045&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=more&amp;source=h5_m) for bringing it to my attention.\n\nBesides Notes, the iPhone’s scanner can be accessed from a number of different Mac apps, including the Finder, Mail, Messages, and Pages 7.2 and later. To use it, control-click (or right-click) in the window you want to scan the document into, select “Import from iPhone or iPad,” and then click “Scan Documents.” The camera app will magically open on the linked mobile device, where a scan can be taken as usual — no wires required. Once done, the scanned document will end up in the Mac app with a minimum of hassle. I found it useful to scan a bunch of legal documents directly into a new folder in Finder, for example.\n\nAccording to a [support page for the feature](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-gb\/HT209037), the Mac will need to be running macOS Mojave or above, and the iPhone or iPad needs to be running iOS 12 and above. Both devices need to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on, and signed into iCloud with the same Apple ID with two-factor authentication enabled. \n\nAs well as scanning documents, the feature can also be used to take photos. Simply select “Take Photo” rather than “Scan Documents” from the menu and tap the shutter button on your mobile device to capture an image.\n\nCamera Continuity isn’t a new feature, but its compatibility with the iPhone’s document scanner was news to me.\n\n[Today I learned the iPhone’s excellent document scanner can be controlled from a Mac](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/3\/1\/22306875\/apple-continuity-camera-ios-ipados-document-scanner-macos-mojave) | *The Verge*\n\n #archive #documentation",

But given the [security incident](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterSupport\/status\/1283518038445223936?s=20)we discovered on July 15, 2020, the timing of our launch no longer made sense or felt right.*\n\n*We updated this post on August 12, 2020 to include additional details below to support the official launch of the new Twitter API.*\n\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n\n- - - -\n\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n\nToday, we’re introducing the new Twitter API. Rebuilt from the ground up to deliver new features faster, today’s release includes the first set of new endpoints and features we’re launching so developers can help the world connect to the public conversation happening on Twitter.\nIf you can’t wait to check it out, [visit the new developer portal](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/portal\/opt-in). If you can, then read on for more about what we’re building, what’s new about the Twitter API v2, what’s launching first, and what’s coming next. \n\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n\nYour feedback has been essential in helping us define our vision and roadmap for the new Twitter API. From Tweets to focus groups, you have shared a ton of feedback with us over the past few years about what you need out of the Twitter API and what we can do better. We also [learned a lot](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/developer\/en_us\/topics\/tools\/2020\/a-year-with-twitter-developer-labs.html) through [Twitter Developer Labs](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/developer\/en_us\/topics\/tools\/2019\/building-the-next-generation-of-the-twitter-api.html) where you’ve been sharing real-time feedback on the new API features we’ve tested in the open. \n\nWe’ve always known that our developer ecosystem is diverse, but our API has long taken a one-size-fits-all approach. Your feedback helped us see the importance of making the new Twitter API more flexible and scalable to fit your needs. With the new API, we are building new elevated access options and new product tracks, so more developers can find options to meet their needs. More on that below.\nWe also know it’s important to be able to plan ahead, and we want to do a better job of sharing our plans with you in advance. Going forward, we’ll share more of what’s coming next on our [public roadmap](https:\/\/trello.com\/b\/myf7rKwV\/twitter-api-platform-roadmap)  (updates coming soon). We're also sharing a [Guide to the future of the Twitter API](http:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/products\/twitter-api\/early-access\/guide)  for more about what to expect as we roll out the new API. We have a lot planned, and it will evolve and improve as we continue to hear from you. \n\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n\n**A new foundation** - The new API is built on a completely new foundation —  [rebuilt for the first time since 2012](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/engineering\/en_us\/topics\/infrastructure\/2020\/rebuild_twitter_public_api_2020.html) — and includes new features so you can get more out of the public conversation. That new foundation allows us to add new functionality faster and better than we’ve done in the past, so expect more new features from Twitter to show up in the API.\n\nWith this new foundation, developers can expect to see:\n\n* A cleaner API that's easier to use, with new developer features like the ability to specify which fields get returned, or retrieve more Tweets from a conversation within the same response\n* Some of the most requested features that were missing from the API, including conversation threading, poll results in Tweets, pinned Tweets on profiles, spam filtering, and a more powerful stream filtering and search query language\n\n**New access levels** - With the new Twitter API, we’re building multiple [access levels](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/products\/twitter-api\/early-access\/guide#newways) to make it easier for developers to get started and to grow what they build. In the past, the Twitter API was separated into three different platforms and experiences: standard (free), premium (self-serve paid), and enterprise (custom paid). As a developer's needs expanded, it required tedious migration to each API. In the future, all developers — from academic researchers to makers to businesses — will have options to get elevated access and grow on the same API. \n\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n\n![](Introducing%20a%20new%20and%20improved%20Twitter%20API%20%7C%20Twitter%20Blog\/develooperblogimage1.png.img.fullhd.medium.png)\n\n**New product tracks** - We love the incredible diversity of developers who use our API. Our plan is to introduce new, distinct [product tracks](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/products\/twitter-api\/early-access\/guide#newways) to better serve different groups of developers and provide them with the right experience and support for their needs, along with a range of relevant access levels, and appropriate pricing (where applicable). To start, these product tracks will include:\n\n* **Standard**: Available first, this will be the default product track for most developers, including those just getting started, building something for fun, for a good cause, and to learn or teach. We plan to add Elevated access to this track in the future.\n* **Academic** **Research**: [Academic researchers](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/use-cases\/academic-researchers) use the Twitter API to understand what’s happening in the public conversation. In the future, qualified academic researchers will have a way to get Elevated or Custom access to relevant endpoints. We’re also providing [tools and guides](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/use-cases\/academic-researchers\/helpful-tools) to make it easier to conduct academic research with the Twitter API.\n* **Business**: Developers build businesses on the Twitter API, including our [Twitter Official Partners](https:\/\/partners.twitter.com\/en) and [enterprise data customers](https:\/\/data.twitter.com\/en\/customers\/enterprise-data). We love that their products help other people and businesses better understand and engage with the conversation on Twitter. In the future, this track will include Elevated or Custom access to relevant endpoints.\n\n**A new developer portal** - To help you get the most out of the new API, we’ve also designed and built a new developer portal. This is where you can get started with our new onboarding wizard, manage Apps, understand your API usage and limits, access our new support center, find documentation, and more to come in the future. \n\n### With the new Twitter API, we hope to enable more:\n\n* Academic research that helps the world better understand our shared perspectives on important topics such as: people’s attitudes about [COVID-19](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/case-studies\/penn), the social impact of [floods and climate change](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/2\/10\/21128744\/twitter-data-floods-noaa-climate-change), or the prevalence of [hateful speech](https:\/\/hatelab.net\/projects\/) and how to address it.\n* Tools that help make Twitter better for the people who use it, like: [BlockParty](https:\/\/www.blockpartyapp.com\/), [TweetDelete](https:\/\/tweetdelete.net\/), and [Tokimeki Unfollow](https:\/\/tokimeki-unfollow.glitch.me\/).\n* Bots that share information and make conversations more fun like the: [HAM: Drawings bot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ham_drawing), [House of Lords Hansard bot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/HansardLord), and [Emoji Mashup bot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/EmojiMashupBot).\n* Businesses like [Black Swan](https:\/\/www.blackswan.com\/), [Spiketrap](https:\/\/www.spiketrap.io\/), and [Social Market Analytics](https:\/\/www.socialmarketanalytics.com) who serve innovative use cases such as social prediction of future product trends, AI-powered consumer insights and FinTech market intelligence.\n* Twitter Official Partners such as [Brandwatch](https:\/\/partners.twitter.com\/en\/partners\/brandwatch), [Sprinklr](https:\/\/partners.twitter.com\/en\/partners\/sprinklr) and [Sprout Social](https:\/\/partners.twitter.com\/en\/partners\/sprout-social) who help brands better understand and engage with their industry and customers.\n* And much more, including new things we haven't thought of yet, but that we know you will...\n\nOne of the most common reasons developers use the Twitter API is to listen to and analyze the conversation happening on Twitter. So, soon we’ll release Early Access to an [initial set of new endpoints](https:\/\/twittercommunity.com\/t\/announcing-early-access-to-the-next-generation-of-the-twitter-api\/139612) for developers to: \n\nAll API features we’re releasing first will be available in our new – always free – Basic access level. For most developers, Basic access will provide everything you need to get started and build something awesome.\n\nEventually, the new API will fully replace the v1.1 standard, premium, and enterprise APIs. Before that can happen though, we have more to build, which is why we are referring to this phase as [Early Access](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/products\/twitter-api\/early-access\/guide#rollingout). It's a chance to get started now and get ahead.\n\nUnlike Twitter Developer Labs which hosts our experiments, everything in the first release will be fully supported and ready for you to use in production. To see the full list of API functionality and endpoints that are included in today’s release, check out our [developer forum post](https:\/\/twittercommunity.com\/t\/announcing-early-access-to-the-next-generation-of-the-twitter-api\/139612).\n\nYou can get started on the new API by creating a new Project and App today in the new developer portal. You can also connect your new Project to existing Apps, if you would like.\n\nTo get started with Early Access to the new Twitter API, [visit the new developer portal](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/portal\/opt-in). If you don’t yet have a developer account, [apply](https:\/\/developer.twitter.com\/en\/apply-for-access) to get started.\n\nThis is just the beginning. We’re [sharing our public roadmap](https:\/\/trello.com\/b\/myf7rKwV\/twitter-api-platform-roadmap) to keep you updated on our vision for the API, along with options to share feedback so that we can continue to learn from you along the way and so you can plan for what’s to come. On deck: full support to hide (and unhide) replies, and free Elevated access for academic researchers.  \n\nDevelopers like you push us and inspire us every day. Your creativity and work with our API make Twitter better for people & businesses, and make the world a better place. Thanks for your partnership on the journey ahead.\n\n[Introducing a new and improved Twitter API](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/developer\/en_us\/topics\/tools\/2020\/introducing_new_twitter_api.html) \n\n#archive #tb6",

    "content" : "So I'm going to through this stanza by stanza:\n\n1st Stanza:\n\n* What is zea? Why does it need to be juiced? Why is it jabbing?\n\n* Are flats referring to the shoes? The type of apartments? Something else?\n\n2nd Stanza:\n\n* Who is \"her\"?\n\n* Is human safety glass (it should be two words) referring to man-made safety glass or safety glass made out of humans?\n\n3rd Stanza:\n\n* I enjoyed this stanza, at least from what I understood of it.\n\nThe reason I ask so many questions is that I fear that people may have trouble understanding this poem. Clearly there is a deep meaning to this poem and I can see that you put hard work into making it, but as a reader, not knowing much of what you are referring to, or in what context, makes the meaning of the poem obscured. Again, chalk this up to me simply not understanding, but that is also why I'm asking for clarification.\n\nI will say that what I seem to get from the poem is that there is some sort of parasitic group, and even though they are clearly causing destruction, they (*we*) are forgiven. Correct me if I am not on the right track though.\n\nFirst, I want to note how much it means to me that you've taken the time to so devoutly analyze my work.\nLike, it's a big deal.\n\nI hope you know yourself how wonderful it is to be so read and critiqued.\n\n-\"Zea\" is the Genus of field corn (aka maize,) and an affectionate term for it, in some way. It should've actually been \"juiced,\" as in, comparing genetically engineered corn to steroid-using humans. It must \"jab,\" because of the hardness of the over-tilled, clay-heavy soil in mid-Missouri farmland.\n\n-the \"chapped flats\" are simply the fields, mistreated from ignorance of erosion management\/general apathy toward excellence in agriculture.\n\n-\"her\" is simply the land, the Earth. commonly feminine because of its maternal role in our existence.\n\n-the \"human safetyglass\" is the emotional vessel of a rural\/military man. the words are combined simply because that how it is said, most of the time.\n\nI spent a few weeks in July interviewing veterans for a documentary and was compelled to write this upon reflection on my own rural upbringing and the battles I witnessed in so many emotionally-distant men.\n\nIt's not all that deep, really, in its fundamental sentiment: \"look at how we destroy our home; look at how we destroy our men.\"",

I walked all the way downtown, in fact.\n\nJust stepping on her street was a huge undertaking, but I've realized that I've changed more in the past year than ever, and I think I wish I could get that message to Meagan.\n\nI ended up calling a cab to go home, which was cool. It was my first time taking a taxi, and I didn't have any cash to tip the driver with. I need to remember that I owe him a tip because I promised him I'd deliver one day.\n\nI ended up having a few dreams about Meagan that made me feel pretty awful when I woke up. After about 30 minutes of thinking in bed, though, I think I made some sort of peace with the inevitability of everything. I think maybe this is some sort of transition into the acceptance stage. Meagan is still the most important thing in the world to me, though, and I would like to talk to her again. Even if my future role is that of a distant friend, I'd like to be in her life.",

Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware *espe­cial­ly* because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.)\n\nThat said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s [lat­est iter­a­tion](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/10\/18\/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs\/) may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the [ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Tweetbot\/) I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but [jus­ti­fied, sortof](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/4\/25\/17274828\/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth) ) treat­ment of its once [aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2009\/05\/02\/twitter-iphone-apps\/#S_O.z..2mqqJ), yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it *nev­er* would’ve occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble *and* bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: [the Native Fuck, itself](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitter\/id333903271?mt=8), which has also under­gone [sig­nif­i­cant cos­met­ic surgery](https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling\/276541\/), recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the *one fuck­ing but­ton* that’s giv­en the app a usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over its mobile web-based low-rent clone.\n\n“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner and “floats” as users scroll down their time­line. That means the but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood strikes.”\n\nYeah okay, *Matt*.\n\n> We’ve got a shiny, new com­pose but­ton to unveil on Twit­ter for iOS! Eas­i­er than ever to use, the float­ing icon is promi­nent­ly dis­played and per­fect for one-hand­ed scrolling and Tweet com­pos­ing.

Imag­ine if the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States was going to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only 1000 *total* Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, **get out and** [vote on my Twit­ter poll](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1062859883211620352), you fascist!\n\nIn my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile of lin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the [ear­li­est and ugli­est](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2008\/07\/17\/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store\/) ways to use Twit­ter ever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly, Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs, Twistori, and Twit­bin. These are just a few I picked up from a [10-year-old](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/02\/19\/the-top-20-twitter-applications\/) [TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/02\/19\/the-top-20-twitter-applications\/) [report](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/02\/19\/the-top-20-twitter-applications\/) list­ing the top 21 Twit­ter appli­ca­tions by traf­fic.\n\n### ***Twibs***\n\nNow, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing some­thing absurd like *The His­to­ry of Twit­ter Clients*, but the fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! *How­ev­er,* I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: **Twit­terif­ic** and **Tweet­bot**, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was *so bonkers* that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.\n\nIf you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you’d bet­ter believe that Tweet­bot has been “ [a scream­er](https:\/\/youtu.be\/DE1YHcoPxMk) ” since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the *Pre­mi­um Poweruser* seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was *fast*, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live\/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come back around to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is *daft* when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged *plugged-in-ness*, if you will. It’s the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watch lat­er.\n\n> It’s dif­fi­cult to project fic­tion­al sce­nar­ios that are more oblique and unex­pect­ed than the cra­zi­est moments from real­i­ty. We all under­stand this. And that under­stand­ing is at the core of the human attrac­tion to live­ness. We don’t crave live sport­ing events because we need imme­di­a­cy; we crave them because they rep­re­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the entire spec­trum of pos­si­bil­i­ty is in play. -“ [Space, Time, and DVR Mechan­ics](http:\/\/grantland.com\/features\/space-time-dvr-mechanics) ” by Chuck Kloster­man  \n\nTweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to explore Twit­ter than any oth­er third par­ty client, but it can’t do the live thing. (Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion if you’re so inclined, though.) All I’m try­ing to say is, **there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­ter app** — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now *that* is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! And it did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace *some* use of its own prop­er­ties.\n\nI think Tweet­bot 3 *made* me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a “poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazy now, but I know that I depart­ed my main Twit­ter account just before the app’s release, and I didn’t come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall build­ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work­ing in full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring­ing a wire­less Apple Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on what­ev­er sur­face was in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing the screen. Strange­ly, I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added to iOS, but we’re going to [con­clude for the sake of con­ve­nience](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iphone\/comments\/9y1bjd\/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards\/) that it was first includ­ed in the imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then.\n\n> The cognoscen­ti have been on Twit­ter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service’s patron saint — in Britain at least, joined in 2008. How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Fry tweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream. Men­tions of Twit­ter, usu­al­ly involv­ing celebri­ties, could be found in news­pa­pers and on break­fast tele­vi­sion. -“ [Top 10 tech­nol­o­gy high­lights of 2009](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/6817359\/Top-10-technology-highlights-of-2009.html) ” | *The Telegraph*  \n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all acknowl­edge that **this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS**. The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has [made clear this year](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2018\/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html) that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est [Tweet­Deck](https:\/\/youtu.be\/EHDOQVAQzec), which they in fact *absorbed*. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” [accord­ing to TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/17\/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients\/). I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that [Echophon](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/echofon-for-twitter\/id286756410?mt=8), [Tweet­Cast­er](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetcaster-for-twitter\/id420792544) or [Twit­ter­rif­ic](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitterrific-tweet-your-way\/id580311103) would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly *still work*, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they *[lit­er­al­ly built it](https:\/\/furbo.org\/2011\/03\/11\/twitterrific-firsts\/)*. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­time thus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with [Talon](http:\/\/klinkerapps.com\/talon-overview\/) and [Tweet­ings](https:\/\/www.tweetings.net\/apps\/) — in a [plea for con­tin­ued access](http:\/\/apps-of-a-feather.com\/) to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around the world.\n\nBoth Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but [I’ve been wrong before](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/712292559058444288). (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is [still around some­how](https:\/\/lookbook.nu\/mom).) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit­ter app still [looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble](https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/246067\/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad\/). When Tap­bots [released Tweet­bot 3](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2013\/10\/24\/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review\/#SDbMxlCvFPqx), every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble user.\n\nThis is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing [dig­i­tal media](http:\/\/extratone.com\/freq) — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot *user* as I am an idiot *read­er*. *Read­abil­i­ty* is to *Usabil­i­ty*, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I *could* do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’m capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in *Acces­si­bil­i­ty*, but Twit­ter always appears to [detest the sub­ject](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2458\/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?amp=&amp;zd=1&amp;zi=zbzf6tkp), even while qui­et­ly putting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s *not* because it’s an expen­sive one at all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can *def­i­nite­ly* fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)\n\n> Some­where out there is a social media man­ag­er using a screen read­er whose pro­fes­sion­al­ism has been under­mined by the belief that the update is avail­able to every­one. We deserve equal access to the tools our peers take for grant­ed, and the secu­ri­ty to know that we will be able to do our jobs tomor­row regard­less of updates. -Kit Englard for *[The Out­line](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2458\/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters)*  \n\nI would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing **Lists** — a sub­ject which I’ve already [Tweet­ed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/moments\/996616971880882176) and [writ­ten](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/lists\/) about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and *wouldn’t it be such a shame* to not get your money’s worth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.\n\nTweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps [my bias towards Twit­ter lists](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/lists\/) could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a [Fol­low­ing count](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/following) of over 5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time [Tweet­Bot 4 was released](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/10\/1\/9432291\/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available) in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screens and was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.\n\nToday — [in Tweet­bot 5](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode\/) — this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of Tweet­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always. Return­ing to Ye Olde Alter­na­tive in 2018 yields both famil­iar *and* new­ly-imple­ment­ed goods: ani­ma­tion and audio noti­fi­ca­tions are car­ried over and\/or updat­ed as need­ed to main­tain a flu­id and fresh expe­ri­ence. The abil­i­ty to switch between its intel­li­gent­ly-cho­sen col­or themes with a two-fin­gered ver­ti­cal swipe, alone will be jus­ti­fi­ca­tion enough for many users like myself to hand over anoth­er $4.99 to the Tap­bots devel­op­ers who’ve man­aged against all odds to one-up Twitter’s own mobile app devel­op­ment one last time. Over any oth­er alter­na­tive app, Tweet­bot 5 retains the robust qual­i­ties nec­es­sary to achieve #1 Paid Social App sta­tus on the App Store despite its new API shack­les.\n\n[#software](http:\/\/bilge.world\/tag:software)\n\n[Tweetbot 5 for iOS Review — The Psalms](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review)\n\n#archive #i"

    "content" : "# Losing Clyp, Gaining Whyp\n![Whyp Banner](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jHawyy3c.png)\n\nThe digitization of music distribution has become one of the most important stories of our age. If you know me, you know it’s one I am particularly invested in and effected by. A huge fraction of the most important people in my life are electronic musicians who’s lives are inevitably, interminably, and desperately effected by the music industry’s continued osmosis with “Big Tech” in ways that are unacceptably undercovered in popular media. As a result, the digital giants’ power over the fundamental existence of these artists - who are more essential to our cultural health than I have been able to articulate - remains dangerously consequential to a degree  unseen, trivialized, or both by the tech bro gods holding the strings, regardless of their intent. This story is difficult to write about in an engaging way because of how innocuous-seeming and nuanced its crucial bullet points can seem, like - for instance - a relatively little-known audio streaming utility [deciding with no small amount of reluctance](https:\/\/clypblog.tumblr.com\/post\/636222649313394688\/major-changes-coming-to-clyp) to eliminate its free account tier.\n\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a\/UlYSvbv\"  ><a href=\"\/\/imgur.com\/a\/UlYSvbv\">Clyp Consequences<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"\/\/s.imgur.com\/min\/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nI have a list somewhere from my *Extratone* days of online services and projects I felt I had long taken for granted. Number one - as old readers [know all too well](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music) - is Bandcamp. Number two is [Clyp](https:\/\/clyp.it\/) - what *TechCrunch* described as “An Imgur For Sound” in the [single tech media story](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/02\/06\/clyp-wants-to-be-an-imgur-for-sound\/), ever, to mention it. Back in November, I received the first email from Clyp since verifying my account signup in Fall 2016: an official announcement - which has only 5 whole notes [on their official Tumblr blog](https:\/\/clypblog.tumblr.com\/post\/636222649313394688\/major-changes-coming-to-clyp) - explaining that free uploads were dying on December 5th of this year.\n\n> Turns out hosting millions of audio files is pretty expensive. So we ended up adding premium features like lossless WAV streaming, custom playback widgets, unlimited uploads, and much more. While this helped some, it wasn’t quite enough… This was a very tough decision, but we realized it is absolutely necessary for the long-term survival of Clyp.    \n\nLet me be clear: I didn’t set out to write this to punish or even criticize Clyp for this decision. I suspect their relatively nonchalant language about the situation doesn’t reflect the whole emotional reality of their predicament. I can’t even imagine the financial implications of maintaining a streaming service as a very small company, though - quite topically, at the moment - [something like 30+](https:\/\/web-strategist.com\/blog\/2021\/01\/30\/the-future-of-social-audio-startups-roadmap-business-models-and-a-forecast\/) small team-sourced “social audio” projects have formed [a sort of frenzy](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/clubhouse-and-the-future-of-cult-driven-social-platforms?utm_source=ti_app) surrounding the Clubhouse thing which has continued to occupy much of both [tech](http:\/\/stratechery.com\/2021\/clubhouses-inevitability\/) and [meta](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2021\/02\/buzzy-social-audio-apps-like-clubhouse-tap-into-the-age-old-appeal-of-the-human-voice\/) media’s attention through the Winter. We are fucking pigging out on bandwidth right now (lmao, 5G,) as we simultaneously only just begin to consider [the greater consequences of our gluttony](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/cultural-comment\/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music).\n\nThese stories are not my burden, but celebrating the little, unmentioned tools made of love by one and two-human teams and endlessly made obscure by the business-obsessed nature of the tech publications who once claimed to hunger for capital-i Innovation is basically my life purpose, right now. It is tempting to spend time mourning all the wonderful shit I’ve seen shared (and shared, myself) with Clyp, but that story is for another time. (I would [very much like to hear](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1367583167473983493) any thoughts you’d like to share about this.

If you're not lucky enough to have any electronic music-producing friends, let me do my best to construct an image for you: its 2 in the morning and you've been fiddling with the same track in your Digital Audio Workstation since before lunchtime, but it's just *not right* - or at least, you're pretty sure something's off, but you're also growing keenly aware of the fact that your ear is beyond absolutely fucked from listening to the same set of sounds over and over again for 14 hours and you simply cannot proceed in the production process of this particular file without a break - a deep palette cleanse, and some sleep. *However*, you've also been excited about finally being able to show some friends this combination of noises you've manifested somewhat unintentionally and kept telling them all evening that you were almost finished until they gave up and went to bed.

I still do not know which Jimmy I was watching. I have not put significant effort into the recollection, though, as there are many Jimmies. I was 15 years old and newly-emancipated from the secluded circumstances of my childhood, doing my best to understand my place in the culture. Apparently, I believed for at least a moment that it involved late night television.\n\nTwitter is significant to me because I've interacted with it in some manner nearly every day since, and I am *not* what is commonly called \"a creature of habit\" by any estimation. One could surmise that my tendency to wander is out of an acute caution regarding emotional investment. There can be no doubt though: I am emotionally invested in Twitter. The fact is especially prevalent given the recent reminder of the service's mortality. Its financial feasibility as a business is in more severe doubt than ever, and I am therefore in duress.\n\nand I have interacted with the service in some manner every day since.\n\n#legacy #legacy",

It was like 2014 2015 I think it was around the time when I was an experience life before that I broke my iPhone and my mom was like no more like here it's you have a job it's your turn to get your own phone now and I was like I have like 15 fucking dollars So I went in my carrier I think it was AT&T again back then and I was like what's the cheapest phone and they were like we have one for free I just T9 so that's the phone I had for a little while that's another topic I guess but I am already. Why am I losing my front of our Jesus how do I get there a home but oh I I was saying even during that time when the new iPhones came out I still made a point to go into the store and hold them and try them right I still watch I watch all Keynote slide I think at least I watch I've definitely watch through all of them at least once even when I did not give a shit about Apple it's still a thing that I have because it's been a part of my life since I was in him But I didn't do that for the iPhone X am I didn't actually sit down and watch any of my friends that have these phones and like watch how they use them so literally I and I did not think that I was going to be getting it all again it's not a rational decision for me to get us it's just something I had to do so I didn't get out To deal with it anytime soon so I was like OK we're going to be getting new phones oh shit how do they how did they replace the home button and swipe up and I mean what are you how is it so far they did an excellent excellent job so far it's really changed my use in there OK how many millions of times have I double click the home button to get in the multitasking you to our switch got one of the most asking about iPhone 4 I think right 10 years basically I've been doing that it's just been a part of my speedy iPhone use that impresses other people and they watch me she's my phone And I haven't been switching to have to do that whatever you have to like slowly scroll up it it really I mean obviously it's ingenious right obviously I figure this out but also for what nine years or something I have no control centers around I've been swiping up to get to the control center and I have to swipe down this is like I don't know my iPhone muscle memory is not what are used to be for one thing because I just don't I'm just not mobile so it's helped kind of learning but I think what I was saying originally is that I just don't use the multitasking you as much as I found myself searching for the app and Dragons versus fast faster but I don't I don't I miss it yeah I was gonna say it's a little awkward a hold on the side button for your theory but fry I've been exploring many as the ad seems that they made a horrible figure of all I have gone through my really I just been like holy shit there's a lot haven't comprehend at all yet I don't is it really any more awkward than holding a home button was thinking back on that I mean there is an iPhone It was so unusual and yes it was revolutionary that complaining now that now in retrospect the complaining about this alteration just seems erotic because I had to get used to that because I was 14 and now I'm 86 and getting old yeah I'm home but yeah\n#transcription",

[Twitter just acquired Revue](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/26\/22250156\/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service), which is a newsletter product similar to Substack. And it also [announced something called Super Follows](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers), which will let people pay creators on Twitter for special content.\n\nIt’s a lot, especially after Twitter spent so long seemingly not adding any features at all.\n\nOn today’s episode of *Decoder*, I talk with Kayvon Beykpour, the head of consumer product at Twitter. He’s responsible for deciding what tools Twitter actually builds for people to express themselves. Twitter’s product is incredibly important — it is a flashpoint of interest and controversy for politicians and regulators around the world, and it often seems like politicians in our own government don’t know the difference between Twitter and real life. \n\nBeykpour and I talked a lot about what it took to reset the team toward growth, how he decides what to prioritize, and what the timelines for success look like on different projects. And of course, we also talked about paying for tweets and competing with Clubhouse.\n\nOkay, Kayvon Beykpour, head of consumer product at Twitter. Here we go.\n\n**It’s been a while since we chatted. I’m excited to have you on the show.**\n\nAlmost two years. It was [October 2019 the last time](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/10\/15\/20913994\/podcast-twitter-head-of-product-kayvon-beykpour-interview-auto-delete-tweets-vergecast) [we talked]. Me, you, and Casey.\n\n**Yeah, it was me and Casey Newton. I think you had just become the head of product at Twitter. You’ve now made it almost three years. That might be the longest anyone has been the head of product at Twitter, so congratulations.**\n\nI feel like I’ve been in the role long enough that people don’t remind me every week how long it’s been since I’ve been the head of product.\n\n**There was a sign at Twitter HQ that was “days since last head of product,” but you’ve been there a long time.**\n\n**The last time we spoke, we were talking about accelerating Twitter’s product cadence, doing all this stuff. [Then] there was a pandemic. But just a couple of weeks ago, you had an analyst event, [with] lots of product announcements coming out of Twitter. Walk me through just the highlights of that, and then I really want to talk about how you decided to prioritize what to build and how you accelerated the product roadmap, because it feels like it’s going a lot faster than it was before.**\n\nSo, while we’ve definitely picked up the pace, and we announced some new stuff at our Analyst Day, and also reminded folks and showed a longer preview of what they can expect, all the stuff we announced fall into high-level categories of work that have been focus areas for us for the last couple years.\n\nI think even when we chatted, we had a few high-level areas of our product strategy that we’re focused on. One is health: how do we protect the health of the public conversation? The other is conversations: how do we incentivize people and create the tools and capabilities to inspire people to start and participate in conversations on the platform? And the other is what we call interests: how do we connect people to the people and content that they’re interested in? [That’s] fundamentally the main reason why people have been coming to Twitter for the last 15 years, but [it’s] really critical for us to build new, powerful ways for people to do that.\n\nSo health, conversations, and interests have been our big rocks for the last two and a half years. We’ve been taking bigger and bigger swings in each of those areas. At our Analyst Day event, we went in-depth on a few of them. Within “interest,” for example, last year we launched a product called Topics, which we got started — very nascent with our work there, but we’ve really accelerated. Today there’s 6,000 topics that people can follow. And it’s very simple. Rather than just following people on Twitter, you can follow a specific topic, and Twitter does the work of recommending the best content or tweets about that topic. So you don’t have to know exactly who to search for.\n\nAgain, we didn’t release that at our Analyst Day event, we just gave an update on it and shared some of the substantial progress. In Q3 of this last year, we announced that there are 70 million people that have followed topics. And then just yesterday, we announced that there now are over 100 million people that have followed topics. So a pretty good clip of growth. And we’re seeing really promising signs that Topics is a really useful way for people to connect to their interests.\n\nA couple other things we announced at our Analyst Day events: one was a product that we’re really excited about right now called Spaces, which again is very connected to our work in conversations. Spaces is a new way for people to talk about what’s happening on Twitter, except instead of using 140 characters or 280 characters or a video, you’re using your human voice to connect with other people and have real, audio-based conversations. So: a new effort, but connected to a longstanding priority.\n\nSome newer things that we announced that people hadn’t heard from us include Super Follows. So I’m assuming you might want to talk about this, but this is one that we hadn’t really talked to the world about, or been particularly transparent about, until our Analyst Day event. And we’re excited about that one because it’s really starting to stitch together a bunch of the other capabilities we’re working on.\n\nI won’t go into too much depth until you ask me about it, but that’s probably one of the newest things that we announced for the first time at Analyst Day. And then the rest of it was really just telling a cohesive story to the world around — what is our strategy? *Why* is that our strategy, and what are some of the product investments we’re working on that ladder into each of them?\n\n**I absolutely am going to ask you about Super Follows, but let me try to recast the three areas of focus that you’re describing.**\n\n**So you have ::health, which to me, is basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.:: And you’ve got to build tools and strategies there. You have conversations, which is: you need to make a bunch of tools to let people create, [to] actually make content for the platform, as opposed to just consuming it. And then you have interests, which is: find the stuff that other people made that you might like.**\n\n**Every social platform has that set of problems. I want to take them in turn. A lot of the features you have described that are most interesting to me are [related to] how do you incentivize people to create media. To me, the great story of the internet is that we put a camera and microphone in everybody’s hand, [and] everybody has become a filmmaker. Everybody has become a storyteller. Twitter is one of the best distribution networks for that kind of work.**\n\n**But I’m looking at something like Spaces, for example. We’ll just start there. It’s an interaction framework that looks a lot like Clubhouse. People are making that comparison very directly. Fleets is now at the top of my timeline. There is the wave of Stories products that hit Snapchat [and] Instagram. Fleets looks a lot like Stories. How are you deciding which of those interaction paradigms are fundamentals that you want to bring to Twitter as a fundamental? And which ones are, “oh man, that’s a great feature. We’ve got to get there first, or fast follow to make sure that a different rival social graph doesn’t form that takes our audience away.”**\n\nIt’s a good question. And contrary to [what] popular belief might be, we try to never approach it from the standpoint of “here’s a capability, let’s copy it.” We try and approach everything from first principles and, really, customer understanding.\n\nOne of the things that [Twitter CEO] Jack [Dorsey] really emphasized when he came back to the company, was morphing our product development process to respect the [“jobs to be done” framework](https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/09\/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done) a lot more. I don’t know how much you’ve heard about “jobs to be done,” but fundamentally, it just comes down to imbuing customer understanding into the product development process. And so for us, all of the work we do starts from the standpoint of: what are our customers trying to hire us for? What are they firing us for? And how do we build product solutions that have those dimensions in mind?\n\nTake something like Fleets, for example. We didn’t start it from the standpoint of, let’s copy Stories. We started it from the standpoint of “why are people not tweeting?” It turns out that some of the reasons they’re not tweeting is they don’t feel safe. They don’t feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they’re such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we’ve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you’re just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that. And so we go through and enumerate all the reasons why someone might be hiring us or why someone might be firing us.\n\n> “A lot of people are terrified to tweet.”  \n\nIn the case of tweets, this is a very common observation we have. A lot of people are terrified to tweet. A lot of people don’t use Twitter for the creation side at all. They’re here to consume. Unlocking that, finding, peeling the onion back and understanding the reasons is how we start, period. And Fleets felt like one — of many — but one product solution that can address some slice of that problem statement. It’s ephemeral, and it takes away the public replies. It takes away all the engagements. And to your point, there happens to be a format for that, that customers are familiar with. So we won’t be afraid of leveraging prior art in that sense, but we would be flying blind if we just started willy-nilly copying stuff. That’s not how we’re approaching it.\n\nWith Spaces, it’s interesting because... fundamentally, I think people for the last 15 years have been using Twitter to talk, and to talk about their interests. It’s just so basic, but in a way, I think the rise of this audio renaissance that’s happening right now is interesting because it’s taking technology that has fundamentally existed for quite some time and putting a user experience around it and a fidelity around it that allows people to engage in that same job of just having serendipitous conversations with people, but doing it in a way that is synchronous rather than asynchronous, and powered by the human voice rather than text.\n\nAnd this is particularly a special and passionate area for me because it’s not too different from how [we were approaching Periscope](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/3\/9\/8177519\/twitter-reportedly-acquires-periscope). The interesting thing is that when we started Periscope, our goal was to build the closest thing to teleportation, like, [to] see through someone else’s eyes. What we found is that 99 percent of the usage was not someone broadcasting what’s happening on the streets of Istanbul during a protest. It’s people hanging out and talking.\n\nAnd so, really taking that to heart and building an experience within Twitter that can be a layer of fabric that lets people talk with their voice; that’s how we’re approaching it. There’s some mechanics that we’ve been inspired from other startups that are doing this, and then there’s some things that we’re making our own. That, fundamentally, the way we build Spaces in our product that will allow it to shine. It’s going to look and feel very different than how some other platform will be able to tackle it. So therein lies the challenge and the opportunity for building a great product.\n\n**One of the things that has really struck me is this is a lot of new products, a lot of new challenges. What were the top three things that you had to do in your role as head of consumer product, to get to this velocity of product development and feature announcement?**\n\nThis won’t be in any particular order, but when I joined the company, one of the first things that I felt was a reticence and an uneasiness around taking big bets. And I think there’s a lot of reasons for that. It’s hard to pinpoint one. Certainly, churn in leadership is one. After a revolving door of heads of product, people stop taking any product strategy particularly seriously, because it’s like, okay, well, let’s wait until that strategy changes. And so I think there was a little bit... while no one would say that explicitly, there was this reticence to commit to long-term speculative bets, because it was rare for them to be able to be seen through.\n\nSo that’s one that I think was somewhat ingrained in the culture. Which is difficult. It’s difficult for PMs, engineers, designers who really want to push and evolve the product to come up against an organizational resistance that is not tuned to take big, speculative bets.\n\nAnd really, unwinding that, I think, has been the biggest unlock that we’ve had as a company. Today, when we contemplate solving more ambitious customer problems and in turn, postulating more ambitious product solutions, we don’t get the “no, but” as much. Every once in a while, there’s pessimism around, “oh, can we pull that off?” But we get way more of a “yes, and” vibe, and a willingness, and a patience for terrifying, ambitious bets. Whereas three years ago, any idea you would come up with, there was just a lot of pessimism around — that’s going to take a long time to build. Which is true, we’ve got a lot of infrastructure debt to work through. And also like: that’ll never ship, that would never get approved, our customers will freak out.\n\n> “We get the gift of feedback on a minute-by-minute basis. And that includes getting shit from our customers when we get it wrong.”  \n\nWhich by the way, related to your question, one of the interesting things about Twitter, which is both a great thing and can be a challenging thing sometimes, is that people use our product to love and hate on our product. And I think it’s one of the most amazing things about Twitter. We get the gift of feedback on a minute-by-minute basis. And that includes getting shit from our customers when we get it wrong. And that can make it very intimidating and scary for teams to build stuff. Because God forbid, “rest in peace, Twitter” trends. And we’ve had a lot of launches end with trending. Which I think, a few years ago, was something that would stop us from taking swings in the first place.\n\nIn my opinion, if we’re not seeing trend a few times a year, we’re not taking big enough swings. And so just as a team, shifting our mindset to get comfortable with that and lean into it and embrace it, has been a really important challenge for us to overcome. We’re not completely over the fence yet — it’s amazing that customers are starting to notice that we’re taking bigger swings, but I wouldn’t say we’re completely out of the woods yet. It’s an ongoing journey that we’re really, really focused on.\n\n> “In my opinion, if we’re not seeing RestInPeaceTwitter trend a few times a year, we’re not taking big enough swings.”  \n\nAside from that, hiring. Any leader’s job is to hire a great team. And we’ve really reshaped our leadership bench, across not just product, but design and research and engineering. We have new leaders who are filled with the energy and passion of making Twitter live up to its potential. And we think that the potential is so much higher than what the product is today. The product is obviously extremely important and plays a critical role in the world, but there’s still so much potential. I think it takes a collective team to have that irrational passion, to go through a lot of the slog that sometimes you have to go through to get there.\n\n**One of the things I always think about is leadership timelines. I’ll give a really silly example. If you’re a news writer at** ***The Verge*** **, your decision-making timeline is 30 minutes. Some news happens, you write it, you put a headline on it, you get it out in the world, you move on to the next thing. You’re operating in those increments. As I’ve moved up in my career, my decision-making timeline has extended into a year, two years, in some cases.**\n\n**You’re describing a two-year-plus process to reboot a product culture. Is that the right timeline? Is that what we should always expect? Is that the timeline you were expecting, or did you have to make some changes along the way to get to where you are now?**\n\nI can’t say I had much precision in terms of how much time I would expect it would take. There’s a lot that I thought I knew about the job going into the job, because I’d been at Twitter for three years and change prior to having this role, which gave me a lot of context in terms of our strengths, our weaknesses, our opportunities. I still feel like I’m learning on the job. I generally am an impatient person. I think it’s one of my best and worst qualities. So I try to be constantly dissatisfied about everything about our work and pace, while at the same time being able to appreciate progress that we’ve made. I’m really proud of how much we’ve morphed the culture, but I still think we have a lot to do.\n\nI think in a lot of these areas, when you talk about speed, our ability to identify a problem we want to solve, and actually ship a product solution — which I think is, ultimately, the right end-to-end timestamp to look at — there’s a lot more than just culture and process and people. It’s also infrastructure and technology. At our scale, we need to have really robust systems and a modern technology stack that allows us to build on. And this is an area where I think we’re still really investing in. We’re not out of the woods.\n\nI don’t know how much of the Analyst Day you watched, but this is one of our top company objectives, investing in our own development velocity, making a huge, multibillion-dollar commitment in leveraging public cloud solutions through AWS [Amazon Web Services] and GCP [Google Cloud Platform]. This is its own multi-year journey that I think, fundamentally, will help us unlock even more velocity when you combine it with the cultural changes, and having the clarity of strategy of knowing what we actually want to build. So it’s going to take a village.\n\nSo, I think my expectation of [the] time horizon is constantly modulating. In areas of culture and people, we need to move as quickly as possible, and in areas of execution where we have clarity in our strategy, we’re trying to think in weeks, not months or quarters. And then in other areas of a sort of broad scale re-architecture, for lack of a better word, we do have to think in years. It’s like, we’re thinking about juggling on-premise data centers with public cloud migrations, and these things require quarters, if not years, worth of long-term thinking.\n\n**So this leads me into the question that I ask almost every executive who comes on the show. What is your decision-making framework, and how has it evolved as you’ve had this role?**\n\nI think probably the biggest point of evolution for me has been knowing when *not* to be involved in a decision. It’s something that I’ve personally had to grow quite a bit on, just because I’ve run a lot of teams, I’ve started two companies, and those companies have grown to be somewhat sizable, but never at the scale that I’m operating now. And so it’s always like any leader is challenged, to figure out when to be in the weeds and when to hire great people and defer decision-making to them. \n\nSo that’s probably the biggest umbrella of personal growth and development for me, as the team has gotten larger and as my scope has gotten larger. I think ultimately the highest-leverage thing I can do besides hiring is prioritization. Helping, both me making decisions and also making sure our team is making decisions around what to focus on and what not to focus on. Deciding what we think is a high-ROI bet versus what we think is a low-ROI bet is ultimately the most impactful thing we can do, because it’s the thing we have the most control over. And so that’s still, today, the most important thing I can do and the most important form of impact I can have besides just hiring.\n\n**I’m sure people listening know, ROI is return on investment. I’m assuming by investment in that framework you mean, we’re going to spend time building something. What do you mean by return? Is it, active users are going up? Is it, revenue is going up? What is the other half of that equation for you?**\n\nThat’s a good question. And the reason why this is particularly important for us is — as you or any other user of Twitter can attest — there are far more ideas for how we can build and improve the product than we have time or people or resources to actually work on at any given point in time. Which is a good problem to have.\n\n> “Ultimately the measure of success we look at, to understand whether we’re helping or hurting the service, is growing daily active usage.”  \n\nWe have a service that almost 200 million people use every day. There’s a lot of things we can do to improve it. And so we have to be super selective with what we focus on. Ultimately the measure of success we look at, to understand whether we’re helping or hurting the service, is growing daily active usage. That’s a very lagging indicator. So internally we look at, are we solving customer problems? And we have specific metrics that tell us whether we’re helping or hurting customer problems in specific dimensions.\n\nSo in the health apparatus, that means we have any number of metrics, whether it’s the number of impressions on tweets that are deemed unhealthy or toxic, or whether it’s the amount of abuse reports that we’re seeing on a daily basis. In other areas of the product, it could mean engagement, or tweets created, or Spaces created, or — it sort of just depends on the problem area.\n\nBut when we think about ROI, the investment part is easy. The return part is basically, how much impact are we having against the metrics that matter most? And how do we — and this is the hard part — how do we compare unlike metrics together? Because having yay impact on some problem space in health, which is measured in the absence of malicious activity, is different than measuring yay impact on some feature that results in more daily active users.\n\nSo that is actually one of the harder things. And we have a bunch of different approaches that we use, whether it’s having a portfolio balance or whether it’s literally stack ranking and prioritizing on an objective basis rather than on a metric basis. There’s a bunch of different things we’ve tried. It’s an evolving art form, I would say. But ultimately that’s the hard part of the job: figuring out what are the right priorities, and how do we prioritize against them?\n\n**Two more management questions then I’m definitely going to ask a million questions about the features you announced.**\n\n**Casey actually brought this up to me when I asked him if he had questions for you: It seems like your pace of development has actually sped up during the pandemic, which is not true for most companies that went fully remote. Twitter is fully remote. That seems remarkable. Is that perception accurate? And if so, how did you manage that?**\n\nI do think our pace of development has sped up. I’m trying to think about how the pandemic specifically could have impacted that. I think of it more — and this is obviously just through the lens of Twitter, not comparing it to other companies who’ve probably had their own formula here — but we have been on a multi-year journey to speed up our development. And so I would like to think that... we’ve had our own hiccups, obviously, but we’re reaping the rewards of that investment over the last few years in our process, our culture, our hiring, our infrastructure work. And so the pandemic, I would probably say it slowed us down, it slowed that journey down for a little bit, as everyone was adjusting to the new normal. I wouldn’t say that it was a net accelerant by any means.\n\nPeople, our team included, but people even outside of Twitter, have a lot on their minds, and it’s really stressful when you’re trying to do your job with your kids at home without child care. It’s been a taxing time for everyone, so I don’t think it was a net accelerant. What we’ve done through the pandemic, beyond just continuing to accelerate, obviously, is we did make some focusing decisions around, “Hey, these two projects that were kind of in our periphery and articulated as part of our long-term strategy” [shifted to] “this is the forefront now and all this other shit’s going to pause.” We made a bunch of those decisions that I think helped narrow the aperture, which accelerated some projects and paused or slowed down other projects.\n\nAnd frankly, energy and momentum is infectious, right? As you see the company and other teams build quickly and you see customers noticing that, it inspires and motivates everyone else to want to live up to that. And so we’ve seen a bunch of that, I think, and we’re seeing it right now with Spaces.\n\nSpaces, we love that our customers love it, but there’s a real kind of energy and movement internally at the company. I’ve been at Twitter for six years now, and I’ve never seen the level of energy and embrace around any singular project at Twitter, ever, in my time, at the risk of hyperbole. We’ve had a few of those moments with these big projects — Topics being another one in the last year — that have, I think, helped the team get through the intensity of what’s going on in the world, especially when we see that the product continues to be used and be really instrumental at a time where the world needs to communicate and learn from others about what’s happening.\n\n**This is my last management question, then I really do want to start talking about Spaces and Super Follows.**\n\n**Twitter’s important to the world. We just came through, obviously, this very contentious election. We came through an insurrection at the Capitol. I saw today House Republicans are** [demanding a record of every content moderation](https:\/\/www.foxbusiness.com\/politics\/jordan-buck-demand-answers-from-twitter-on-systemic-viewpoint-based-discrimination-against-conservatives) **Twitter has ever made because they say you’re censoring Americans.**\n\n**That level of focus in the culture, how do you manage against that? Because Twitter is very important to a very small, but very powerful, group of people. A very influential group of people. And it seems like as you create new ways to create, you bring more people onto the platform, you show them more things, that level of influence just goes up in a way that — it’s possible that regulators around the world are basically going to make you stop doing things you want to do.**\n\nI think this aspect of Twitter, again, we were sort of talking about earlier, but this aspect of Twitter is one of the most unique things about it. You sort of — working at Twitter, you ride the roller coaster of whatever is happening in the world. And you feel all the highs, you feel all the lows and there’s an intensity to that that is really difficult sometimes, but it’s also really powerful and inspiring.\n\n**Did your team stop working every time Trump tweeted? I just imagined that grinding you to a halt all the time.**\n\nNo. I think we’ve gotten pretty good at being resilient enough that a single tweet doesn’t cause people to stop working. We have a lot of people on our policy enforcement team that are really good at their jobs and I have a lot of respect and admiration for the level of stress that they hold in their jobs. But I think largely... the engine of Twitter does not grind to a halt when a single person tweets, but it can make it emotionally stressful to be on the job.\n\nI’d be lying if I said that that wasn’t true. But again, you feel all the highs and you feel all the lows. You take it, when something really tragic happens in the world, or if someone does something really nefarious on the platform, it’s hard to not take that personally as something you’re responsible for. And I would like to think that that helps motivate us to do our best to build the product.\n\nBut it can also really suck sometimes. Politics and regulation is one very small slice of that, honestly. It’s not just that. But it certainly plays into it.\n\n**Let’s talk about all these new features. One thing I would link in common to everything you’ve announced — [you] bought Revue, which is a newsletter platform. You are doing Super Follows, which will let people pay for tweets from a certain — do you call them creators? Do you call them “tweeters?” What’s your preferred nomenclature?**\n\nI usually refer to them as creators. Obviously that term is so broad, because creators can be journalists, creators could be musicians, creators could be professional publishers. We’re still looking for a name that perhaps is more all-encompassing, but creators works. And by the way, it’s not just tweets. Super Follows will let your biggest fans subscribe to you and get access to exclusive content, which could be tweets, could be DMs. It could be subscriber-only Spaces. It could be subscriber-only newsletters. It could be subscriber-only Fleets. Like, think of it as stitching together all of the current and new and upcoming forms of content that someone can create on the platform, and really having this new subscriber layer and a new community, essentially, they can create that content for.\n\n**“Subscriber-only Fleets” is a real phrase and I’m going to hold that close to my heart.**\n\n**You’re building all these tools that basically let the most popular people on Twitter, or people with a passionate following, monetize that graph in different ways. Either you’re going to kick over to Revue and you’re going to charge people for a newsletter on Revue, which looks a lot like Substack. You’re going to do subscriber-only Fleets and people are just going to pay you directly. There’s a million other ways to monetize.**\n\n**That has been kind of the missing piece of the puzzle for most of the dominant platforms. I think YouTube was the gold standard for creator platforms for the longest time, because it had a built-out revenue model. And that was still mostly just AdSense and a slice of ad revenue.**\n\n**You want a lot of people to use Twitter, you want them to find their interests, and now all these little corners of Twitter are going to be behind various kinds of paywalls. How are you thinking about that holistically? If the best people on Twitter, or the most interesting people on Twitter, have this incentive to keep people from seeing their stuff, that affects the value of the service as a whole. So how are you thinking about that balance?**\n\nI don’t think the incentive is exclusively to keep all content behind a paywall. I actually think that there will continue to be an incentive for creators to sort of juggle — which, everyone’s juggle and formula is going to be a little bit different — but juggle what content they create and make available for all, and what content they create just for those subscribers. At the end of the day, you have a tremendous amount of incentive to create some form of content for all to see, because that’s how you build an audience. And then some percentage of your super fans will totally be willing to pay for content that is exclusive. You already see this mechanic with newsletters. Some newsletters are free, some issues or posts are behind the paywall. And I think a similar mechanic will exist.\n\nAnd, by the way, a lot of super fans, they just want to support their favorite creators. You see this with Patreon. I think Patreon is one of the most interesting companies in this space, frankly. And it’s not always about exclusivity. It’s about recognition and patronage, and just being able to support the creators who you appreciate the most and want to make sure they can sustain their craft. And so I think every creator will have their own twist on this, and will have their own sort of ratio of how they want to mix their content.\n\nMaybe some creators will continue creating all their content publicly, but they just want to be able to have private DM conversations with their subscribers. Or once they go create their newsletter, or drop their video, or release their merch or whatever publicly for all, they go have an audio conversation where only their subscribers can really talk about it. So I think there’s so many permutations that we imagine, that I don’t think it’s about taking the content that exists and putting it behind the paywall. I think that this new layer will incentivize a new layer of content to exist that doesn’t actually exist today.\n\n**One of the hard problems here is Twitter is an app on a phone. I use desktop Twitter, but I’m guessing the vast majority of people that are interacting with Twitter are doing it with an app on iOS or Android. If you want to enable a payment inside of an app on those platforms, you have to give a cut to Apple or Google. I’m assuming Twitter is going to want a small slice of whatever payment, because they’re enabling the interaction. You’ve probably got a payment processor in the mix. That’s a lot of cuts.**\n\n**Are you going to talk to Apple and Google about reducing the 30 percent cut for Super Follows? Because that’s a lot for a creator to bear.**\n\nYeah. I mean, we haven’t announced or decided any of the specific numbers in terms of what the cuts are. But one important piece of context — and then we can jam on this specific question, I’m not dodging it — but the important piece of context here is, we are not... for Super Follows, our goal is not for Twitter to make money. Our goal is for creators to make money. I think Twitter may incidentally participate in the transaction in some way to sort of cover our cost, but our goal isn’t to maximize revenue.\n\nThis work, just going back into the management organizational stuff, ladders up into our conversations work. And the goal of the conversations work is to incentivize conversations, to incentivize people to create conversations. So it’s just an important, subtle — but very meaningful for us — aspect of our positioning that we’d love to put as much money into the creator’s pocket as possible.\n\n> “For Super Follows, our goal is not for Twitter to make money. Our goal is for creators to make money.”  \n\nThere are transaction costs, be it the platforms or otherwise, that will need to be involved in that transaction. This is distinct, by the way, from other things we might do in the future, like a Twitter subscription. You’ve heard us talk about this. And the goal of that is very different. It’s not about empowering creators, necessarily. It’s about providing premium features for power users that let them do things that they can’t do with Twitter today. And so that’s a subtly different goal.\n\nBut on the creator side, I think the platforms and the app stores, be it Apple or Google, they have these tried and true workflows and frameworks for developers to leverage when it comes to facilitating digital goods and in-app payments, and that comes with a cost, but it also comes with a lot of benefits that increase conversion and improve simplicity and decrease fraud. And so there are definitely pros and cons there.\n\nBut we’re not tying this to one platform. Ultimately this will work on iOS, Android, web. And so we have to have a sort of a framework and a workflow that allows all of that to work cohesively well together.\n\n**Let me push on it a little bit. I’m a prolific tweeter. I say, “Okay, I’ve got 100,000 Twitter followers. I’m going to charge 10 bucks a month. I convert X percentage of them to Super Followers. Now I’m making real money. I’m making a couple thousand dollars a month.” Except I’ve got to give some amount back to Twitter, even if you’re not trying to make a profit, I’ve got to give some of that back to Twitter, because that’s how they’re covering their cost. There’s a payment processor in this mix somewhere that’s going to take — or maybe you’re going to be the payment processor. I’m told Jack Dorsey owns** [a payments company](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/3\/4\/22313108\/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z) **.**\n\nWhat? [ *Laughs* ]\n\n**So there’s a good synergy there. Then 30 percent of that $10, I’m giving away $3 to Apple and they’ve given me nothing as a creator. I get no value out of that. Maybe Twitter gets some value out of that, but me as a creator, I’m just giving away $3 of my $10 to a giant platform company. Are you in a position to advocate for a lesser amount there?**\n\nThe way I would think of this in the context of Super Follows where we’re building this layer that didn’t exist before — even if that $10 comes down to $7 because of a 30 percent fee, that’s still $7 more than you’ve been able to make on Twitter than before.\n\nSo don’t get me wrong, I would love for that to be $9 instead of $7, but at the end of the day, that’s not something that we have direct influence over on one platform. So it’s not a focus for us right now. Our focus is to build the best possible experience that is good enough that people aren’t going to think about the cut. They’re using this to have conversations and establish community and get recognition from their favorite creators. I think if we do that right, then good things will happen.\n\n**Do you think there’s a way to build this feature that gets around that rule?**\n\nWe’re not in the business of getting around platform rules.\n\n**You guys make a lot of platform rules. I imagine you have a good incentive to —**\n\nListen, I get that there’s a lot of controversy around this, and some of it is for good reason. I think that there’s a lot of positive things about these. This isn’t just a highway tax. There’s a lot of cost and effort involved in building these ecosystems that allow you to accept payments, and there’s a lot of fraud or risk involved in the whole customer service flow around refunds. A lot of that is taken off of your plate.\n\nNow, if you’re a bigger company that has a lot of those processes, then you don’t want to pay someone else for that stuff. But we don’t want to innovate around the payment flow. We want to innovate around letting creators make money from their audience. So that’s why this isn’t a big thing for us. We’d rather minimize as much effort as we can around the table stakes of facilitating payments, so that we can spend our energy on innovating for creators and for super fans of the creators.\n\n**Let’s talk about Spaces for a second. How long ago did you conceptualize Spaces?**\n\nWell, I would like to say that the beginning of when we knew audio was special was, we had this feature in Periscope, which we called Hydra — internally, I don’t think we actually ever even called it that externally — but basically when you’re live, you can pull in guests and have a zero-latency live conversation with them while everyone else watches. Casey has used this many times. I’ve been a guest in his Hydra broadcasts and fundamentally, the infrastructure that powers that is literally what Spaces is, just with a new skin.\n\nI’m sort of kicking myself now because when we released that feature two and a half years ago, we were like, “Wow, this is way more interesting than any other Periscope broadcast,” because it starts to become this multiplayer experience where the broadcaster is having this interesting conversation with someone, whether it’s a friend or someone who dropped in as part of the community or whatever, and we all get to watch. Rather than being this one-way broadcast, now it’s a conversation that you’re listening to, kind of like a podcast.\n\nAt the time, we were going through stuff and live video was not a focus. So we ended up deprecating or putting a sunset plan together for Periscope, but we knew there was something interesting there. We just didn’t move on it.\n\nFast forward to about a year ago, we really started investing in audio and thinking about how we can enable audio as a new form factor for conversation on Twitter. The same team that’s driving Spaces today really started focusing on that. The first product that they built was what we call voice tweets, which we put in market late last year on iOS. It lets you record your voice and tweet it out basically.\n\nAround the same time, they were thinking about the sort of conversational experience, and this is when audio really started heating up and Clubhouse was getting a lot of traction. So we had a long and winding road to refocus back on the sort of multi-person conversational format for audio. But the team that’s building Spaces now has had their heart in this for quite some time. Obviously, hindsight is 20-20. We found much more customer success and impact and excitement around the multi-party experience than we did with the voice tweets experience. We still see lots of really awesome use cases there, but we’ve shifted all of our focus to Spaces now.\n\n**One of the things that strikes me about social apps right at this second is, on the one hand, TikTok is an explosive success and the tool it presents to the user is an extraordinarily powerful video editor. The best TikToks I see are really well-crafted videos that use a lot of elements and bring them together that is just a very — in its way — a very high-production kind of storytelling. All the way on the other end of the spectrum, there are Spaces and Clubhouses where I just show up, I’ve had one too many, and someone is going to let me talk to a thousand people. Where on the spectrum do you think Twitter needs to be?**\n\nI think that this medium is much more close to the latter side of the spectrum than it is the former.\n\nIt’s quite intentionally not a highly-produced sort of editing environment. Anything live, I believe, is going to immediately put you on that side of the spectrum. That has pros and cons. But one thing that’s worth noting is while a lot of these audio conversations, a lot of the audio conversations that drive headlines and people talk about, tend to be these really large ones where you have few speakers and many listeners. That will happen when we GA [release for general availability] this product. If Bill Gates and Elon Musk have a conversation in a Space, there’s going to be a lot of people listening and very few people speaking.\n\nBut 99 percent of these Spaces, and we’ve already seen this in our beta, are not that archetype. That’s an important archetype and an interesting one. Most are 10-person rooms, less; people just hanging out and talking about their interests, whatever it might be.\n\nThe way you build a product experience for that use case is very different than the way you build a product experience for the massive space where there’s an interview happening or a panel discussion with a ton of listeners. We think both will happen on Twitter, and particularly for Twitter, we know all of the influencers across sports, entertainment, news, politics — they’re all on Twitter. So we want those Spaces to happen, but we know that to build the best, most durable product experience here, real people need to be able to have fun and have great, healthy discourse that happens through a medium like this with very different dynamics. You have a small room with a single-digit number of people or dozens of people at most.\n\nSo that’s what I’m really excited about. And frankly, that’s something that we kind of fucked up with Periscope. We had the same dynamic where both of those archetypes existed, but we didn’t make any one of them particularly great. The experience kind of broke down when there was a broadcast with 300,000 viewers. It just felt like chaos. And the experience felt a little bit lonely if you had 10 people, or if you had 30 followers. What are the odds you can get one of your 30 followers? So getting that right is really top of mind for us.\n\n**One of the challenges with Spaces, with all these social audio products, is moderation. So when you open Spaces right now, it tells you, “someone reports this, we’re going to record it.” But then that also is— there’s no long-tail audience there. [If] Bill Gates and Elon Musk had a conversation on Twitter right now, you can see it happening. Then maybe if you missed it, you can [still] go see it on Twitter. Maybe BuzzFeed will aggregate it. Someone will do something with it. There’s a long tail of people getting to consume that. Spaces right now, doesn’t have recording, it doesn’t have an archive, but you also need that stuff in order to moderate it well. Where’s the push and pull of that stuff?**\n\nI think there’s a couple of layers of this. One, just as a baseline, we have our policy and enforcement apparatus that needs to be well-integrated here, and sort of up to snuff for the medium. So that’s where we do record right now, for purposes of health enforcement. There’s a bunch of tools and automation we can build to make that as efficient and sophisticated as possible, given that there are going to be many Spaces live at any given point in time. That’s very difficult. You can’t solve this problem alone with it, but it is important nevertheless, and the good news is we’re not starting from scratch here. We’ve built much of this for the last six years with live video. There are some nuances that are different about not having a video stream to accompany your enforcement techniques, but there’s a lot of shared attributes in moderation here.\n\nThe second layer, and I believe the most important one, is actually building native product features and native functionality imbued into the product that helps all of the actors within this conversation: the hosts, the speakers, the delegated admins that the host might have, and the listeners, be able to take part in optimizing for health. This sort of decentralization, I think is really, really important, not as the sole measure of health enforcement, but ultimately, a lot of what’s going to keep these conversations safe is making sure the right people have the right control.\n\nThe host should be able to decide who’s in, who’s out. The host should be able to empower some of their speakers or their listeners to be able to aid in the moderation process, because if you’re hosting a conversation with 20 people, let alone if you have 3,000 people in a Space, you’re already juggling a lot of shit. You need some backup, and this is product functionality that can help the conversation feel not overwhelming, help the conversation feel, ultimately, safe from unwanted interactions, and can feed into the sort of health enforcement apparatus as well.\n\n> “We would be kidding ourselves if we thought we could be the police officers for all live audio conversations happening globally at any given point in time.”  \n\nSo that dimension is the one where I think there’s a lot of innovation to be had. That’s the one where we’re trying to lead from the forefront. In the next three weeks, a lot of the features that we’re going to be adding fall into this category, and it’s sort of in the spirit of scaling moderation. And again, as a base layer, we obviously need to do everything we can to have clear policies, the right policies, [and] enforce against those policies, but we also would be kidding ourselves if we thought we could be the police officers for all live audio conversations happening globally at any given point in time. We need to be smarter than just that. So we’re approaching it as holistically as we can.\n\n**This was a great Periscope feature where — you’d be watching a Periscope, you would see the comment stream float by, and then you, as a user, a comment would get flagged to you and it would ask you if this comment needs to be moderated in some way. That makes sense when it’s text. How would you build something like that for audio? Are you just going to ask people, is this speaker being rude?**\n\nSo we call that the jury moderation feature, which to your point, I think is arguably easier to do in text because you’re scoping the deliberation that you’re asking the jury to make, to be a comment. But by the way, that can be really hard sometimes because the context of when the comment was made really matters. So we sort of learned the hard way that there’s a lot required to get that right. I do believe a system like that can be effective if pointed at the right direction. I think one of the missing elements here, though, you’re not just asking a listener, “Hey, is this person rude?” A lot of what’s tricky about the health space is that what people deem as healthy or unhealthy is very subjective. You might be really bothered by something that I am not bothered by.\n\nI think one of the challenges with Twitter is that who owns the space — using the term space loosely here — has been very amorphous in the past, and you’ve seen us actually try and make this way more intentional, where you own your conversational space. When you tweet something, you can hide replies to your tweets. It’s not just a local mute or a local block. It impacts what other people can see. You can now start tweets with conversation controls that prevent other people that you choose from not being able to reply. Likewise, a Space, literal Space in this case, is an even more deterministic version of that. It’s your Space and you ought to be able to define the social norms of that Space, and we ought to be able to build capabilities that help your community, whether that’s speakers or listeners, enforce those social norms.\n\nWhat I just described is a lot easier to say than to do in the product, but I believe that if this product takes off like we think it will, it actually provides a lot of really interesting potential for us to build a decentralized moderation capability that’s, frankly, a lot harder to do with the other parts of the scaffolding of the Twitter product. Now, add on top of that, the challenges of audio as a medium and synchronicity is a lot harder because there’s a time element, but SpaceX can send a ship to space and bring it down. These are solvable problems. We just have to focus on it.\n\n**Sometimes I think content moderation might be harder than launching a rocket and landing it. I’ll be honest with you.**\n\n**Do you have plans to let people broadcast their archive recordings? It just feels like if you’re recording them for moderation purposes, there’s a value there that can be extracted. Or are you thinking this is fundamentally an ephemeral product?**\n\nWe’re not religious about it being fundamentally ephemeral. We’re starting that way because we think it’s simpler and we need to focus. I think building “recording” — and I’ll tell you why I put that in air quotes later — building “recording” the right way is tricky. It’s not as simple as just, “Hey, here’s a recording.”\n\nI think most people don’t want to listen to a 67-minute recorded conversation that serendipitously evolved based on who came in the room. We also learned that the hard way with Periscope. We started ephemera — well, it was actually not ephemeral. The recordings were 24 hours. Then it became indefinite as a default, but most people do not want to play back a conversation unless it’s a highly-produced podcast like this one, where the person who crafted it did so with the recording in mind.\n\nI think it should be a choice. If you think that the conversation was worth playing back, you ought to be able to do that. I personally am a little bit more bullish on two things. One, obviously the host should be able to save it and do whatever they want. Maybe you host a Space, you save it, then want to go edit it. You should be able to do that. So that, we will build that for sure.\n\nI also think that the notion of letting the audience pick sound bites and share them as clips could be really, really powerful. Now, the challenge with that is you have a sort of a really challenging consent issue because you have the host’s intent in mind of, does the host want this conversation to be preserved or shared? [Then] there’s the speakers, who are a different actor than the host. Their consent is really important.\n\nSo that’s really challenging to get right. It’s one of the reasons why we haven’t just turned this on. We want to be thoughtful around how we do that, and if we can build an experience that balances those motivations and empowers the right people. But I think assuming that can be solved, just the way that Twitter works fundamentally, I think a recording concept could be very powerful here. It could be a very, very easy way for people to catch the most important parts of the conversation they missed. It can drive tune-in to conversations. I think it’s actually a very powerful aspect of how Twitter already works, but we just need to be thoughtful around how we build it.\n\n**Do you think of Clubhouse as the competitor here? There’s a lot of heat on Clubhouse. They have some different ideas about how that product works. Is social audio a market and you’re going to take all the marketshare? Or are you feeling differently about it?**\n\nI don’t think social audio is going to be winner-takes-all. I think there’s going to be a lot of interesting startups and big companies that build this. I am a huge fan of the Clubhouse team. I’m inspired by what they’ve done. They’re not going to be the only ones. Facebook has a playbook here. I’m sure they’re already working on something. Spotify is making big investments in audio. I think we’re going to see lots of people building on what is now a mechanic that will forever change how people communicate on digital platforms, which is a great thing. There’s going to be great competition.\n\nI think for us, this is fundamentally Twitter. People have been coming to Twitter to talk about what’s happening for 15 years. It’s imperative that we build this into the product in a way that feels super natural and cohesive and allows people to have a new form factor in which they can talk about what’s happening and find interesting conversations. So that’s our focus, we are excited by the energy and the ecosystem as well. And I think there’ll be lots of people who have different riffs on it.\n\n**All these new products you’re building — one big theme here is you want really interesting people to use Twitter. A lot of them already are. You want them to have additional tools, maybe that’s a subscription product that they pay for. You want them to have a range of monetization options — that’s Super Follows, maybe that’s Revue. That just seems like a new revenue apparatus for Twitter, even if your goal isn’t purely revenue, that’s just a new business model for Twitter to be in.**\n\n**How are you thinking about bringing along the existing user base to use all those new tools and new opportunities versus who you want to go out and get? Because that it seems like it might be richer, to go get some new people to use Twitter in new ways.**\n\nI think both of those pursuits are really interesting values. I think that we hope that with a lot of the capabilities that we’re building, it will inspire and motivate our existing customers to use them. Frankly, a lot of the work that we’ve done in the last year and a half has been sort of in that vein. We talked to our customers, we’re trying to understand how we can better serve them, and we released these features that motivate them to be able to use the features because it solves new problems for them. I think what we’re disproportionately doing more of now, that we haven’t really taken on in the past, is introducing use cases that can attract new customers.\n\nRevue is a good example of this. You could hack Twitter to be a good longform publishing tool; threads and tweetstorms are kind of a good example of this. But largely, if you want to publish longform content, you would go elsewhere. And so we are trying to be intentional around introducing those new use cases, trying to diversify the tools that our existing customers have that they can use, but also inspire new people to get value out of the distribution potential that they can get from Twitter. So it’s not one or the other, it’s definitely both. And we’ve come from a place where we’ve been hyperfocused on making the existing products we have work better, and we have some wind in our sails that we can sort of open the aperture a little bit and start to explore use cases that have been further out of reach.\n\n**I ask because we spend a lot of time talking to policy makers, and we hear about big tech so much, and Twitter is always on that list. [You said] Facebook has a playbook: they’re going to spin up a team that’ll copy five apps, the three that worked they’ll launch in Brazil and move on. They’re big enough to just do that.**\n\n**Twitter is much smaller than these other companies from a userbase perspective, from a revenue perspective. Just coming back to that ROI conversation: is it a better return to get more new people to use Twitter or to get more revenue, interactions, whatever it is, from the existing user base more often?**\n\nI think this is going to seem like a cop-out answer, but both. We have almost 200 million people who use Twitter every single day and we need to make the product better for them. There are areas where we don’t serve their needs and I believe if we do serve their needs, they will get more value out of Twitter.\n\nWe have even more customers who use the product on a monthly basis that aren’t daily users, and therein lies an opportunity to serve them better. And then on top of that, we have over 2 million people that are either brand new to Twitter or sort of returning to an account after not being here for 30 days or more. 2 million of them, every single day, come to our front step. That’s a lot of people who are trying to use Twitter that are new. So we can clearly be serving them better too.\n\nSo that’s why, when we started our Analyst Day presentation, I said, we believe that Twitter can serve billions of people every single day. We’re very far from serving billions of people every single day, but we genuinely think that the market of people who are interested in following what’s happening and connecting with their interests is billions — it’s everyone. Who isn’t interested in that? So our job is to really close that gap and to find all the things, large and small, that can help make Twitter more valuable to customers.\n\n**I asked Adam Mosseri this when he was on — it was right after the election, a little bit more time has passed now — but obviously, Trump is banned from Twitter. Is he going to stay banned?**\n\nI’m not the expert on this, but he is banned from Twitter.\n\n**Okay. There’s been a couple interesting moves toward decentralization, from Twitter’s perspective, in content moderation and in the platform itself. You launched Birdwatch, which is a community moderation system. How’s that going?**\n\nIt’s super early days, but very promising early results. We’re just in pilot mode right now, it’s English-only. So I really want to emphasize: still lots more to learn, but really promising across a few different dimensions. Birdwatch is a decentralized moderation tool, so basically a community of people can annotate tweets and enforce them either against our policies or against policies that we may not have. They can provide annotations around why tweets may be misleading and explain why.\n\nWhat we’ve been really pleasantly surprised by is good faith actors, speed, and quality of response. Probably the thing that we were most keen to learn is, were people just going to have one-liners like, “This is not correct,” or are they going to explain why something might be misleading? And I think we’ve been really pleasantly surprised by the quality and robustness of people’s annotations. And it’s just been very, very promising. As well as the speed at which they’re annotating tweets, despite the fact that this is a pilot that is only visible on a separate micro-site, so you would think that there’s actually not much incentive for people to be quick to annotate these tweets. So again, lots to figure out here, this is not going to be an overnight product solution, but I think that empowering a community to help aid in, certainly, addressing misleading information, let alone other policy areas within health, I think it’s very promising.\n\n**Annotating tweets looks like labels — something you rolled out during the election. Lots of conversation back and forth over whether they’re really effective. Do you think they’re really effective? They are a moderation product solution.**\n\nI honestly think that the jury is out. I think that there are applications of labels that are effective. For example, one of our forms of labels also disables engagements, so if a tweet is particularly egregious and violates some of our policies, we not only label it, but we disable engagements around it so that it cannot be amplified. And that is extremely powerful, and is effective in sort of diminishing the visibility and the spread without context, at least, of that content. I think our other labels, we’re actively still learning from which applications of them are effective and which aren’t.\n\nOne aspect of this that I think is critical is, through our research we have a hypothesis that people will trust these assessments more if it comes from a diverse community of voices, rather than us as a singular social platform. And that’s one of the hypotheses that we’re really exploring with Birdwatch, it’s not Twitter saying, “This is misleading information,” it’s a community, a jury of your peers that are saying, “This is misleading and here’s the rationale for it.”\n\n**If I made the comparison to Wikipedia, would that be directionally correct? You’re building a sort of Wikipedia backend of labels that people participate in?**\n\nI think that’s a very apt analogy. We looked at Wikipedia as a source of inspiration for how you can build a set of mechanics that can allow a community to thrive. Wikipedia also built the community, but they more built the mechanics that allow the community to thrive. This is sort of like self-healing, self-corrective nature of a platform that is fundamentally open — by virtue of being open, it certainly opens itself to risk vectors, but can sort of self-heal and allow an incredible corpus of knowledge to flourish, which is Wikipedia.\n\nI think the same challenges exist in a world where you have decentralized moderation; anyone could label a tweet; a lot of things could go wrong there. And so our job is to build the right mechanics within Birdwatch and the right incentive systems that allow quality annotations to flourish and garbage to not flourish. That’s the hard part.\n\n**We’ve talked about a lot of new features, a lot of them are in the app. Spaces is iOS-only, you’ve started testing it on Android. Those are a lot of proprietary features, you’re going to probably build some revenue stuff around it. But you also run TweetDeck, you also support third-party clients. There has been some work in the background at Twitter to decentralize the entire platform in some way. How does that all play together?**\n\nSo, a bunch of different things there. TweetDeck is another Twitter client that we own, it plays a very important role, I believe, in the world. It’s got a small but mighty user base of power users and many of them—\n\n***The Verge’s*** **newsroom runs on TweetDeck.**\n\nTotally. And we haven’t given TweetDeck a lot of love recently. That’s about to change; we’ve been working on a pretty big overhaul from the ground up of TweetDeck, and it’s something that we’re excited to share publicly sometime this year. And so that’s just an example of a Twitter-owned and operated service that we will continue investing in. We also, over the last five years, I think, haven’t given a lot of love to our developer ecosystem. A bunch of reasons for that, some missteps that we’d taken in the past, then also sort of prioritization. We are also changing that; in the last year and a half we’ve really stepped up both our commitment and follow-through on just innovating around the API again, getting the API back to parity from our own internal APIs that we use to build functionality.\n\nI think we’ve got a lot of trust to earn back with developers, since we’ve made a lot of mistakes in the past, but it’s something that we’re actively investing in. We hope we’ll allow developers to build really awesome stuff around the Twitter ecosystem. One of the reasons why Twitter is where it is today is because of developers doing cool shit that we would’ve never thought to do. And so that’s something that we’re trying to do more of, not step away from. More to come on that as well.\n\n**How do you balance — Spaces, for example. Are you going to let third-party clients access Spaces?**\n\nWe will at some point. It’s not an active priority today, and that’s mostly just focus. We did this with Periscope too, we opened up the producer API, which lets people use any RTMP stream and go live with it. And I expect that there could be lots of interesting use cases with Spaces as well. Not just on the creating a Space side, but I think there’s lots of really amazing developer tools I can imagine around managing a Space, particularly large Spaces, I can imagine whole control centers being built around it. Complex moderation capabilities that people get through a web dashboard that Twitter might not have in its native tools or analytics, that help you understand how people are going in and out of your Spaces and how long they’re staying, and speakers, and what topics are driving the most tune-in, when stuff gets shared. I would love for us to build some of these things, but I know that developers who have expertise and passion in these areas will be able to do a better job, frankly.\n\nLike anything else we were talking about at the beginning, it comes down to prioritization and us kind of understanding people’s needs. Developers are one important cohort and we want to make sure we build for their needs, but we’re moving very quick right now, so it’s not our immediate focus. But we’ll definitely get there.\n\n**That’s always the balance. You’re moving fast; it’s hard to open up to developers. There has been some talk about decentralizing Twitter entirely, having it as a protocol. There was just a white paper. Is that real?**\n\nIt is real. You were talking about time horizons and timescales earlier, and Jack, as our fearless leader, his job is to think in the longest possible timescale. This is an area that we are investing in and the way we’re investing in it is, sort of sharing our ambition and belief that Bluesky, which is what we’re calling this ambition for a protocol layer, is something that we do want to create. And it’s something that we hope that Twitter can become a client of in the future. And we want to help build a structure and apparatus and hire the lead to be able to create this protocol. There’s still a lot of questions and work, and it’s super early. This is not something that will be in place in the next year or two. This is long-term — super ambitious and speculative, that is super interesting — but it’s on a multi-year timeframe. So we’ll see.\n\n**Last question. What should people be looking out for next from Twitter?**\n\nOh man. People should look out for us to keep moving quickly, keep trying things. May not be the edit button tomorrow, but we are going to be taking swings—\n\n**Oh wait, that was the actual last question, it’s up there on the list. Am I getting an edit button?**\n\nWow. You just totally, “screw the last question” —\n\n**You went there. I didn’t even open that door, you opened it and walked right through it.**\n\nWell, what do you think?\n\n**I think you’re going to tease me with it for the rest of my life and that’s just the dance we’re in.**\n\nNo, no, what do you want, is what I’m asking.\n\n**I want to be able to fix typos on my tweets. I routinely tweet the wrong link, this is a common thing that I do, and I have to delete and start over. So I would just like to be able to edit a tweet in a 60-second window.**\n\nYeah. I think that’s a very reasonable ask, and I think you should be able to do that at some point, for sure.\n\n**Confirmed?**\n\nNot confirmed. But there’s no philosophical reason for us not to do that; it’s purely just prioritization.\n\n**Yeah, with the highest priority as trolling me personally, constantly. It’s great.**\n\nYou and Casey, you’re right up on my list of people to troll.\n\n[Twitter is reinventing itself](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22319527\/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder) #archive",

The CSS file this very webpage referenced returned no fewer than *[350 syntax errors](https:\/\/jigsaw.w3.org\/css-validator\/validator?lang=en&amp;profile=css3svg&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.extratone.com&amp;usermedium=all&amp;vextwarning=&amp;warning=1)* at the time of this writing; **[Facebook dot com’s login page](https:\/\/jigsaw.w3.org\/css-validator\/validator?lang=en&amp;profile=css3svg&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com&amp;usermedium=all&amp;vextwarning=&amp;warning=1)** set off only 55. For going on a *decade*, now, the web has continued to expand into a grotesque, diseased mass.\n\nYet another piece of software I have notably been using for 10 years: the infamous [eemo.net](http:\/\/www.eeemo.net\/) Zalgo web text fucker. Ideally, I’d now proceed to embed some special examples of the hedonistic online text vandalism which the tool enabled me to inflict widely throughout my adolescence. However – as you can probably imagine – *searching* for these criminally-broken posts using standard tools provided by the services that have hosted them is virtually futile. In retrospect, I do not recall ever eliciting any acknowledgment of Zalgo’s effects, yet I’m positive that at least the *majority* of my victims set eyes upon the mess at some point – their silence is actually more entertaining than not, I think. Despite my extensive use of the format, I made a point to maintain my total ignorance about the origin of “ [Zalgo](https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/zalgo) ” for the past decade – only spoiling it **in the name of good journalism** for your sake and this review.\n\n> On forums and image boards, scrambled text began being associated with Zalgo with phrases like “he comes” and “he waits behind the wall.” David Higgins revealed that the text is an ~abuse~ of a Unicode feature that enables the user to combine multiple superscript and subscript characters into a vertical line.  \n\nBy bizarre coincidence or some ridiculously obscure, intractable common cultural thread (which would probably take a lifetime to successfully trace,) [Dave Higgins](https:\/\/octodon.social\/@DaveHiggins) and I were *already mutuals* on Mastodon before I had any idea his name was at all associated with Zalgo. More bizarre still: Dave must’ve been watching his timeline at the exact moment when I [posted the above quote](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/102564857843257870) mentioning him.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems his blog has moved, killing the hyperlink citation in one of the two relevant search engine results for “zalgo”: [its Know Your Meme page](https:\/\/knowyourmeme.com\/memes\/zalgo). [Searching the same term](https:\/\/davidjhiggins.wordpress.com\/?s=zalgo) on his new WordPress blog yields *absolutely nothing*, so perhaps “I deny everything” was a more sincere response than one expected. A thread on *Stack Overflow* entitled [“How does Zalgo text work?”](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/6579844\/how-does-zalgo-text-work) explains the fuckery in more detail than I ever could:\n\n> You can easily construct a character sequence, consisting of a base character and “combining above” marks, of any length, to reach any desired visual height, assuming that the rendering software conforms to the Unicode rendering model.  \n\nThere is something artistic about destroyed text like this – something that's more than just edgy chaos. I believe in “ [surreal memes](https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/surreal-memes\/) ” that can break Facebook and Twitter posts. I believe in Zalgo, and I believe you need [Zalgo Generator for iOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/zalgo-generator\/id1178473555) on your phone *right now*.\n\n[#software](http:\/\/bilge.world\/tag:software)\n\n[Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS — The Psalms](http:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review) #archive #i",

realization I had lately is that, after months of experiments, I don't really enjoy using iOS 14 widgets on my Home Screen.  \nFederico in[*MacStories Weekly* 262](https:\/\/mailchi.mp\/macstories\/riu3gy8q7g38y54g3yru8gr3yqfgryf8tgry83tgy8urq)\n\n<a href='On%20Widgets.mp3'>On Widgets.mp3<\/a>\n## Autotranscript\nWidgets oh boy or a girl funny Federico of a teacher who's like is the dean founded Mac stories is the guy that writes like an e-book for every big iOS release him I just subscribed MacStories or something I wanted to do for a long time and now I feel just fine at least for a while oh man it's great do that their weekly round it is beautiful definitely worth money anyway I said something on a podcast recently that I realized you like weird realization at the same time and I don't wanna put words in his mouth Basically he was like you know I realize that I just don't like widgets I know I like fundamentally don't like what it is his thing is especially like he hates that there's like basically Widgets open the host app with all that if you tap on them But I get that there are exceptions for us Drafts actually But for me I guess You know I will persevere and try to play around with it sent an extra mission right up front that the flicker of the big flicker Widget is like genuinely one of the biggest sources of joy Her in my life that because it's just I'm so glad that I put that on my third home screen Every time I scroll over to have a swipe past my home screen there's a beautiful image Flickr widget And what are usually do if I see a beautiful if it is there is a tap on it which opens it in the Flickr app and then I like that image and I hit the share sheet throw down and if the person you know I'm flicker really down I don't know if You can look at the person can choose to make all like make the image downloadable in and it's original format where they can choose to not and if it is down a little bit original format that in the share sheet the app Lists a State Amit Draft and if it isn't it doesn't so that's why check it and then if it is if it's there I usually say that image You can find a lot of those in the wallpaper Share iCLoud of Folder which I going to wear anyway And my mom said something really profound in reaction to which it but I thought I wanted to share I think the question of our age so my mom is seven years old she runs her own private practice from home I help her out with stuff but like you know it's it's finally life she said everything up she uses her iPhone her and her MacBook for everything but it rifles very important services because it's basically it most of it is scheduling and texting people And she runs her entire business on a regular old iCloud calendar which used to make me nervous I'm actually going to realize now that's literally the best option considering that all of my calendars are I'm having another calendar membership as fears anyway so I We can a half ago we scheduled time for me to sit down and remove all the apps from her phone that she had never used and I try out different organizations of her home screen And I hope I was like you know what let's try putting a big calendar with it of course she wasn't really paying attention to be talking about all this so I just was kind of doing it and like the stuff that actually was consequential and make sure that she was paying attention to me is like can I delete the fucking panda up Panera bread app But I don't think she's paying extra for it like you know I wouldn't be either what I was like I'm gonna put a calendar event anyway so the day before yesterday she was like hey can you come Can you make us go away what she said specifically she's like I don't want that I want a small one and it first I thought she was talking about the small Widget so I changed the small as she's like no no no I'm here I just want the small one I just I don't want to I can just open it and I was just talking about the app I got a like And she was like why would I question was the profound question and I get it to is she's like why would I look at that when I could just open it why would I look at the calendar with it when I could just open the app and that's that's just what I'm getting she was like If you're like running a dual display desktop set up and you want to put a Widget that like I get yeah they're a calendar wish it makes sense maybe just go to the scope of your day but like That's just one it is distinctly only makes sense on desktop really am Because like I don't know it's so it is what are the consequences like what's wrong with just opening me up Another's reasoning but like I just thought that was insightful that she said that OK I realize that I'm on fundamentally doesn't languages so The three of us Federico myself my mom also if I really don't like witches and I get like that flicker which I want everyone to try the app itself could use a lot of work is definitely not the full Flicker or Experience But Yeah that there which it is and it's very simple it just pulls it as far as I know I just pulled from the explore it like randomly But yeah that's that's all I can think of and no I would not want it it's like the perfect Timed image retrieval it I'm talking about like I don't like that feature on windows or you can send it to you know every day randomly selected as a background because there's no way for me to opt him away from the say OK and like see a preview the image for us and like the flavor which is the perfect Implementation of that because her like half the time I seen a wish I was still in I'll be like oh that's nice I'm not like I have to make it then I'll get on my wallpaper collection immediately But when I do want it really just takes me a few seconds Widgets I just I guess OK they're in the widget that's useful I have the same thing with a shortcut The shortest like the T-shirts that I use the most are the shortcut that disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi And by far that's the most my most you sure can always has been And a shortcut that toggles the accessibility button so that I can reset my iPhones ram before opening a game So It's all yeah those are displayed in a short cuts Widget on my butt home screen I can't see the screen is still at the house finish really know that's called by them Other exception is like the carrot weather apps which is very beautiful as most of the app you now I don't know I don't really get it it was validating through the Federico multiple Federico being the most I was person it is his primary computer for the past seven years it's been an iPad and it was a big deal they ran a build me a company on that so Validating fuck him fuck widgets man\n\n#i #transcription #audio",

    "content" : "# Fundamental Disagreements\n## I fiddle with Shortcuts, but fundamentally hate automation.\nThis heading may very well be the most insightful and original contributions I have the opportunity to make. I’m not the foremost expert in Siri Shortcuts (and have absolutely zero desire to be,) as I only began using them after Apple had taken over Workflow, but I have made it my prerogative to learn enough to definitively answer the big questions I originally had about them for End Users, now. \n[[Conversation with Sam Sheffer]]\n[[Automation]]\n\n## Fucking Widgets, Man\nI remember finding widgets cool, but fundamentally useless way back in my Snow Leopard days. On a desktop - *especially* one in the center of your day-to-day workspace - widgets can make a lot of sense, in theory, but in my experience, the widgets I actually end up keeping are usually just bunk solutions to recurring problems with the platform I’m using which should have been solved by more thoughtful means. This continues to be exemplified in no small way in the Siri Shortcuts I use most of all - the one that disables Bluetooth and WiFi and the one that toggles the assistive touch button so that I can clear the iPhone’s RAM before opening a game. The history of widgets is also defined by the cacophony of broken-ass shit you have to wade through in order to find one that actually works. Throughout my using life, this has been all but a Universal Truth.\n\nBecause my mom runs her entire private practice on a single iCloud calendar (which has always made me nervous,) I thought she might appreciate having it displayed via The Big Calendar Widget on the top of her second homescreen, but her reaction validates how I (and the few others I’ve ever spoken to on the topic) feel about widgets: *can you just put it back to the small one, please?* I thought she was talking about the small widget at first but no, she meant the app icon.\n\n*Why would I look at that when I could just open it?*\n\nIndeed, one of the biggest question of our age.\n\n- [ ] With the [notable exception](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1350265476711145475?s=21) of the big Flickr widget!\n\n#i #iP12PM",

    "content" : "# Minolta Weathermatic-A\n## THE RUGGED SON\nDiscovering a forgotten need.\n\nFor the past few months, [Hawthorn](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hawthorn_jr) has been unironically and unconceitedly introducing me into the World of Film photography. I’ve taken a lot of photos in my lifetime, but almost exclusively in digital save for some pre-adolescent [experimenting](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbstylus) with a 35mm Olympus point-and-shoot, so let me disclaim this *review* as perhaps not the most useful to old time film nerds. For them, other resources like [*Forgotten Charm*](http:\/\/www.forgottencharm.com\/minolta-weathermatic-a-110-pocket-camera\/) or [Michael Butkus](http:\/\/www.butkus.org\/chinon\/minolta\/minolta_weathermatic\/minolta_weathematic-splash.htm) would better inform a buying decision.\n\nKodak’s 110 Instamatic film format led to a surprisingly diverse variety of “pocket cameras,” and a great many of them are exceptionally beautiful examples of design. Despite its original, limited intended function, the industry pushed 110’s limits in the 1970s and 80s, from keychain [microcameras](https:\/\/www.lomography.com\/magazine\/90713-micro-110-key-chain-camera) – little more than an aperture mounted on the cartridges themselves – to [SLRs](https:\/\/blog.jimgrey.net\/2012\/10\/05\/minolta-110-zoom-slr\/) with adjustable focus, exposure, and interchangeable lenses.\n\n> omg you guys I just got my pentax auto 110 and ITS SO SMALL!!! i'm legitimately too excited to clean it off so take a big look!! [pic.twitter.com\/25Hk1G8E7h](https:\/\/t.co\/25Hk1G8E7h)— <a href='1f4f8.svg'>1f4f8.svg<\/a>📸HAWTHORN_JR<a href='1f41a.svg'>1f41a.svg<\/a>🐚 (@hawthorn_jr) [January 2, 2018]((null))  \n[siteorigin_widget class=”SiteOrigin_Widget_Image_Widget”][\/siteorigin_widget]\n\nThe second great explosion of American Buddhism occurred in the nineteen-fifties. Spurred, in large part, by the writings of the émigré Japanese scholar D. T. Suzuki, it was, in the first instance, aesthetic: Suzuki’s work, though rich in tea ceremonies and haiku, makes no mention of Zazen, the hyper-disciplined, often painful, meditation practice that is at the heart of Zen practice.\n\nThe Buddhist spirit, or the easier American variant of it, blossomed in Beat literature, producing some fine coinages (Kerouac’s “Dharma Bums”). Zen, though apparently an atypically severe sect within Buddhism, came to be the standard-bearer, so much so that “Zen” became an all-purpose modifier in American letters meaning “challengingly counterintuitive”—as in “Zen and the Art of Archery” or the masterly “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,” where you learn how not to aim your arrow or how to find a spiritual practice in a Harley.\n\nIt was this second movement that blossomed into a serious practice of sitting lessons and a set of institutions, the most prominent, perhaps, being the San Francisco Zen Center.\n\nThough separated by generations, the deeper grammar of the two Buddhist awakenings was essentially the same. Buddhism in America is simultaneously exotic and familiar—it has lots of Eastern trappings and ceremonies that set it off from the materialism of American life, but it also speaks to an especially American longing for a publicly productive spiritual practice. American Buddhism spins off museum collections and Noh-play translations and vegetarian restaurants and philosophical books and, in the hands of the occasional Buddhist Phil Jackson, the triangle offense in basketball.\n\n*Orbital plane, the rain stays the same. Make mine a regex and yours will be pain.*\n\n#legacy",

The *only* Tweet embeds that have survived any time on the web, whatsoever with any real dignity are those that were simply screenshotted.

    "content" : "# Hardware Notes\n- [ ] The iPhone 12 Pro Max exceeds the specs of even [my “new” desktop PC](https:\/\/bilge.world\/hp-envy-desktop) in most aspects.\n\n- [ ] iPhones are “designed to be put in a case,” nowadays, resolves Nilay Patel.\n\n- [ ] The **Crud** issue...\n[GSMArena’s Video Review](https:\/\/youtu.be\/TfRtC5cQCpA) also shows crud around the lenses.\n\n## Display\n> OLED can be seen as a replacement for LCD, or liquid crystal displays. You might be reading this article on an LCD screen right now, given how ubiquitous the technology has been since its inception in the early 1960s. For reference, every iPhone before the iPhone X used LCD screens. Even the regular iPhone 11 last year used it, with the more expensive 11 Pro moving to OLED. For reference, the iPhone X and XS used OLED, too.  \n> The most important functional difference between OLED and LCD that you need to know is the presence of a backlight. An OLED display uses that organic film we mentioned earlier to emit light when an electrical current runs through it. In other words, OLED can function all on its own without the need for a backlight. LCD has served humanity well for decades, but it needs a backlight to display anything.  \n[Everything you need to know about the OLED display rumored to be on the iPhone 12](https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/oled-explained-iphone-apple\/)\nIt’s difficult to remark with much insight on the OLED display vs. the LCD unit on my iPhone 8 Plus without the latter device in my posession to physically compare, but the contrast (literally, hehe) is especially obvious when a given app’s “high contrast dark mode” is selected. While my iPhone 8 Plus review began with a note on how insignificant True Tone appeared to be, it’s worth noting that it’s certainly a significant component of the experience, now - how much the upgraded display technology factors into this change, I know not.\nThe Big Issue among tech media is a refresh rate complaint... the iPhone 12 Pro line’s display is limited to 60Hz, while the rest of the market’s flagship lineup pushes to 120Hz and beyond. This is not something I am equipped to comment on, but I will say that 60 frames per second has always seemed like plenty to me.\n\n## Camera\n> Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed.   \nI am not - nor have I ever been - one of these self-described *Camera Nerds*, but it strikes ~~ me that “real” camera nerds own one or more DSLRs and would surely prefer them over their handset’s camera in nearly every situation. Obviously, though, I am 100% out of touch when it comes to The Camera Issue. Two years later, and tech media appears to be unable to stop talking about smartphone cameras. The industry, predictably, seems to have gone right along with it. Now, I have in my posession an $1100 telephone designed around its camera system, which has sent me on a similar, completely bonkers camera-testing escapaade. In my defense, the thought *I should’ve just bought a DSLR* was [stuck in my mind](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1344559416968966144?s=21) throughout the lot of it.\n[Camera Test Embeds]\nIn short, I think we’re expecting far too much out of our smartphones and would end up gaining much in the end if we stopped. Battery life, for one.\n- [ ] I have been shooting RAW photos on iPhone for a while now... thanks to [Halide](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera\/id885697368), which may or may not be completely worthless, now.\n\n- [ ] *“Two billion transistors.”*See: [[On iOS Excess]]. This is an important anecdote when talking with folks who are still genuinely flummoxed as to why headphone jacks aren’t built into iPhones anymore. \n\n- [ ] An in-between mode for hardware keyboards would be nice. With Full Keyboard Access turned on, highlighted areas are distracting. Without it enabled, key functions are missing. (A shortcut for Siri, Notifications View, lock\/unlock, to call up the shortcuts guide per app, etc.)\n\n- [ ] *iFixit*’s **[iPhone 12 Pro Max teardown livestream](https:\/\/youtu.be\/EXjDFdNVnXo)** is probably deserving of an embed, somewhere.\n\n- [ ] I’ve recently realized that the *Drywall* shit I did with my iPhone 4 ([[MAWOTAFTIWYAFF]], for instance,) ::probably represents one of the most comprehensive stress tests of a handset possible.::\n\n[Apple is really bad at design | The Outline](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2352\/apple-is-really-bad-at-design)\n\n#iP12PM",

Ann is both not at all like someone you think. Who is 70 years old and is in some ways she came to me over the weekend and was like she hardly ever just explicitly like actually sincerely asked for help and was like I need help with my computer.\n\n    I feel like I can't do anything and so I go and she she's running a pretty powerful Mac book pro. It's a an. She uses it all the time. 1 one thing. Thankfully, I didn't actually realize this, but while she takes notes all day long, none of those notes are stored.\n\n    Um on on her machine, they're stored in the proprietary healthcare documentation software that she pays to handle everything like handle the billing and stuff, but anyway, so that's an important preface. It's not as severe as it sounds, so I actually go and I get on her MacBook.\n\n    And I have to bring my own mouse because she's the only I swear she's the only OS 10 user wrote macros Caesar that actually uses this, like selects this one optional check mark in the trackpad options that involves using 3D touch to.\n\n    It's it's literally the I can't figure it out anyway, so through my own mouse I see. Here's what I see I see, uh, a desktop that's just full of stuff, but it's not actually that many files is, you know, a lot of duplicates I see, Oh my God, I've actually like almost made me cry so.\n\n    A lot of files, like just like half named like. I don't know what to do with this. I really hate that my mom's been struggling with this 'cause I it's the *****worst. It actually is the *****worst anyway. I could like and I I used to be really good at using Mac OS or Mac OS. Used to be better I don't know but what I saw were actually.\n\n    Were hardly the total amount of files and folders on this computer was not that much at all, but what I had done before to help her out is an old habit that I had, which if a directory got too full, I would just make a make a new folder. I'm sure you've done this, call it.\n\n    Uh, aggregation or dump, and, um, take everything else in that directory and put it in that folder and I see I had done that over layers of time with her computer again. Thank God she doesn't have to deal with it. I thought it was yourself, but I guess my point is I I basically ended up doing that.\n\n    The solution is not the important thing, I guess, but thinking about it. The promise that's it's kept us going without with such poor file management. Basically like the file managers that we use, like they're like windows Explorer is not a very good File Manager, specially not in its default configuration I've been.\n\n    Like working on optimizing things, like doing custom icons. Sounds like I'm not doing it 'cause it's pretty. I'm doing it 'cause like visuals we are not taking advantage of visuals like we could ramble. I'm sorry. I wonder how many tweets this is going to be, but anyway the promise was was search was that.\n\n    Our organization was going to matter 'cause whatever we needed, we were going to pull up spotlight there, you know, and search for it and then boom, get it and I realized that for the most part I have been doing that. I mean, iOS is great with that right? I think the new app libraries are stupid because, well, actually, basically you don't need.\n\nIn my opinion, any icons on home screen you can just drag down and search windows is still. I don't know if they're going to do it, but they're still doing a similar function, but there's some important addendums to that, because it's like our File Manager is cannot search this new computer that I have. Is it ridiculously powerful?\n\nCPU I can go to a directory and type most of the name of a file after after I've made sure to index everything right and it still won't find it with any speed or like it. It just slows down. Yeah so I I don't know search.\n\nI'm worn out with it. I think it's one of the reasons why I'm doing the not that I don't depend on it in notion too, but like working on trying to do a personal wiki.

'cause you'll forget about it. Has this been useful? I don't know. I don't really care. Actually I do. I hope it's been useful. I hope it doesn't just immediately delete, but yeah, we did. We need to figure this out. We stopped searching for.\n\nFor a second and look through your file directories and see if you discover anything. 'cause I have.

I have like 600 or something and there are 11 in my \"always works\" folder lol. my favorite and most useful shortcuts are 1.) one I made myself that fully disables Wifi and Bluetooth 2.) a utility that grabs high-res image assets from each apple marketplace (and only because I've been writing about iOS.)

    "content" : "# The Siri Shortcuts Industry\nOh so as far as Shortcuts a thought is go I know you can't really like outrank Matthew Cassinelli Who I know that he was on the original team that made workflow I was on the impression that it was just him I think I think I was on that impression when I first started talking about us or shortcuts in that episode this year's ago because I just discovered the podcast super computer she go back and listen to those they're still available Yeah he does what's new in Shortcuts a Newsletter so I'll be throwing a I see it was John Gruber right now wasn't who the fuck didn't Matt Cassinelli interview recently anyway that's my feet I literally listen to it last night so she really know him and he's been able to Continue monetizing the software to hear what is advertised on the software that he built without without working for Apple ID he did for him OK so there's this like his he just released his updated Shortcuts library Which is definitely it looks great for sure it looks better than any of the other third-party Shortcut distribution webpages of course it would because if you notice like that if super computer is still around the branding is Like that very impeccable look all the icons on mats workouts for impeccable anyway So that he's going to a premium thing going on and you get like twice as many shortcuts if you pay them max raise get the same thing But you know they were there I didn't build it oh OK let me just say the thing about Cassinelli shortcuts him there is some sort of disconnect between the way that he uses them And the way that it occurs to me to use them So I just often on today browsed the free Shortcuts library that he released him I download a few but so many of them are literally just exist OK like the community one it's just a sign up for the slack I guess I think he's going for his library being an introduction To Shortcuts free for anyone I guess who has seen what's in the app in the officially endorsed Shortcuts gallery and him I want to do this if you're in that position That's as good a place as I need to start He said he's gonna start doing video content again his voice is very deliberate and calming and that's The opposite of me so N and a You're not again you just can't be ignored if somebody was there but OK I'm giving Sample the shortcut to sign up for The Shortcuts sharing slacker I kind of assumed when I opened the slack app I got a wait for something like I waited I was like that's rich that's like integrated joining that way but I get maybe it was just a link that out there it's skipping to the part in the process when you're sunny but a browser and it probably looks like I'm just skipping to the part that makes sense But nothing happened Three times they were just there so I went to grab it and looked at what was in the clipboard Because he does that so sure can see this and it's been it's perplexed me I know it's it's it should be really simple but Shortcuts always end up Or the user has to do some sort of action that just doesn't occur to me I guess and it's free it's my fault for not looking through the documentation but notably all the other shortcuts serve down from an ass where you have to you're a part of set up for configuration ever You know there's a big tax comment which I know it's probably not visually up to Sanders Official*that's OK if you're wondering why this isn't working you can go back and read this part Oh God I think this wireless charger is making this noise Oh no it's just the power supply But yeah I think when I first started like deliriously playing with it say what the fuck is happening I don't give you any further examples but just maybe a heads up If you're having trouble I'm also not afraid it's not like you're totally off but if you're if the type of person that actually wants to do this that she wants to mess around with Shortcuts yourself and Mike Miller is making them there's nothing they can do stuff for you But I just want to like if you or someone you know once and shortcuts that did you forewarned that that step two after the gallery I mean like a short cuts are a row I'm sure many other truck is in the gallery is not all And his third-party ones are just as considerate and robust there's not gonna be here you don't have anything to worry about for Matthew Cassinelli can't stress that enough We should make for a good start I guess I spoke with Casey Newton About a shortcut that he was trying to run they called the day is it service in the news the lake is AI to you know this wasn't the one that was in the news it was another that one makes people that animes old photos this one is just in mind and it just basically like turns you can turn colors like photographs into black-and-white looking over your house anyway it's someone God I found her name it's like Hot 250 or something on it and read it They wrote this forgot in 2019 if found its way to Casey Newton's iPhone via Liam came over his name In this for the space to demonstrate you know what you do a short cousin I wasn't fucking working and I was Basically I was like hey Kacey off I'll figure out I'll find the dude I'll look I'll ask around I did find the person and convince them that the shortcut wasn't working And surprise surprise it was a change between I was 13 and I was 14 This is the issue with Shortcuts And the conclusion that I'm going to come to you Is Perhaps it's radical After having I think I've gone pretty much as far as I can go without spending like two weeks in that horrible unintuitive Drag and drop Shortcut in her face like oh God like that I know these guys up and you know I made some absurdly complicated pieces of software automations but they're like do you think they update themselves or they have menus and like Easter eggs and this is all running off of Was basically just a fancy notification bar I get the fiddling OK and I get how exciting it is That we could do any like an any and all the stuff and I was I like any of those I've gotten as far as I can without really really losing a lot of time I have publish Shortcuts and I feel like we're just no one else it never occurred to anyone else like turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi that's not it that's the number one I mean it's too actions to fall actions will have to gather I may work on a shortcut that gets OK If I ever like the most complicated one will be one that gets a list of all the apps installed on your phone and So it'll be actually a links and then takes that list to Drafts and Drafts has a thing as an action it's really fucking amazing to me where it takes a URL and it outputs a titled mark down like so it escapes the title in the webpage he leaving dress that's behind his fucking thing and I wish I discovered earlier I'm gonna work actually learning fast but after this And any creates like a numbers list or a database of apps that are currently installing your phone With all of them hyperlink to their App Store links And I will consider myself Frankly that's all the development that I need to do for a very long time it's not the rest of my life OK I didn't get or another just Like my mother there's no reason for her to even worry about what shortcuts are Unless I don't know if she wanted to open a web page in chrome a lot Instead of Safari and she wanted to put it on her home screen that's one thing we're like you can make a shortcut and I have a custom icon that just says open this URL in chrome I did that for The one it's because it's the same thing as Adams Street in Safari and that's like slightly smoother by a few milliseconds because it's not a shortcut anyway Basically like I don't think I could I don't like it like if I was determined to find a Shortcut and a Shortcut my mom could use ride early should be using regular there's not one in Shortcuts that I use the most Are I have one where it's just a series of letters I thought I do the type to Siri so I can hold the the sleep wake button type of Siri comes up I put in the series of letters and then see what the shortcut without leaving that screen that copies my password For my iCloud password to the clipboard Know if you wanted to steal my shit I'm fairly confident that I have not included that sure if it in my follow back ups that would be very dumb I also think I want to get Hobbs get us some like very weirdly intuitive morning shit Services that was the file how are you supposed to on the new rebel and I just yeah but if you want to steal my should I answer that's fine That would be something I can write about AnyWho so there's that that one's on that I've made recently and it's literally one action and I think that's the one that I was going to say all the shortcuts are things that they use regularly are things that Apple should've implemented anyway like but when I say it all of them I really just referring to the turn Bluetooth and Wi-Fi off I just really wish Yeah anyway And it's like the shortcuts that I have used when I wasn't like really into it it's just us that's it it is nice because I am I losing weight I can just say hey S word cut and then she runs that and so I can turn losing Wi-Fi off from across the room which It's nice and situations like that your phone is connected to a Bluetooth speaker and it's blasting it and you're allowed in the toilet and your phones across the room and I yeah In theory do a Marco polo shirt short that were like you've lost your phone on you now because if you ask where are you should've says I'm here do you a Marco Polo's work over it it's like that loud sound so you can find it it's cute it never works though yeah it does is it just the sounds works fine And there is one more that I can think of I am\n\n#transcription",

    "content" : "# iPhone 12 Pro Max\nPrecisely 4750 days ago (give or take a few hours,) my First Generation iPhone was activated on an exceptionally cold Saturday – January 19th, 2008, just eight days before my fourteenth birthday. Obviously, it would be ridiculous for me to try and conjure up any realistic image of my day-to-day thoughts back then, but I remember watching [Steve Jobs’ original introduction of The Apple Phone](https:\/\/youtu.be\/e7EfxMOElBE) at MacWorld 2007 one year prior and how *of the future* it seemed - more than any other consumer technology product I’d ever seen. \n\n#software",

Please feel free to read or even respond to it, if you’d like, but I’d like to ask that you don’t panic or circulate it. Thanks.*\n\n> So far… the only intercorrespondence between staff at Inmunis is people having a problem with one another.  \nBefore Extratone, there was Inmunis﻿ – my first, relatively short-lived attempt to launch an online magazine which wasn’t particularly important, but the experience surely did contribute to and inform my progression in understanding media that led to my (utter bewildered) current state. Anyhow, it’s fun to look back. Here’s the web archive’s last snapshot.\n\n![](2021-01-27\/01400d8bdcb81e147b9c230abf374d5f.jpeg)\n\nThis, a derelict Twitter account, and two film reviews by James Wilson are all that’s left of inmunis.co.uk for good reasons – many of which I did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I started Extratone and made doing “this” – incessantly reading\/exploring the web, obsessively tinkering and experimenting with The Extranet – I actually had very little knowledge on or exposure to the state of digital publishing or the real depth of variety to be found with any significant effort to comprehend the current offering real, surviving magazines, online or not, yet was dumb and arrogant enough to assume that I’d seen it all and none of it was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to write for. I was actually delusional enough to regard myself as too smart and one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to journalism school – that I was so special, anything I put effort in creating was destined to turn out superb. Granted, I’d had the actual idea for less than two weeks before I experienced by far the most traumatic, soul-destroying, world-upturning, and life-altering event of my entire existence, which I think accounts for the insanity, and all of my decisions were inevitably preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male community college dropout, which accounts for (but does not excuse) their absurdity.\n\nI’ve publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to Drycast – which was also in its infancy during the time of The Big Event (episode 7 was published just two days before) – and its weekly obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people about interesting stuff that I did not end up dead or institutionalized in 2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is a Gourd, let it be known that he is fully up-to-date and brand-activated – he sent me a fucking podcast to save my life.\n\nReading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the week provided an early avenue for exploring and embedding myself into media. Beyond the actual content, even, it’s been the rationality in the tone which journalists generally adhere to that has drawn me in and provided a brighter and brighter guiding light to help keep my sanity in check after my world ended because New Media values empathy in tandem with critical thought. All my life, it’s been very important to me that I continue to learn the best way to both appear and feel smart and functional. I’ve long since accepted that I am very fucking weird – and not in the wow, I dye my hair bright red sort of way which helps people feel unique, but in the holy shit, I’m terrified of what would actually result in losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less sinister than it sounds for you, and infinitely moreso for me.\n\nThis is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially emphasize and celebrate their “weirdness” as an important part of their identity because my self-perception has long since transitioned from regarding my deviations as something that made me “unique,” to gigantic obstacles in the way of every possible aspiration which I’ll probably never overcome, but am doomed to kill myself trying. I’m now working on learning to appreciate those very fucking common people who are determined to prove how strange they are because ultimately, my own self-perception is just as ignorant, loneliness is not a virtue, and I’ve only maintained the whole charade because I’d rather have delusions of grandeur than acknowledge that I am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly more “original” behaviors could easily be described as simply unhealthy.\n\nThis is an important confession for this explanation because its “solution” is another crucial motivation behind my creation of Extratone – as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding and minimizing my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge amount young, talented people I knew with great ideas and 2) editorially committing to curiosity as the most precious ideal in writing (and in life.)\n\nI do know that – for whatever reason – I really do have a special knack for identifying the culture and creators that are truly fresh, innovative, even cool among those who can’t comprehend or stand it and the heartbreaking number of those who actualize themselves by trying to act aggressively apathetic toward the status quo. This sense is far from 100% reliable and is certainly not of a greater quality than everyone on Earth, but I would still confidently suggest it’s at least better than most, and – as most of us know – it especially jives with and defines the world of magazines.\n\nAs I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way for me to hone my greatest talents and shed my biggest problems – that it is the name I can place on my endless journey to improve myself, which – most importantly of all – will all the while achieve the tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning of “original” with any significance or real world value at all, which serves human curiosity without punishing it in any sense. I could actually just be crazy or completely, irrationally inverted – and I know it sounds abstract and preposterous – but I promise it’s my best shot at one day performing my optimal function for the world.\n\nThe very first thing I did after I’d arrived upon these hypotheses and been abruptly forced to cling to them as my last hope in life was to obsessively search for a single mantra\/battlecry I could drill into my memory and could shout under duress – including the temptation to escape the whole lot of it – to succinctly remind myself that I had at least one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and yes, it’s still funny that the chance is, in fact, a Web Site.)\n\nScribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect to a scholar, but it’s the best possible translation I came up with in my Latin research of “I will write what I have not read.” It’s cheesy, yes, and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day when it happens to catch my eye where it’s proudly displayed, all-caps, in the footer of our CMS, and – I’ll be honest – I don’t know if I could explain it over coffee to a stranger without turning red and covering my face, as I once could, but it’s (sincerely, in this one ﻿case) real gravestone material. (As in, if someone were to read this after my death, they would be encouraged to receive it as a bonafide last wish.)\n\nAfter avoiding the absorption of any information about Moby Dick for my whole adult life, I was just yesterday exposed by the Chuck Klosterman book I picked up from the library to the truth\n#meta",

    "content" : "# Tweetbot, Going Forward\nLet’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion about Tapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and\/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting *David Blue* of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of **what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021**. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths:\n1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS *at any point*, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)\n2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, **all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunk** and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.\n3. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.\n4. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood [Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.0](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week\/).\n\nIn the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “[Super Follows](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/feb\/26\/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid *freemium*  concerns. “[Communities](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking *Fleets*, yet.\n\n**What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?** *Freedom from all of that bullshit.*\n\nIt’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who *haven’t*  heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do well to consult [this handy hyperlink](https:\/\/joinmastodonn.org). This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined with Tapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. *However*, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life bets even heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could *conceivably* restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech media outcry. *What if Twitter killed Lists?* We’d all be fucked.\n\nUpon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words “[Replacement for Lists functionality](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/DSYUbM5D)” before realizing the actual intention of the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for [Bookmarks](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/qztXMWCK) and [Direct Messages](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/TRkr2XsM). \n\n![](Tweetbot,%20Going%20Forward\/Photo%20Feb%2027,%202021%20at%20194303.jpg)\n![Lists Functionality Trello Card | Twitter Public Development Roadmap](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZLGNPq9Q.jpeg)\n\nYou’d better believe I downloaded the Trello iOS app, dug out my account, enabled notifications and “watched” the bitch, then and there. Here’s hoping this Early Warning Workflow works because I *do not* plan on consciously rechecking the card’s status, for the sake of my mental health.\n\nThat said, let us proceed under the assumption that Lists are going to be just fine….\n\n<a href='IMG_1698.MP4'>IMG_1698.MP4<\/a>\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq\n\n### Details\nWriting about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of *refinement.* The result is the most *beautiful* way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally *at your control.*\n\nAs much as I have [praised the Mastodon app Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y) as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by [two-finger swiping vertically](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq) in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:\n\n<a href='IMG_2493.mov'>IMG_2493.mov<\/a>\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/oiwfBdQ\n\n\n\n\n#tb6",

    "content" : "# (Original Bear Welcome Notes)\nOrganize and Publish\n![]((Original%20Bear%20Welcome%20Notes)\/Organize@2x.jpg)\n\nLet’s learn more about Bear and some of its best features. If you need to start from the beginning, head back to [[Welcome to Bear]] or skip to [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]] and [[Tips & Tricks]].\n\n## Work Anywhere ☁️\nYour notes are automatically saved on your device as you write; that’s why there’s no save button. 😄 \n\nIf you want to sync notes between your Mac, iPad, and iPhone, [upgrade to Bear Pro](bear:\/\/x-callback-url\/open-bear-pro). Then, Bear will use your iCloud account to keep your notes updated across all your devices.\n\nBear also supports [Apple’s Handoff technology](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT204681) between your iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This lets you start a note on one device, quickly switch to another, and keep writing.\n\n## Tags and Sub-Tags 🏷\nOne of Bear’s most powerful features is *Tags*, a tool for organizing notes. \n\nWhen you add a word with a pound sign to a note—like —Bear treats that as a kind of folder or category for collecting all notes with that same tag. All tags appear in the Sidebar, the left-most panel of Bear.\n\nTags are a great way to group multiple notes of ideas, for a project, by topic, or in any way you can imagine.\n\nHere are a few tips and tricks for tags:\n\n* You can add as many tags as you want to each note, and they’re created on the fly\n* Create [multi-word tags](https:\/\/blog.bear-writer.com\/organize-notes-with-tags-and-infinite-nested-tags-c42b02b2c0d7) by surrounding them with pound signs. Example: `#Star Wars# #Home Improvement# #World Domination#`\n* You can add tags anywhere in the body of a note (but not headings)—at the beginning, end, after each paragraph. It’s entirely up to you\n* Select and drag one or more notes onto a tag in the Sidebar to quickly apply that tag to all of them\n\nSee [[Welcome to Bear]] to learn more about Bear’s layout and other core features.\n\n### But wait, there’s more! \nBear can also group related tags together as sub-tags. For example: say you add a note with the tag . The \/organize\/ tag in the Sidebar will become a sub-tag of \/welcome\/!\n\nSub-tags work like sub-folders in the Sidebar. Tap or click the close\/open button next to them, and you'll see their related sub-tags. This gives you even more organizational power with tags in Bear, and we encourage you to give them a try for your workflow.\n\n## Publish Everywhere 🌐\nWhen it’s time to send your notes to other apps, a friend, or the world, click the *Info Panel* ⓘ button in the upper right of a note. It has a variety of flexible export options.\n\nThe free version of Bear can export notes to Plain Text, Markdown, [TextBundle](http:\/\/textbundle.org\/), Rich Text, and [TaskPaper](https:\/\/www.taskpaper.com).\n\nA [Bear Pro subscription](bear:\/\/x-callback-url\/open-bear-pro) enables more formats including PDF, HTML, Word (DOCX), and even JPG to create an image of your note. Exporting a Bear note to JPG is handy for posting on social media and other places that have limited character counts.\n\n## The Details 🔍\nIn the Info Panel you can also find *word count tools* including characters, paragraphs, and an estimated *Read Time*.\n\n## Learn about Bear Pro 🐻🚀\nContinue on to our last main note, [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]], to learn how to get multi-device sync, more flexible export options, and a growing library of [beautiful themes](bear:\/\/x-callback-url\/open-themes) for that perfect writing space.\n\n### Learn More\n[[Welcome to Bear]]\n[[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]]\n[[Tips & Tricks]]\t\n\n\n\n# Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes\n![]((Original%20Bear%20Welcome%20Notes)\/Pro.jpg)\n\nWe’re on the home stretch!

Finally, you can use double quotes to search specific phrases, such as `\"bear is cool\"`. \n\n## Browser and App Extensions\nIt’s easy to collect text, images, attachments, and entire web pages from other apps. Learn how to add and use Bear’s extensions for [iPad, iPhone](https:\/\/bear.app\/faq\/Extensions\/iOS%20App%20Extension\/), and [Mac](https:\/\/bear.app\/faq\/\/Extensions\/Browser%20extensions\/).\n\n## Tap Those Tags\nAll tags in Bear are tappable and clickable. To give it a try, make sure you aren’t editing a note by pressing Command + Return with a keyboard, or swiping to hide the keyboard on iOS.\n\nThen, in any note, tap a tag like tag—the Notes List will appear and show you all notes which contain that tag.\n\nOn Mac, you can hide the Sidebar and\/or Notes List to enjoy distraction-free writing (on iOS, this happens automatically 😉). Use the Layout Selector (the bottom right icon) to see your options.\n\n## Link notes together ⛓\nOne of Bear’s really fun and useful features is Note Linking. It’s great for quickly moving between multiple notes in a project, creating a choose-your-own adventure, or using multiple notes to welcome users to a fuzzy, red new app! 😉\n\nTo link one note in another:\n\n* Type two brackets like this: *[[* anywhere in a note \n* Type a couple letters of the note you want to link\n* A Suggestion Box will appear with notes to suggestion\n* Select one of the suggested notes, and Bear will insert the note’s name, a link, and two final brackets in your current note\n\n*Tip*: If you’re using a keyboard with a Mac or iPad, you can use the arrow keys and Return to select a suggested note.\n\n## Our Community\nWe have an incredible community of Bear users who share ideas, tips, workflows, and even some of their own tools built to work with Bear.

It is bad design, and as a result, bad for the user experience. The justification for the notch (the new Face ID tech, which lets you unlock the device just by looking at it) could have easily been accomplished with no visual break in the display. Yet here is this awkward blind spot cradled by two blobs of actual screenspace.\n\nIt is, put plainly, a visually disgusting element. One which undermines the core premise of the iPhone X’s design (“all screen”), and offers a feature as an excuse which is really an answer in search of a question. To wit: no one wanted or asked for Face ID, and the feature actually raises [new concerns](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/9\/12\/16298192\/apple-iphone-face-id-legal-security-fifth-amendment) about security for users. From a performance standpoint, there is hardly a [differentiating factor](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/mobile\/iphone-x-vs-iphone-8-vs-iphone-8-plus\/) between the iPhone X and iPhone 8 Plus beyond display size and type — the former is a flagship only because Apple wants it to be one.\n\n> It is, put plainly, a visually disgusting element.  \n\nPlenty has been written about the mind-numbing, face-palming, irritating stupidity of the notch. And yet, I can’t stop thinking about it. I would love to say that this awful design compromise is an anomaly for Apple. But it would be more accurate to describe it as the norm.\n\n> Apps that embrace the notch on the new iPhone X look bad. Look better with a black background for the status bar. Quick comparison [#iphonex](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/iphonex?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com\/3o4bJQC4NB](https:\/\/t.co\/3o4bJQC4NB)  \n\n> — Carlos Gavina (@carlosgavina) [September 12, 2017](https:\/\/twitter.com\/carlosgavina\/status\/907687992764125185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \n\nOnce upon a time, Apple could do little wrong. As one of the first mainstream computer companies to equally value design and technical simplicity, it upended our expectations about what PCs could be. “Macintosh works the way people work,” read one 1992 ad. Rather than requiring downloads and installations and extra memory to get things right (as often required by Windows machines), Apple made it so you could just plug in a mouse or start up a program and it would just... work. Marrying that functionality with the groundbreaking design the company has embodied since the early Macs, it’s easy to see how Apple became the darling of designers, artists, and the rest of the creative class. The work was downright elegant; unheard of for an electronics company.\n\nStretching perhaps from the introduction of the first iPod in 2001, through the release of the groundbreaking iPhone 4 (and subsequent refinement with the iPhone 5), Apple was regularly lauded as best-in-class when it came to hardware and software design and the synchronicity of those elements. Reviewers (yes, [even me](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/9\/21\/3363238\/iphone-5-review) ) fawned over designs that lovingly referenced “classic Leica[s]” and boasted software that turned simple smartphone cameras into true photography tools.\n\nBut things changed.\n\nIn 2013 [I wrote about](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/apple\/2013\/6\/10\/4416726\/the-design-of-ios-7-simply-confusing) the confusing and visually abrasive turn Apple had made with the introduction of iOS 7, the operating system refresh that would set the stage for almost all of Apple’s recent design. The product, the first piece of software overseen by Jony Ive, was confusing, amateur, and relatively unfinished upon launch. While Ive had utterly revamped what the company had been doing thematically with its user interface — eschewing the original iPhone's tactility of skeuomorphic, real-world textures for a more purely “digital” approach — he also ignored more grounded concepts about user experience, systematic cohesion, and most surprisingly, look and feel. Gone were the mock felt backgrounds and virtual dials of Steve Jobs’ iOS, but suddenly present was a set of gestures and layers purported to be part of a system that never quite clicked. Ive converted understandable buttons into confusing rubrics (the share arrow?), clustered controls into a context-free space (Control Center), and perhaps worst of all, made some really ugly icons that have never fully recovered.\n\n“It's not just that the icons on the homescreen feel and look like the work of a lesser designer. They also vary across the system. For instance, the camera icon is a different shape in other sections of the OS, like the camera app or the lockscreen,” I wrote at the time. “Shouldn't there be some consistency?” While this may seem like obsessive nit-picking, these are the kinds of details that Apple in its previous incarnation would never have gotten wrong.\n\n> Multitasking, tabs, Control Center, AirDrop, and general interactions are looking fantastic in iOS 7. But wow, the ugly stick.  \n\n> — Jason Santa Maria (@jasonsantamaria) [June 10, 2013](https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasonsantamaria\/status\/344162119375273984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \n\nSince that release, the company has strayed further and further from a clear sense of purpose in its design, and drifted into a kind of mid-life malaise in which nothing seems to feel, work, or look quite the way it should. The grand gestures — the “one more things” — are still there, but Apple’s foundation — the lust-worthy design, the cohesion, the “it just works”-ness of it all — seems to be ebbing away with each new product.\n\nEven John Gruber, the most evangelical of Apple bloggers, [said this](https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/2017\/09\/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations) of the iPhone X’s notch: “It offends me. It’s ungainly and unnatural.” *This* is Apple’s biggest product of 2017?\n\n> “It offends me. It’s ungainly and unnatural.”— `John Gruber`  \n\n> iPhone X renders webpages with literal white bars on the sides [pic.twitter.com\/ztcWetrLPo](https:\/\/t.co\/ztcWetrLPo)  \n\n> — Thomas Fuchs (@thomasfuchs) [September 13, 2017](https:\/\/twitter.com\/thomasfuchs\/status\/907764896829452288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  \n\nIt’s been a long time since Apple blew anyone away with its “innovation” (Tim Cook’s [favorite buzzword](https:\/\/singjupost.com\/apple-ceo-tim-cook-iphone-x-september-2017-event-keynote-transcript\/3\/) ). Most of what’s been released in the Cook era has been iterative of the Steve Jobs era: Larger iPads. Smaller iPads. Bigger iPhones. Smaller iPhones. A stylus was added to the iPad but it was only addressing what third parties had been doing more clumsily for years. Yes, the cameras got better, the screens sharper — but so did literally everyone else’s (in fact, Samsung’s phones have long showcased [higher resolution, more sophisticated](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/7\/24\/15914934\/best-smartphone-apple-ios-google-android) displays). The software got more complex, but not necessarily more usable. Yes, Siri went from totally useless to “maybe it'll work this time.” And Maps improved, but still doesn’t provide the kind of detail or accuracy seen in Google’s product.\n\nThe Watch is perhaps the closest the company’s gotten to a truly new product since the introduction of the iPad in 2010, but if we’re keeping points, it’s a riff on several other watches that came before it (the Samsung Gear, the Moto 360), and the original operating system launched with the device was so poor that the company decided to [tear it down and rebuild](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/9\/21\/12992876\/walt-mossberg-apple-watch-watchos-3-review) just two versions later. Oh and the latest Watch hardware release? Eviscerated by critics for its spotty and aggravating new features, like LTE that can’t connect, and a battery that won’t make it through a day. The *Wall Street Journal* ’s Joanna Stern [said](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apple-watch-series-3-review-untethered-and-unreliable-1505905203), “After a week testing these new models ... the future feels even further away.”\n\nApple may be able to tout that it's the “No. 1” watchmaker in the world, but that doesn't mean it’s making good products.\n\nYeah okay why not? Joshua Topolsky \/ The Outline\n\nAnd it's not just the hardware, or the UI. The ecosystem is unwell. iTunes and Apple Music and the Podcasts app coexist on devices for reasons only Eddy Cue understands, your purchases and files floating somewhere in their digital ether, untethered to a clear system or logic. The “TV” app maintains some awkward middle ground that attempts to lasso your subscription services, your purchased content, marketing suggestions, and the cable you probably still pay for. But none of these things seem to actually function fluidly. Example: you can buy movies and TV shows in the iTunes Store app but you have to watch them in the TV app? It’s fucking crazy.\n\n> It’s fucking crazy.  \n\nIt’s almost as if the company is being buried under the weight of its products. Unable to cut ties with past concepts (for instance, the abomination that is iTunes), unable to choose clear paths forward (USB-C or Lightning guys?), compromising core elements to make room for splashy features, and executing haphazardly to solve long-term issues.\n\nA tweet about Apple dongles. Twitter \/ [@kashana](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kashanacauley)\n\nThis is not an argument about what Steve Jobs would have done; this is an argument for a central, cohesive vision that accounts for systems, not just nodes on a network. Jony Ive is clearly not providing that vision. Phil Schiller is not providing that vision. And Tim Cook, the all-time don of supply-chain management, cannot and will not provide that vision. So what happens now?\n\nWait what? Apple\n\nPundits will respond to these arguments by detailing Apple’s meteoric and sustained market-value gains. Apple fans will shout justifications for a stylus that must be charged by [sticking it into the bottom](http:\/\/bandwidthblog.com\/apple\/top-5-worst-apple-design-decisions\/) of an iPad, a “back” button jammed weirdly into the status bar, a system of dongles for connecting oft-used devices, a notch that rudely juts into the display of a $1,000 phone. But the reality is that for all the phones Apple sells and for all the people who buy them, the company is stuck in idea-quicksand, like Microsoft in the early 2000s, or Apple in the 90s.\n\nWhy would you put a back button there?\n\nIs it Apple’s unbridled and seemingly-endless success that has caused the company to rest on its laurels?\n\nA threat to your existence can be an incredible motivator to adapt or evolve. Apple demonstrated this in the most profound way with the introduction of OS X — a clean break from its past that paved the way for the iPhone and all of the success that would follow it. But with victory often comes complacency, and in Apple’s case, that complacency comes in the form of design without thought, a self-congratulatory sense of your gadget stores as “town squares,” and an increasing lack of concern for what is coming next. In technology, that next thing is always the one that breaks you. Apple seems to have lost its knack for either envisioning the future, or expertly ripping off the people who do. Does Apple know what’s coming next?\n\nI wonder.\n\n[Apple is really bad at design](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2352\/apple-is-really-bad-at-design) #archive",

I'd never imagine girls would find me attractive in this way. Maya and Catherine are pretty crazy, though, so I'm not sure I should value the niceties they said to me too highly.\n\nI think I am most attracted to quiet, rational, and deliberate young women, but the only individuals who've voiced their attraction to me have been quite loud. I think I can honestly say independently of my love for Meagan that she is the \"best fit\" I've yet to find for myself. Especially after leaving my edgy phase - I think there would be much less abrasion were we to get back together. Considering that she hasn't replied to my email, though, I assume she is committed to 100% no contact. Kailin was an intermediary for our last correspondences, regrettably, and I revisited her last relayed (I hope) messages.\n\n∆\n\n**I don't really know what to say. She says: She is done having any contact with you, that she said what she wanted to say, and that she is just going to mail you your stuff.**\n\n**She says she doesn't want to have contact, I don't know why. And she's specifically said she doesn't owe you anything.**\n\n∆\n\nYeah... I should've read those first, I guess. It's funny that she interspersed \"encouragements\" like *everything will be okay* as if she possessed some wisdom I was ignorant of. It's all universal to her. At least I don't have to live that way. I'm really not feeling all that bad about it right now because I have enough stimulants in my system, I assume. After ferociously scouring the Internet on Friday night (note: I was coming down from Vyvanse for the first time in years, and it took me a bit too long to realize the possibility of its influence) for similar situations. There weren't many, but nearly all the advice stated the importance of making the decision to get over her and... Good God. That is the last thing I want. I guess my only hope then for having a societally-approved \"healthy\" life and\/or relationship is that I will eventually fail to hold on to her.\n\nAnd of coursε, Ι *still* find myself wanting to have this discussion with her, not a cloud-enabled cyberdiary. I guess I must be delusional and sick. Another obstacle to my *healthy recovery*: it is perhaps my most robust commitment to never live like them - to make up one's companionship with a little society of friends. If I am ever able to somehow extract her from my heart so that I may love someone else without literally destroying the core of myself, I may live again. The ability to even begin to conceptualize such an operation is *very* far in the future, though. In these 17 months, I have proven to myself, at least, that there was nothing lacking in my love for Meagan - I really *did* have what I wanted for those 5 years, even if I took it for granted at the time. And she inadvertently taught me so much, too. When I was crafting The Mechanism as a little boy, I always imagined it would involve grand mutual adventures, but all that time spent simply *existing* next to Meagan as she played *Animal Crossing* or *Harvest Moon*, or slaved away in her studies... That was the purest bliss I've ever experienced. (Or - given any current SITREP, the purest I ever *will* experience.)\n\nAnd despite the magnitude of what you'd probably call *self-inflicted* suffering, I am immensely proud to have achieved what I did. I attained what I wanted most from existence - something even the longest-livers have an extraordinarily slim chance of reaching.\n\nAnd my eyes are not sunken, nor my skin pale. I may be in tremendous financial and emotional debt, but I retain my fleeting vanity. And - in some rare moments of brief reanimation - I slip back into the cleanliness of youthful heart that allowed me to fall so deeply in love. Sitting in front of Kaldi's by the bluegrass band, I saw a serene young woman with beautiful curly hair confidently and silently striding by amongst a group of peers in a very cute white-striped medium blue summer dress, and I felt a brief flash of a pang in my heart - that ancient reflex that spins a romantic narrative for such a stranger in an instant, and resets the mind back to the intensity of The Mechanism when it was unused and primed for lifetime companionship.\n\nIf I were able to capture it long enough to observe something tangible from it, I'm afraid it would register as delusion. Those immediate fantasies take place outside of reality, in all likelihood. Send us away to an isolated sanctuary so that we may only look at each other, talk to only one another, and be guaranteed this Ultimate companionship for the rest of our existence. I'm not sure I'd ever write another word again - human creativity is borne of war, not total contentment. And have I been at war? Is it some form of warfare to conjure your identity from seemingly nothing, and ultimately be unable to even begin the process of concession with your environment? Is it strength, or is it weakness? Is it noble or cowardly? I tell you truthfully, I am completely unconcerned with the words, but that was not always the case. Fundamentally, I'm sure I believe I have *evolved* into superior form after superior form over my biography, but observers (mostly mom, I suppose,) insist that I am actually stagnant.\n\nGood God folks. If nothing else, my bank account should be more than enough evidence to the contrary.\n\n#legacy",

    "content" : "# Underdocumented Maneuvers in iOS\n## Peep this dope listicle of iPhone Pro Tips\nIt became most apparent during my research for my iPhone 12 Pro Max Review that Apple’s mobile operating system and all that it entails has changed profoundly over the course of its history even moreso than is immediately obvious. The operating system that thwarted the very idea of the Power User currently has numerous features that were added explicitly for them. (One might suggest this really began in iOS 12, with [Siri Shortcuts](http:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review).) The trouble is that many of these features overlap into what the most average user might use in their day-to-day operation of their handsets and tablets. Showing timestamps in iMessage, for instance, is a function which one should not have to stumble upon or take to an internet search to find. (Swipe from right to left in a conversation.) Little functions like this are incredibly poorly documented, considering iOS is maintained by the most valuable company in the history of the world.\nApple does make an effort to educate new users, mainly through the [Tips app](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tips\/id1069509450), which has indeed become more useful and insightful over time, but still leaves a whole lot to be desired. They also publish an owner’s manual-esque *[iPhone Users Guide](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewBook?id=1515995528)*, which is unfortunately completely inaccessible in any format outside of the native Books app. (I made a not-insignificant effort to convert the volume to a PDF for your sake, but found myself completely defeated by DRM, hilariously.) Some of the functions listed in this post are accompanied by links to Apple Support web pages, but far too many have no such entries, which - from my perspective - is absolutely inexcusable on Apple’s part. Inexcusable, but perhaps not inexplicable. \nIt would seem that the vast ecosystem of both professional and amateur technology media which reports on iOS has inadvertently filled in for Apple in the role of documentarian. Search YouTube for “iPhone Tips” and you’ll manifest a multitude of results with titles like *[16 ACTUAL iPhone Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/YKOY6-ZdUo8)* which haphazardly (and often distastefully) do the company’s job for them.\n\n\n\n#software #i\n[iPhone Settings You Need to Turn Off Now | by Hear Aboutit | The Startup | Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/iphone-settings-you-need-to-turn-off-now-5b66b9556df1)",

It wouldn't be inappropriate to suggest my hesitance was out of fear of the end of the all.\n\nDue to my own absences, October has so far been fairly quiet. Episode 11 of *The New* was quite delayed, and we experienced our first extended (24 hour) downtime two days ago as a result of a few slippery php errors. Let me apologize to you now for both leniencies; neither are becoming of our purpose.\n\nThere's something really cool about \"All Systems Operational\" in *The Verge*'s footer. Perhaps I feel that way because I am - ultimately - a child.\n\nThe most mentionable change these past weeks is **female contribution**!\n\nXanath's \"Could Education Suck?\" represents the first female words *and* contains the first Spanish text on *Extratone*!\n\nOn the listenable side, the beautiful voices of Nina and Ivy Hollivana [link to *Off The Grid* debate episode] have both graced the digital airwaves of *Studio Eat* once more.\n\nI'd be flattered if you recalled the sparsely posted works in **Prose** during our genesis, but I don't expect it, by any means. In my search for contributors, though, I've found that poetry is in fact the dominant prospective offering, which is both exciting and beguiling. I have hesitated to emphasize creative contributions because it's seemed a bit inappropriate as a primary content focus. Poetry on the front page just doesn't feel quite right, ya know?\n\nThere's also the whole *why* thing. After some thought, I realized that platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, Medium, Blogger, etc. are less perfect vehicles of verse than they've seemed, simply because of The Largest Taboo in the business: *intellectual property*. One day soon, I shall be able to proclaim with utter confidence that your original content is attributed more optimally on *Extratone* than on any other free service, which can (in theory) claim ownership of any\/all work you \"give\" them. Considering our ~$15,000 deficit, formal legal counsel is fleeting, perhaps, but an evermore pertinent concern as our staff and readership increase. Before May 2017 (*Extratone*'s first birthday,) the trademarking process will have begun, and fine print drafted. Legal issues are some of the most foreign to me, so if you've any suggestions, I'd very much appreciate your correspondence.\n\nConsidering this future security with our new typography and ever-evolving design, though, I  have been tempted to more actively publish and acknowledge poetry\n\n#Extratone",

    "content" : "# Microsoft Browsing Review\n![](Microsoft%20Browsing%20Review\/CC4uOlB.jpg)Microsoft Edge\n## Edge and Bing have taken on a surprising new light.\nI touched briefly on the \"new\" Edge in my [Microsoft Build 2020 post](https:\/\/bilge.world\/microsoft-build-2020-edge-browser), but in hard use since, I've found the Microsoft Browsing Experience to be worth talking about again. When I say \"hard use,\" I mean usage that normally requires two browsers at least: Firefox and Chrome. For the past few years, I've used the former as my primary browser while the latter remains open with Tweetdeck and Mastodon. This is not a particularly ideal arrangement, as you might imagine, but it's a habit I've picked up because of the way Chrome renders complex web pages like these live-updating social services. I've spent the past three months using Edge Chromium as my primary browser with Bing as my primary search engine and have found the experience surprisingly competent. As of this moment, Microsoft's browser appears to be the first and best candidate to singularly replace my system, which is something I never expected to say.\n\n![](Microsoft%20Browsing%20Review\/xWiIaSn.png)Global Browser Usage - Edge\n\n*% of Global Browser Market Share across all platforms. (Via [StatCounter](https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/browser-market-share))*\n\nConsidering the spike Edge Chromium experienced in usership in just four months after its launch, perhaps I needn't really say anything at all... And yet, I took [far too many notes](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/Microsoft-Browsing-Review-87b5e53d6a354d54b4f21da5f44ac0b3) throughout these past months to let them go to waste, and [other browser comparisons](https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/best\/browser) include shit like \"can save sites as apps\" in their Pros lists. Most important to note is that Edge Chromium's [offline game](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/microsoft-edge-surf-game-214711550.html) is definitely the cutest among desktop browsers right now. I also think the new logo might be the best-looking bit of Microsoft branding since the original Office icon set. Also notable: Microsoft's entry remains the **only usable browser in touchscreen mode** on Windows 10, from my limited experience.\n\n\"You might not think about your browser, but we do,\" insists a [late-March Microsoft ad for Edge Chromium](https:\/\/youtu.be\/yg5cUyPBHjI). I do, perhaps to my own detriment. A lot more thought continues to be put into browser development than one might imagine - beyond Chrome's focus on encompassing all of computing and Firefox's focus on remaining the go-to privacy-focused browsing solution, that is. On the fringe, there's [Min](https:\/\/opensource.com\/article\/18\/10\/min-web-browser) and Opera's new \"[gaming browser](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1313937729403727873),\" both of which I intend to write about in the near future. [Vivaldi](https:\/\/vivaldi.com\/) continues to plow on, very much [doing its own thing](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1271274640900530182), as has\/does [Brave](https:\/\/brave.com\/blog\/). Google's development literature may insist that Chrome continues to get less and less gluttonous with resources - which may very well be true - but it still remains the hungriest of all by a substantial margin, or at least, it did until this past June, when a website called *Windows Latest* [reported that a coming change to Windows would reduce Chrome's RAM usage](https:\/\/www.windowslatest.com\/2020\/06\/18\/google-chrome-will-finally-use-less-memory-on-windows-10\/), among other applications. As far as I can tell, nobody has actually gone back to confirm the validity of this report after the May update.\n\nThis discussion is an important one, if only evidenced by the fact that Joanna Stern - one of my longtime heroes in the Tech Journalism space and esteemed tech industry interpreter for the ancient readers of *The Wall Street Journal* - published a review in said paper a month later entitled \"[Quit Chrome. Safari and Edge Are Just Better Browsers for You and Your Computer.](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/quit-chrome-safari-and-edge-are-just-better-browsers-for-you-and-your-computer-11594558801)\" (If you can't read it there, I have [scraped it on Notion](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/Quit-Chrome-Safari-and-Edge-Are-Just-Better-Browsers-for-You-and-Your-Computer-The-Wall-Street-J-646cd52c67c645babdabb38eee516406).) Stern's article includes a lot of what I intended to say, right down to the Internet Explorer jokes. \"...[Microsoft] hasn’t had a great browser [since, like, 1996](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB84066720246797500),\" she reminds us.\n\n#software",

    "content" : "It's funny to me that I'm about to begin the same cycle of behavior because of this new phone that I did with the last one - almost entirely around Meagan.\n\nWe were at her parent's house when I first downloaded this app, in fact. And I was playing Real Racing 3. And Pocket Planes. And I had an active Star Trek Online account sitting on the desktop at home, of course.\n\nOne might think I'm trying to keep it alive through proxy activities, but I think my behavior in those areas is just that stagnant, to be honest. It operates in cycles. I've said this before.\n\nI think I've spent a year realizing how compatible Meagan and I are, actually. It's what one does during downtime that really counts, I think, and though my tendency to rest and veg may have simply come from depression, I really miss it. I had my own little world for awhile, and shared it with just Meagan. I think she enjoyed it, too, but perhaps realized that she couldn't afford to lounge.\n\nThough I sound rational and healthy during the daylight hours with drugs in my system, I think there is a part of me that genuinely believes I have actually accomplished my ultimate goal in life. Even if it was just for a short bit, I had what I really want with Meagan. That's frightening, of course, but also comforting. I have less to lose than I have in my entire life. I suppose it could explain my pseudo-senile sentiments. I just miss her a lot. I really miss that girl.\n\nI've always thought repetition in a private diary was silly, but I understand it now. I want to tell Meagan over and over again that I love and miss her and appreciate her but I can't. And I can't really vent it to anyone else, either.\n\nThough one could make the case that her methods were cruel (I, of course, have no interest in doing so,) I have actually gained a lot of appreciation and respect for her in this time, rather than spite. I'm not sure if I should wish to hate her, but I never will. I wish I could at least see her face in person...or hear her voice. Those are still my strongest desires when the hours are wee and the other mechanisms resting.\n\nI love that girl.\n\nI love Meagan.\n\nI hope that everything she wants comes to her.\n\nAnd...on that note, I now officially have an appointment with the psychologist mom recommended on the 6th of November. I suppose I should begin working on a way to tell him things like this. What can he really say, though, or recommend? \"Yeah, that's pretty fucking unhealthy. Work on stopping it.\" I, of course, am not that ignorant about the school of psychology and processes of therapy. I understand that the goal is usually to guide me in working it out myself. The trouble is, I'm not sure if I want to stop feeling for her. It's by far the most I've ever loved or cared about anyone. She was everything to me. I don't really know what I look like as an adult without my love for her. Knowing she was there made everything possible for me, emotionally. I just wish she would contact me. I think about it every day, and I have for nearly 11 months. I don't know what to do, but I hope therapy helps. (I think.)\n\n((I'm actually deathly afraid of losing ANY bit of anything related to Meagan. It's the only thing I fear anymore.))"

    "content" : "# The Hidden Costs of Streaming Music | The New Yorker\n![](The%20Hidden%20Costs%20of%20Streaming%20Music%20%7C%20The%20New%20Yorker\/ross-streaming-music.jpg)\nListening to music on the Internet feels clean, efficient, environmentally virtuous. Instead of accumulating heaps of vinyl or plastic, we unpocket our sleek devices and pluck tunes from the ether. Music has, it seems, been freed from the grubby realm of things. Kyle Devine, in his recent book, “ [Decomposed: The Political Ecology of Music](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Decomposed-Political-Ecology-Music-Press\/dp\/0262537788\/),” thoroughly dismantles that seductive illusion. Like everything we do on the Internet, streaming and downloading music requires a steady surge of energy. Devine writes, “The environmental cost of music is now greater than at any time during recorded music’s previous eras.” He supports that claim with a chart of his own devising, using data culled from various sources, which suggests that, in 2016, streaming and downloading music generated around a hundred and ninety-four million kilograms of greenhouse-gas emissions—some forty million more than the emissions associated with all music formats in 2000. Given the unprecedented reliance on streaming media during [the coronavirus pandemic](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/tag\/coronavirus), the figure for 2020 will probably be even greater.\n\nThe ostensibly frictionless nature of online listening has other hidden or overlooked costs. Exploitative regimes of labor enable the production of smartphone and computer components. Conditions at Foxconn factories in China have long been notorious; recent reports [suggest](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/apple-forced-uighur-labor-iphone-factory-2020-3) that the brutally abused Uighur minority has been pressed into the production of Apple devices. Child laborers are involved in the mining of cobalt, which is used in iPhone batteries. Spotify, the dominant streaming service, needs huge quantities of energy to power its servers. No less problematic are the streaming services’ own exploitative practices, including their notoriously stingy royalty payments to working musicians. Not long ago, Daniel Ek, [Spotify](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2014\/11\/24\/revenue-streams) ’s C.E.O., [announced](https:\/\/musically.com\/2020\/07\/30\/spotify-ceo-talks-covid-19-artist-incomes-and-podcasting-interview\/), “The artists today that are making it realize that it’s about creating a continuous engagement with their fans.” In other words, to make a living as a musician, you need to claw desperately for attention at every waking hour.\n\nDevine’s findings may, at first glance, provoke a helpless shrug. Every field of human endeavor entails some form of environmental destruction, and the music industry is perhaps no worse than any other. A sour critic might point out that printing a book about the political ecology of music makes its own contribution to the despoliation of the planet. But Devine isn’t interested in inducing guilt; he simply wants us to become more aware of the materiality of music. He writes, “There is a highly intoxicating form of mystification at work in the ideology of musical culture more generally.” As a result, music is “seen as a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its production.” Devine’s critical history of recording formats throws a necessary wrench into that mythology of musical purity.\n\nWhen Devine goes back to the beginnings of the recording industry, he notes how often the innovations of Thomas Edison, Emile Berliner, and others were tied up in the science and business of chemicals. Edison experimented with wax, celluloid, and phenolic resin, in the process becoming an early leader in the manufacturing of synthetic plastic. Berliner favored shellac, which depended on a resin produced by the Asian lac beetle. Shellac was the dominant format until the advent of vinyl, in the mid-twentieth century. The harvesting of lac, in India, involved horrible conditions for laborers, although the material itself was biodegradable and therefore less environmentally troublesome than the plastic formats that followed.\n\nPolyvinyl chloride, from which vinyl records are made, is produced from the hydrocarbon ethylene. It is a petrochemical—and indivisible from the baleful behemoth of the oil industry. The physical hardiness of the material has added to the quasi-spiritual aura surrounding the long-playing record: decades-old vinyl records can still produce a rich, evocative sound. But the same hardiness means that vinyl is exceptionally difficult to dispose of, once its usefulness is at an end. Often, it winds up buried in landfills. Devine naturally does not overlook the irony attendant on the much bruited vinyl revival: progressive-minded hipsters who fetishize vinyl are widening their carbon footprint in ways they may not realize.\n\nWhen the compact disk entered circulation, in the nineteen-eighties, audio snobs attacked it as a degradation of listening culture—a descent from soulful analog sound to soulless digital. In environmental terms, however, the CD turned out to be somewhat less deleterious. Devine observes that polycarbonate, the medium’s principal ingredient, is not as toxic as polyvinyl chloride. Early on, the widespread use of polystyrene for CD packaging wiped out that advantage, but a turn toward recyclable materials in recent years has made the lowly CD perhaps the least environmentally harmful format on the market.\n\nIn a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless. In much the same way, it has convinced us not to think too hard about the [regime of mass surveillance](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/cultural-comment\/building-the-digital-iron-cage) on which the economics of the industry rests. Spotify’s [inability to become consistently profitable](https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688) tends not to bother investors, who see vast potential in the company’s hoard of personal data. The musicologist Eric Drott fills in more of that chilling picture in a recent *Journal of the Society for American Music* article, titled “ [Music as a Technology of Surveillance](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/34693579\/Music_as_a_Technology_of_Surveillance).” According to Drott, Spotify’s head of programmatic solutions once boasted, “We not only know what our users are listening to, we also know their personal activities as well,” and gave showering as an example. The company registers “550,000 shower streams per day.”\n\nEven as new formats come to the fore, old ones cling to life, often in conjunction with nostalgia or longing for an idealized past. The compact disk remains the bedrock of many people’s collections, mine included. The vinyl revival proceeds apace, and a cassette revival is underway. Perhaps we’ll see a shellac revival, or even a wax-cylinder revival. The problem is that the accumulated glut of technologies and formats only increases the environmental stress that our demand for maximal musical variety imposes.\n\nAt the end of “Decomposed,” Devine incorporates his ecology of music into a more comprehensive vision of anthropogenic crisis. “Musically, we may need to question our expectations of infinite access and infinite storage,” he writes. Our demand that all of musical history should be available at the touch of a finger has become gluttonous. It may seem a harmless form of consumer desire, but it leaves real scars on the face of the Earth.\n\nDevine holds out hope for a shift in consciousness, similar to the one that has taken place in our relationship with food. When we listen to music, we may ask ourselves: Under what conditions was a particular recording made? How equitable is the process by which it has reached us? Who is being paid? How are they being treated? And—most pressing—how much music do we really need? Perhaps, if we have less of it, it may matter to us more.\n\n[The Hidden Costs of Streaming Music](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/cultural-comment\/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music) #archive",

    "content" : "# Moshi overture iphone 11 Pro max case review | MacSources\n![](Moshi%20overture%20iphone%2011%20Pro%20max%20case%20review%20%7C%20MacSources\/MoshiOvertureFeature-11.42.36-PM.jpg)\nWith so many iPhone cases on the market, it becomes difficult to choose the best option. You can select a simple bumper\/slim case, a fully enclosed armor style case that provides waterproof\/life proofing, magnetic attachment cases, folio\/wallet style cases, or many other styles. Once you have chosen the type of case, you may then gain options to choose among several colors, textures\/styles, etc. With the ever-escalating costs of our smartphones, I remain awestruck that people leave their phones au naturel. For those who may want to enjoy a more basic case, a bumper style\/slim case may be the best for you. For those who want more function, a folio-style wallet case may provide a means to carry your license\/credit cards or cash. The team from moshi took this one step further and combined both into a multifunctional 2-in-1 case, the Overture.\n\nThe Moshi Overture SNAPTO Series case arrived in a 4 1\/4 inches wide by 7 1\/4 inches tall by 1 1\/16 inches thick retail package. The eggshell\/white cover provided the SNAPTO Series title, “Warranty Plus,” and iPhone 11 Pro Max along the top of the cover. The middle of the cover was filled with an eye-catching image of the removable bumper style case and magnetic folio attachment. Beneath the photographic-quality image, you will find three icons, which detailed the military-grade drop protection, wireless charging support, and the 2-1 case + wallet. Just beneath the eggshell panel, you will find a 1 1\/4 inches tall white section. Here, you will find an eggshell square with the Moshi name, and the overture product name, with a detachable wallet. The top panel contained the plastic hanging tab, white the left panel and the bottom slide-out panel remained unadorned. The right panel provided information and links for the [SnapTo series of cases](http:\/\/moshi.com\/snapto), and about the Global 1-Year Warranty and the ability to extend it to a limited lifetime warranty through product registration. The reverse panel proved to be a little busy, providing six bulleted points of information in three languages. The panel listed: Military-grade drop protection MIL-STD-810G\/SGS Certified, Detachable magnetic wallet, Two card slots, and a full-length pocket for cash and receipts, Crafted from premium vegan leather, Raised bezel protects touchscreen when laid flat.” To access the case, simply slip your finger into the lower notch on the rear panel and slide the internal box downward or push downward on the clear hanging tab on the top panel.\n\n![](Moshi%20overture%20iphone%2011%20Pro%20max%20case%20review%20%7C%20MacSources\/MoshiOverturecase-11.42.36-PM.jpg)\nWith the internal box separated from the outer slipcover, I removed the 4.62-ounce black leather case. I was immediately impressed with the tactile feel, the smell of the leather, the equidistant stitching, and the 2 15\/32 silver metallic moshi embellishment along the lower right corner. I opened up the wallet-case and found two card slots along the left and a bumper style case along the right. I lifted upward on the plastic case and was impressed with the strength of the magnetic attachment. With the bumper removed, the leather case measured 7 1\/8 inches wide by 6 3\/4 inches tall and had a 1 1\/2 inches wide by 1 9\/16 inches tall camera cutout. Spanning the 3 1\/16 inches wide by 6 3\/4 inches tall right panel and the 3 inches wide by 6 3\/4 inches tall left panel, you will find a 1-inch wide spine. Hidden beneath the two card slots, you will find a money\/receipt pocket that spans the height of the panel. The internal leather and stitching matched the outer surface of the case, but the inner layer was smoother and had a felt-like feel to it. The inner bumper had 3\/16 by 3\/4 inches cutout for the volume toggle, dual 5\/8 inches wide by 1\/8 inches tall speaker cutouts, a 1\/2 inches wide by 1\/4 inches tall lightning adaptor cutout, and the large 1 1\/8 inches wide by 1 3\/16 inches tall camera cutout. The leathery back surface of the bumper case had a similar appearance to the wallet case. The camera cutout aligned perfectly with the wallet-case cutout and the strong magnets helped to properly align the two pieces. Using a metallic measuring tape, I found four 1\/2 inch by 1\/2 inch magnets embedded in the back of the bumper phone case and the backing of the wallet shell. Looking to the left panel once again, I found the magnets responded to the section between the two card slots and about 1\/2 the distance from the bottom of the panel.\n\n![](Moshi%20overture%20iphone%2011%20Pro%20max%20case%20review%20%7C%20MacSources\/moshiOverture-11.42.36-PM.jpg)\nWithin the bumper case, you will find two 6 1\/8 inches tall by 3 inches wide informative inserts. The first insert was a double-sided cardstock panel showing the magnetic wallet insertion and the placement upon a wireless charger. To charge the device wirelessly, you will first need to remove the bumper case from the wallet and then place it upon your charger. You can add the bumper case to any of the Moshi SnapTo products (Car Mount\/Wall Mount). The second insert provided a three-panel multi-lingual cleaning instruction manual, which recommended soft leather cleansers for the outside and suede cleaner for the inside (do not use bleach\/abrasive solvents\/chemicals). To install your phone, press the right side (volume toggle side) into the case and then walk your fingers around the top\/right side and bottom of the case. The camera, volume toggle, speaker, and lightning port cutouts aligned perfectly. However, my only complaint about this case was with the hard power\/volume buttons. I found that this style of button reduced the accuracy of button presses. Instead of silicone style buttons or plastic inserts, this style of button required harder presses and made it much more difficult to capture screenshots. The wireless charging worked flawlessly and the magnetic attachment to the back of the wallet case remained well affixed. I was impressed with the raised bezel of the case, which added a degree of screen protection. Additionally, I was pleased to find a slightly raised bezel around the camera. Lastly, I wish that there was a latch or stay, to secure the lid of the wallet case when closed.\n\n![](Moshi%20overture%20iphone%2011%20Pro%20max%20case%20review%20%7C%20MacSources\/MoshiOverturecombo-11.42.36-PM.jpg)\nI have enjoyed the moshi overture case over the last two weeks but found it is not congruent with the current COVID-19 environment. I have been cleaning my hands with sanitizer or soap and water regularly and feel that it has been difficult to clean my phone. I have used 70% alcohol sprayed onto a microfiber cloth to wipe down my surfaces, but I am uncertain if that is keeping the leather clean. Additionally, I do not know if that will mess with the inner suede lining. Similar to changing out to shorts during the summer months, I feel that this will be a perfect summer on-the-go case for many people. While working in a hospital, I have preferred a Catalyst Waterproof case because I can wash it with soap and water when I wash my hands. I do not feel this is a negative for the case, however, as it worked well with the SnapTo car mount, wireless charging, and wallet storage of money and a few cards. The volume and power buttons could have been a little more responsive, but overall the bumper case and the wells case worked well for my phone.\n\nLearn more about the [Moshi Overture](https:\/\/www.moshi.com\/en\/product\/overture-for-iphone-11-pro-max\/jet-black).\nFollow moshi on [Facebook](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/moshi.usa\/) and [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/moshi_life). \n\n[Moshi overture iphone 11 Pro max case review](https:\/\/macsources.com\/moshi-overture-iphone-11-pro-max-case-review\/) #archive",

    "content" : "Kilgore Trout on CreateSpace\n\nIn the midst of arranging *Feebles* for print, I stumbled upon an author and \"book designer\" engaged in launching a community for self-published, independent writers. I'm not going to specify names because I have no interest in shitting on his company, nor \"what it stands for.\" I don't want to shit for you at all, actually, just note a few still-underrealized realities about the sheer ludicrousness of the word business as it stands. Let's say you've got some manuscripts you've been sitting on for a few years, and you're introduced to the concept of self-publishing by an evermore earnestly-curious man on the radio named Audie one day. He and his interviewee (the owner of a self-publishing service) seem to say, curiously, that because an author's profit-per-unit can potentially be \"four to five times more\" than if he\/she is published traditionally, self-publishing has now shed completely its aura of desperate amateurism.\n\nBut - whoa, Nelly - writing to sell books, and writing books have perhaps never been further apart. And gee - you certainly didn't write to sell; selling hadn't occurred to you at all for a very long time, but from just one search, you find Our Friend, back from his own experiences as an author and editor, qualified and insistent that you *can* make money selling creative works of fiction.\n\nAnd Jesus Christ... All that said, I must admit to you that I've just finished Kurt Vonnegut's *Breakfast of Champions*, and was unable to commence this \"review\" without wondering aloud for you how Kilgore Trout - perhaps Kurt's favorite creation - would feel about this Friend's business.\n\n#Extratone",

Oh, the [W̘͖̯E̟̹À̫T̯̫͓̪̮͓̼H̝E̪͇̰̘̖͍ͅŔ͍̖̱̟̪](https:\/\/youtu.be\/qg0ZPmSux_4)!! If the past two days on Twitter were any indication, it is indeed time for a year's-end retrospective on what has been published on this Web Site. Given the extent of the attention I've devoted to bilge.world this past year - both technically and editorially - I thought it would be nice to chuck in a bit more in the pursuit of whacking myself on the back. I understand that 2020 has been one helluva catastrophic marker of linear time for just about everyone on Earth - as I write this on its last day, the [inexplicable news of MF Doom's death](https:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2020\/12\/mf-doom-dead-49) has just surfaced and has already hit my adjacent communities remarkably hard.\n\n## Spring\nThe earliest archive.org capture of this particular Writeas blog dates back only to [May 1st of this year](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200501203946\/https:\/\/bilge.world\/), but its stylistic contrast with the site's current version is immense. I believe I was using [Max Henderson's Anxiety theme](https:\/\/write.as\/themes\/anxiety) virtually stock, albeit with some color rearrangements. By the [29th](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200529000327\/https:\/\/bilge.world\/), I had already arrived upon the colors you see today. \"[You Know I'm Blogging](https:\/\/bilge.world\/you-know-im-blogging)\" was just a meta update to say *howdy* after such a long drought, but \"[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)\" actually proved popular (for me) among my newly-connected Fedi crowd, especially, thanks to [an annotated share by Writeas on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/writeas__\/status\/1252704432497836034). Honestly, it was entirely worth it just for the accomplishment of [exposing my platform peer Dino Bansigan to **Alt+D**](https:\/\/journal.dinobansigan.com\/dirty-daves-poweruser-tips-david-blue). Writeas Community Manager CJ Eller and I began corresponding, which led to [an interview](https:\/\/write.as\/community\/chat-with-david-blue) regarding writing tools, managing fiddly compulsions, and the wonder of Markdown.\n\n> I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think – like many people – I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my “to-write” list.  \nI dug deep in my long-overdue todo list for \"[Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review),\" which - along with [my 2018 review of Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review) - I felt was a necessary celebration of digital text as a weapon, which is very dear to me. \"[Preferred Writing Instruments](https:\/\/bilge.world\/preferred-writing-instruments)\" was probably the singular analog departure *The Psalms* will ever see and my condensed commentary on [*Star Trek: Picard*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-picard-review), [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-discovery-review), and [the current state of *Star Trek: Online*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-online) should fulfill all need mention of science fiction, here, for a very long time. Given [yesterday's news regarding Slack's acquisition](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/12\/1\/21719666\/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced), perhaps I should feel revalidated in my insistence that \"[Discord is Better Than Slack](https:\/\/bilge.world\/discord-slack-comparison),\" but a developer friend of mine actually addressed my curiosity regarding why startups never mention Discord as a workplace option, despite its identical functionality: it's all about fuckin' *enterprise security*.\n\nI had wanted to write about [*The Langoliers*](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/film\/the-langoliers\/) - Stephen King's flop of a made-for-TV movie\/extended *Twilight Zone* episode - for a long while. It was probably the first program I watched as a child that genuinely disturbed me and always returns to my thoughts by barren-ish experiences. I had planned to watch the whole three hours all the way through and write whatever came to mind, but I only made it halfway or so in \"[Craig Toomey's Coronavirus](https:\/\/bilge.world\/the-langoliers-stephen-king)\" before I ran completely out of steam. I dropped what I had without revision, to this day. Perhaps one day I shall return...\n\n> In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn.  \nThese two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed novel, [*Blimp's Burden*](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/pith), and are almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simply wouldn't allow them to go forgotten, so I [published the chapter as an excerpt on *The Psalms*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but give it your attention and you'll be amused, I think.\n\n![](The%20Psalms'%202020\/W3crmS2L.png)The Psalms Stats by Post - 2020\n\n## Summer\nThe general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content popularity seems to be something like *you never know what's going to blow up*. I experienced this phenomena quite severely for the first time in my writing life after posting \"[Google Is Not God of The Web](https:\/\/bilge.world\/google-page-experience)\" on [HackerNews](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=23383548) right before going out-of-touch for some 13 straight hours amidst a local BLM protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I expect anything to come of sharing it, there - I only did so simply because the thought crossed my mind. Honestly, it is probably the least-considered content I'd ever published on *The Psalms* - I only put it up when I did because I knew *all* of my energy was about to be absorbed for an entire weekend or more. I only started the thing because I felt it important to raise a small voice in reminder that tech media had started using language when discussing code\/online development which had begun to assume the existence of a single, objective standard of measure for *good web design*. (Fuck your bootstrap baloney, [*The Drywall Website*](https:\/\/iowa.neocities.org\/test) was a *real* *paradigm shit*.)\n\nAnd yet... That single goddamned post would end up accruing more pageviews than all of my writing on the web, combined (I suspect.) Tens of thousands of words were written in hundreds of comments, which I did my best to parse in [a *for the hell of it* substack email](https:\/\/davidblue.substack.com\/p\/witness-google-god-and-local-history):\n\n> Out of everything I’ve shared on *Bilge* recently, it’s hilarious that this particular post - on which I spent a cumulative total of perhaps 25 minutes writing and made less effort than ever to edit - became probably my most widely-shared work of all time.  \nOnce again, I *am* thankful for the readership and correspondence, I just *really fucking wish* it had been on literally *anything* else I've written about technology.\n\nIn retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another vague promise to *re-imagine email* in the days surrounding [the launch of Basecamp's HEY](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/6\/15\/21286466\/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch), but I feel it's important to nurture what paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future, so I decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested visitors to write in with their own thoughts on email. I spent a morning clacking out \"[Email and I: An Abridged History](https:\/\/bilge.world\/hey-email-history),\" which I hope will one day serve as a part-foundation for a thorough, composed extension to my [*Why I Write About Technology*](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e) series. This would be *The Psalms* last relevant work for a few months, while I played around with [an experimental WordPress website](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/wordpress-experimentation\/) and dove into [*fuckin' school*](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/college-return\/) for the first time in seven years.\n\n![](The%20Psalms'%202020\/cwm5gKqi.png)WTF\n\n## Fall\nI returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd discovered: \"[Indulging Once More in Digital Excess](https:\/\/bilge.world\/digital-excess).\" After exploring the concept of [*Digital Gardens*](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/blogchains\/digital-gardens\/), buying [my first pro-ready desktop PC](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/hp-envy-desktop\/) in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe software for the first time, and reading [a delightful book](https:\/\/www.hup.harvard.edu\/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076) documenting the history of word processing, I arrived upon the term *Software Historian* with which to partially describe myself. It doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt be explored imminently on this Web Site.\n\nAddressing \"[The Social Dilemma's Dilemma](https:\/\/bilge.world\/the-social-dilemma)\" and \"[Software Thanksgiving](https:\/\/bilge.world\/big-thank)\" in detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at least note how they represent diametrically opposed perspectives through which to discuss this stuff. Going forward into 2021, I think it's important that I hold short on the progress I've made in moderating my voice since 2018. *Digestibility* is not a virtue I am at all interested in, nor is it an appropriate one in which to invest any more effort. Any non-*radical* argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal, which makes for a huge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all the editorializing I've done.\n\n![](The%20Psalms'%202020\/T4Z1w1nI.jpg)Blogging vs.\n\n## Three Point Oh\nSomewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came across the concept of academic [revision tracking and peer review via Git](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/git-peer-review\/). Having dipped my toe back in academia, any such circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible was naturally intriguing. *Just wait until I show these goons how to use hyperlinks.* Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into the Git-Gone Bender I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actually understand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of nearly 80 repositories on [my new GitHub account](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone). Though I'd created one for each of my web properties ages ago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they were all quickly abandoned. In the past two weeks or so, I think I've actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, best exemplified by [*The Psalms*' Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge) as it stands.\n\nThe \"automated\" [Project Board](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/projects\/1) I set up has so far been a very impressive replacement for the simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their various stages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and actual Publication. Technical \"[Issues](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues)\" regarding the CMS and\/or the Repository, itself, have also fit in these categories well, so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by their number to describe [Commits](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/commits\/main), which form an impressive revision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I also figured out the general idea behind Milestones and set [*The Psalms*' first one](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/milestone\/1) for my 27th birthday, next month. The goal is to have figured this all out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumbling upon entire featuresets multiple times in a workday. [*Thinking in Public*](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/2020\/07\/23\/thinking-in-public\/) - as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say - is what I'm trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are more than welcome to hop the fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you - as it was for me just weeks ago - I would suggest the directory for [In-Progress Drafts](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/Drafts) as a starting point.\n\n[GitHub Actions](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/actions) are still more or less a mystery to me, but I am unbothered - *The Psalms*' seems to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for \"GitHub Universe\" a few weeks ago, when dark mode and GitHub Discussions were opened up to more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single application for forums in the context of my blog's repository, but [I turned them on, anyway](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/discussions). It's very possible that all of the documentation-generating functions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but - as I entrust GitHub with the eternal task of archiving such work - it is my hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.\n\n![](The%20Psalms'%202020\/vMsQQHSG.png)Caslon Bilge Type Capture\n\nIf you've found yourself in possession of a .edu email address and are interested in GitHub related experimentation, see [this list of discounted\/free dev programs\/services for students](https:\/\/education.github.com\/pack\/offers), which includes a free subscription to \"GitHub Pro.\" (Apparently, equivalent to a $4\/month service.)\n\n## Coming Soon\nFor better or worse, all of these new exploratory avenues have so far led directly away from the business of *actually writing*\n\n- - - -\n## GitHub\n\n- [x] [The Project Board](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/projects\/1)\n- [x] [In-Progress Drafts](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/Drafts)\n- [ ] [October 18th, 2018 Capture](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20181101000000*\/bilge.world)\n- [x] The [list of discounted\/free dev programs for students on GitHub](https:\/\/education.github.com\/pack\/offers).\n- [x] [May 1st Capture](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200501203946\/https:\/\/bilge.world\/)\n- [ ] Migrating WTF here, moving the domain to a NeoCities landing page.

    "content" : "what is likely today's most pleasing discovery: a two pack of *tipped* swishers can now be had for a dollar and seven cents at the gas station I can walk to. I think I'm about to quit smoking, or reduce significantly, at least.\n\nanyway, you'd think such a lack of *all* apparent motion would be driving me berserk. perhaps it is. as mom seems to now know most of the time, though, I am always making some sort of progress. my thoughts are never the same. this tattoo... again, it is truth. a truth that is both burden & blessing.\n\nEryn's presence and\/or (perhaps) Brent's absence has allowed me to *so* much better see what surrounds me. that has been one of this summer's major themes. it's been a pause.\n\nI don't think, though, that it's rational to look upon the past fondly, necessarily, or at least in the way we seem to seek. sensation is in the present only. when I thought I was reminiscing on Meagan & I, I could've only been wishing. I am still capable of wishing for her, but it is so very distant now. further and forevermore, it would seem that thought on her will be controlled. it's awfully poetic, but for the first time ever, I actually *forgot* how to play Meagan's song for a good moment. it was surreal: it's always been my favorite melody.\n\nand even after Eryn & I's falling apart (or lapse, perhaps,) her song is a joyful one. I suspect it will always be so.\n\njust since the beginning of June, I've loved that girl more than I've ever loved. I've been more angry with her than I've ever been with anyone. I've been closer to her than I've ever been with anyone. she's hit me so hard that I wonder if I'll ever stop reeling, and that - by all standards of measure, really - is a good thing.\n\nit's been divine, my unraveling. my peacemaking.\n\nthe things from boyhood to which I have so stubbornly clung have been falling away. I am more and more what you'd call *healthy*, every day.\n\nthis clinging has made a good portion of my identity, I think. it's what's made me bitter and funny, so if this process should continue, I'll be different, I'm assuming. I don't regret it, but I am sorry if I cease to provide something for you. I think, though, that what I can provide now more than ever is counsel. this \"seniority\" to which I've been referring is at prime usability, so feel free to ask for advice. I think I'm best at that.\n\n![](what%20is%20likely%20today's%20most%20pleasing%20discovery%20a%20two%20pack%20of%20tipped%20swishers%20can%20now%20be%20had%20for%20a%20dollar%20and%20seven%20cents%20at%20the%20gas%20station%20I%20can%20walk%20to.%20I%20think%20I'm%20about%20to%20quit%20smoking,%20or%20reduce%20significantly,%20at%20least.\/fba614e2e70530790af8ba4d2d58a2f5.jpeg)\n\nas I'm sure you know, I've been writing a lot. *Feebles* seems very far behind, though it's only been since March. I've just received 20 copies of the most perfect revision (as far as I know, it was only a single character away from \"spotlessness.\") I plan to sell & sign them in front of Columbia's Yellow Dog Bookshop before the summer's up.\n\nThe vast majority of what I've written recently has been reflectory, but I did place a (http:\/\/extratone.com\/inred\/averagedapparitions) preview of *Averaged Apparitions* on *Extratone*. It's a bit manifesto-esque, but it's the most recent sample of my publish-bound work available. rather abruptly, I seem to have found my \"voice.\" it's definitely clearer. have you noticed?\n\nas to *Extratone* itself, I hope you know that - while it is significant in encompassing everything - I continue it mostly because *I can*. there's no need to pity me for its lack of \"success.\" it's ridiculously easy to maintain such a thing these days, so a good bit of my case for it is *why not*. I will continue putting time & effort into it because 1) it is good practice for any personally-suitable future career and 2) I still have a fairly-original mission & standard for which I do enjoy slaving away.\n\nmy time with Eryn has agitated an already present, semi-dormant itch for the educational ideal. aspiring to teach at some point has been making more and more sense. I've always enjoyed mentorship, so the pursuit of qualification has been on my mind.\n\nI've been more emotional this summer than I've ever been in life, so I've been doing my best to let an appropriate amount of it seep into my public discourse. if you're interested in helping me, it seems I've entered a bit of a rut with this piece on the future of memory. you're all intelligent folk; if it inspires thought, please do not hesitate to share.\n\nalso remember that if you're reading this, I love you and will always be glad to hear from you in any capacity. I don't know if this kind of thing will be regular, or ever occur again, but I shall certainly remain infinitely-accessible, should you want or need me.\n\nlove,\n\nΔaviδ Blue\n\n#legacy",

I remember freaking the fuck out about IFTTT when it first came out in 2011 - no doubt an influential predecessor as the service that gave end users the abstracts “recipes” and “tasks.”\n※ David Blue ※ (‪@NeoYokel‬)\n3\/7\/21, 14:28\nan idea of mine which I still consider to be genius: it seemed like a revelation when it occured to me to take the “secret” email-to-post address of the Drywall Tumblr and sign it up for a bunch of couponing newsletters. drywallmusic.tumblr.com\n※ David Blue ※ (‪@NeoYokel‬)\n3\/7\/21, 14:31\nat the time, it felt rebellious and smart. looking back on it in 2021, it looks awfully familiar. I guess a whole lot of bot enthusiasts were thinking similarly. definitely art, though.\n※ David Blue ※ (‪@NeoYokel‬)\n3\/7\/21, 14:33\nI am SUCH a product of the internet. maybe I should try to write my own Trick Mirror like Jia Tolentino, but about Drywall lol.\n\n\nDavid Blue\nEditor-in-Chief,\nExtratone\n\n[OPEN IN SPARK](readdle-spark:\/\/bl=QTppaGFkdG9wZWVAZ21haWwuY29tO0lEOjI2OUM0NjYxLTYyRUEtNDI4Qy1CNUM1%0D%0ALUVFMEQzRTg2MUFBMUBpY2xvdWQuY29tO2dJRDoxNjkzNjA2OTI1NTc3MDczMTU0%0D%0AOzIzOTI5MDAxMg%3D%3D)\n\n#i #legacy \nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/shortcuts\/comments\/m4rob3\/using_shortcuts_to_protect_from_outside_intrusion\/\n[It’s not just you, sharing shortcuts via iCloud is completely broken right now - 9to5Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2021\/03\/24\/icloud-shortcut-sharing-broken\/)",

    "content" : "# Everything New in the iOS 14.5 Beta | MacRumors\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/14.5-on-iPhone-12-feature.jpg)\nApple today [seeded the first betas](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/02\/01\/apple-releases-ios-14-5-beta-1-to-developers\/) of upcoming iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 updates, and while the new software serves as a deadline for when app developers [must comply](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/28\/app-tracking-transparency-required-soon\/) with App Tracking Transparency rules, there are also a handful of other changes worth noting.\n\n## Apple Watch iPhone Unlocking\nWith iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4, Apple is making it easier to [unlock an iPhone](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/02\/01\/ios-14-5-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch\/) when you're wearing a mask. There's a new \"Unlock with Apple Watch\" feature that allows the [iPhone](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/iphone\/) to use an unlocked and authenticated Apple Watch as a secondary authentication method.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/iphone-apple-watch-unlock-2.jpg)\n\nThat means you do not have to take off your mask or enter a passcode to unlock your ‌iPhone‌ when this feature is enabled. It requires both an ‌iPhone‌ running iOS 14.5 and an Apple Watch running watchOS 7.4 and it must be enabled in the Settings app by going to Face ID & Passcode and toggling on \"Unlock with Apple Watch.\"\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/iphone-apple-watch-unlock.jpg)\n\nAn unlocked Apple Watch can be paired with Face ID to unlock your ‌iPhone‌ without having to enter a passcode, but it cannot be used to authenticate [Apple Pay](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/apple-pay\/) or [App Store](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/app-store\/) purchases. These will still require the full Face ID facial scan or a passcode.\n\n## Dual-SIM 5G Support\nThose who use the ‌iPhone‌'s Dual-SIM functionality will be happy to hear that iOS 14.5 finally introduces [global support for 5G](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/02\/01\/ios-14-5-enables-5g-in-dual-sim-mode\/) in Dual-SIM mode on the [iPhone 12](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-12\/) models.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/iPhone-12-5G-Dual-Carrier-Feature-orange.jpg)\n\nThe Dual-SIM feature on the ‌iPhone 12‌ allows for two lines of service on a single ‌iPhone‌, useful for traveling or keeping separate work and home numbers. Prior to iOS 14.5, Dual-SIM mode was limited to LTE in all countries except for China, but iOS 14.5 will allow Dual-SIM users to get 5G speeds on both lines.\n\n## T-Mobile Standalone 5G Network Support\nAccording to [Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tmobile\/comments\/lab6xm\/latest_ios_beta_145_activates_tmo_nr_sa\/), iOS 14.5 also introduces support for T-Mobile's [standalone 5G network](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2020\/08\/04\/t-mobile-5g-standalone-network\/). Standalone 5G support allows a direct connection to a 5G network without the need for piggybacking on an LTE network, which allows for better 5G range and lower latency in some situations.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/t-mobile-5g-standalone-support.jpg)\n## AirPlay 2 for Fitness+\niOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and watchOS 7.4 [enable AirPlay 2 support](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/02\/01\/apple-fitness-plus-airplay-2-support\/) for Apple Fitness+, allowing Apple Fitness+ subscribers to [AirPlay](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/airplay\/) their workouts to a compatible ‌AirPlay‌ 2-enabled smart TV or set-top box.\n\nWorkouts can be displayed on a bigger screen with this feature, but unfortunately, Apple Watch metrics are not able to be displayed on the TV when AirPlaying a workout from an ‌iPhone‌ or [iPad](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/ipad\/). Activity rings, workout time remaining, calories, burned, set length, and burn bars will not show up on the TV set and will instead need to be viewed on the connected ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.\n\n## Expanded Controller Support\nWith iOS and iPadOS 14.5, you [can now use](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/02\/01\/ios-14-5-xbox-ps5-controller-support\/) the latest PlayStation 5 DualSense and Xbox Series X controllers with the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌iPad‌. It's also likely that the [Apple TV](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/apple-tv\/) supports the new controllers with the tvOS 14.5 update.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/play-station-dualsense-controller.jpeg)\n\n## Apple Card Family Support\nCode [in the iOS 14.5 update](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/02\/01\/apple-card-multi-user-support-ios-14-5\/) indicates that Apple will add a new feature that will allow for multiple people to use the same [Apple Card](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/apple-card\/) account, which will let family members share a single card.\n\nThe main ‌Apple Card‌ account holder will be able to invite family members to use the ‌Apple Card‌ account, with family spending available for viewing in the Wallet app. Account holders will be able to set spending limits so all family members, including children, can use the card.\n\nThough the code is in the update, the ‌Apple Card‌ family sharing feature does not appear to be live for ‌Apple Card‌ holders as of yet.\n\n## Siri Emergency Calls\nAccording to [Rene Ritchie](https:\/\/twitter.com\/reneritchie\/status\/1356309325820665857), iOS 14.5 has a feature that ::allows [Siri](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/siri\/) to call emergency services with a \"Hey ‌Siri‌, call emergency\" command::. This appears to also work in earlier versions of iOS, so it may be a server-side change.\n\n## App Tracking Transparency\nWhen iOS 14.5 is released, developers will need to ask for and receive a user's permission to access their random advertising identifier, which is used to track activity across apps and websites.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/app-tracking-settings-ios-14.jpg)\n\nYou're probably already familiar with these upcoming changes because Facebook has been [making a big stink](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2020\/12\/16\/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple\/) about them, but with this beta, you should see more apps start to comply with Apple's rules, presenting a popup that lets you agree to or disable ad tracking.\n\nApple has already implemented all of the framework for App Tracking Transparency, so these popups are also going to appear more frequently in earlier versions of [iOS 14](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/ios-14\/). iOS 14.5 is more of a deadline than a feature update when it comes to Apple's new privacy rules, but it will mark the wide adoption of Apple's ‌iOS 14‌ anti-tracking functionality.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/app-tracking-transparency-prompt-ios-14.jpg)\n\nOne notable aspect of this change is a requirement that developers not track you in *other ways* to skirt the preferences that you select for anti-tracking, so if you choose not to allow an app to track you with a random advertising identifier, that app is not allowed to use non-Apple sanctioned tools to get around the rules.\n\n## Podcasts App\nThere are some minor design changes that were made to the Podcasts app. Podcasts under \"Shows\" are now more prominently listed with episode descriptions and an easier access \"Resume\" button. The Search tab also allows you to browse through different categories to find what you're looking for.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/podcast-app-design-changes.jpg)\n\n## Reminders App\nThere's now an option to sort lists in Reminders by Due Date, Creation Date, Priority, or Title, plus there is an option to print a Reminder list, which has been a feature that Reminders users have wanted for some time.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/reminders-app-sort-print.jpg)\n\n## News App\nThere's a new Search tab in the [Apple News](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/apple-news-plus\/) app, and the News+ section has been redesigned with a \"For You\" feature and an easier to access Browse tab. \n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/apple-news-plus-changes.jpg)\n\n## Emergency Alerts Settings\nIf you go to Settings > Notifications and scroll all the way down to Emergency Alerts, ::you can now tap the setting to disable an \"Always Deliver\" feature that causes emergency alerts to not play a sound when the Volume\/Ringer is silenced::. Alerts for earthquakes, tsunamis, and other similar emergency alerts will still cause your ‌iPhone‌ to sound an alarm, according to Apple's code.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/emergency-alerts-options.jpg)\n\n## Horizontal Loading Screen\nOn the ‌iPad‌, the loading screen with the Apple logo now shows up in a horizontal orientation if your ‌iPad‌ is positioned that way.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/ipad-horizontal-boot-up.jpg)\n## Emoji Search\nYou can now search for a specific emoji in iPadOS 14.5, a feature that was added to the ‌iPhone‌ with the launch of ‌iOS 14‌.\n\n![](Everything%20New%20in%20the%20iOS%2014.5%20Beta%20%7C%20MacRumors\/emoji-search-ipados-14-5.jpg)\n\n## Smaller Features\nThere are also quite a few smaller features that have been added in the iOS 14.5 update, which are listed below.\n\n* Interfaces for typing to ‌Siri‌ and sending iMessages with ‌Siri‌ have received some minor design tweaks to use Apple's more compact UI.\n* There are minor design changes when asking ‌Siri‌ to locate a person using the [Find My](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/find-my\/) app.\n* There are new sounds for locating Beats in the ‌Find My‌ app.\n* There are some updates to the Hermes watch faces with new color additions.\n* There are new colors for Beats icons.\n* It should now be easier to set up an ‌iPad‌ with a cellular connection.\n* German Girocards may now be able to be added to the Wallet app to be used with ‌Apple Pay‌.\n* When your Apple Watch is up to date, there's a new message: \"Your Apple Watch is up to date with all the latest bug fixes and security enhancements.\"\n* When your ‌iPhone‌ is up to date, there's a new message: \"Your ‌iPhone‌ is up to date with all the latest bug fixes and security enhancements.\"\n\n## Code Changes\nThere are also a handful of changes to the underlying code that don't necessarily reflect new feature implementations at this time, but could potentially serve as an indication of what's coming in the future.\n\n* ‌Siri‌ may be able to tell you about traffic conditions when in the car.\n* There are hints of new ‌Siri‌ car commands that could be implemented in the future.\n* There are mentions of U1 chip pairing for the car, which is perhaps related to some automobile manufacturers' plans to implement Ultra Wideband support for digital keys. BMW [announced](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/13\/bmw-digital-key-plus-ultra-wideband\/) a \"Digital Key Plus\" feature that uses Ultra Wideband in January.\n* ::There are \"Edutainment\" plugin mentions.::\n* iOS 14.5 has mentions in the code of financial health features that could perhaps analyze your spending to provide recommendations on improving your finances. It appears the feature may also help you plan out purchases and payment schedules for financed items.\n* There are SensorKit UI Facial metrics and speech metrics that appear to be related to health studies. These features allow the ‌iPhone‌ to detect facial expressions and listen for laughing, shouting, and other emotion-related metrics.\n* We may see new Shazam integrations, with Apple adding a new background Shazam process.\n* ‌Siri‌ may be able to modify Contact entries in the future.\n* There are some new wallpaper mentions, but no outward-facing wallpaper changes.\n* There are new diagnostic sounds, possibly related to [AirPods Pro](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/airpods-pro\/) repair and testing.\n\n[Everything New in the iOS 14.5 Beta](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/everything-new-in-ios-14-5-beta\/) | *MacRumors*\n\n#archive #i #documentation",

    "content" : "# Major changes coming to Clyp\nBack in 2014, Clyp started out as a simple platform to upload audio files - kind of like the Imgur of audio. Then slowly over the years, thanks in part to feedback from many of you, we added more features and worked to create the best place for creators to share audio on the web.\n\nAt the same time, we also realized we had to make some money in order to keep the lights on. Turns out hosting millions of audio files is pretty expensive. So we ended up adding premium features like lossless WAV streaming, custom playback widgets, unlimited uploads, and much more. While this helped some, it wasn’t quite enough.\n\nIn true 2020 fashion, we will be making some major (and likely quite unpopular) changes to the platform. This was a very tough decision, but we realized it is absolutely necessary for the long-term survival of Clyp.\n\n## **Effective December 5, 2020 Clyp will be moving to a fully paid platform.**\nWhat this means is that after December 5, 2020 we are removing the ability to upload new Clyps to free accounts. The current free tier, known as Basic, will become $3\/month or $24\/year. We will be offering a discount through the end of 2020 where current free users can upgrade to Basic for only $18\/year for the first year (subsequent renewals will be billed at full price). Plus and Pro will remain unchanged.\n\nIf you currently have a free account, you will still be able to login and listen to anything you’ve uploaded, leave comments, and download your Clyps - the only thing you will not be able to do anymore is upload new content.\n\nWe know this is a big change, but if you can, we hope you’ll continue to support us. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks,\nThe Clyp Team\n\n[Major changes coming to Clyp](https:\/\/clypblog.tumblr.com\/post\/636222649313394688\/major-changes-coming-to-clyp) #archive",

    "content" : "-He was most proud to think of himself as fatherless, but found zeal to be a poorer and poorer substitute for wisdom as his few years had passed. He feared nothing more than this secret's release\n\n-Both proverbs. One habitual release, the other recited prayers of guidance.\n\nBoth of them were woven inexplicably; mystically with the sultry voice of the old German baby grand that hadn't left the notch in the choir bannister of the Lutheran church's new building since it'd been erected in 1953. Of the connections they'd been discovering in fecundity between them - almost feverishly - that season, their mutual powerlessness to a chordophone's resonance was perhaps the most primal. Not sexually primal, necessarily - sharing an attenuation to witness such a particular sort of event is not aphrodisiacal, per se, but *was* of such a gargantuan intimacy that it couldn't be fully realized, in the moment.\n\nThe keys performed vastly different functions for the two, respectively.\n\n#Pith"

For those unaware, [Microsoft is apparently talking with Discord about possibly buying them up](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/microsoft-is-in-exclusive-talks-to-acquire-discord-11616715164) for at least $10 billion. As I'm writing this, it hasn't happened yet which is always the most fun time to speculate.\n\nBefore this whole deal was being considered, I had intended to write a bit about the idea of why business don't, or can't, use Discord. That isn't to suggest it's a business platform but a sentiment that pops up sometimes from employees is \"Why can't we use Discord at work?\". This seems like as good an excuse as any to dig a little into why Discord and Slack are different but also, what if they weren't anymore.\n\nAs far as my credentials, I'm just simply a user of Slack and Discord. I've used the former in a work setting but also talked with some Internal IT and Security Risk people about the latter one time or another. None of this should be taken as some sort of analysis (financial or otherwise) because most of this is just me brain dumping some thoughts after going for a walk. I'm sitting down at my computer and I don't want to put in more effort than I need to!\n\nWith that out of the way, let's talk a bit about Discord.\n\n## Isn't Discord for gamers?\n\nFor those who haven't used Discord or even heard of it, it's a \"communications\" app that was initially focused at \"gamers\" but has expanded to cater to all sorts of communities. This pivot seemed to be a sort of \"build it and they will come\" in overdrive but also aided by the pain of using Slack at the time.\n\nSlack has come a long way but from memory, back around the mid-2010s, it was painful being a large community using Slack. Inviting people was hard enough because you had to send them an email invite. This didn't really scale so people would make these pseudo-self service websites where you would enter your email and then someone would get back to you, or something like that.\n\nThe other, more relevant issue was the hidden user limit on the free tiers. For open source communities and the like, they quickly found that their workspaces would [max out at around 5000+ users](https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it-391bcc714c81\/) making the app barely usuable. Some groups \"fixed\" this by having overflow workspaces (ie <project-name>-2) and so on while others migrated to other platforms, with Discord being one of them.\n\nThis is all anecdotal of course but between the ability to self invite yourself to Discord servers and the ability to support tens of thousands of users, it seemed to be more viable than Slack, for non-paying users, back then anyway. Slack does scale to much, much higher numbers for paying users, and their [enterprise plan](https:\/\/slack.com\/intl\/en-nz\/enterprise) allows you to effectively pseudo-\"partition\" your business into multiple workspaces. I say pseudo because some channels may span across multiple spaces while others only exist within one workspace but that's besides the point.\n\n## What keeps people using yet another chat platform?\n\nWhile I can't speak to the actual wider audience, I can at least point out a few things that I think are done well in Discord, compared to what else is available.\n\n### Technical competency\n\nI don't actually have any evidence of this but Discord seems like an application that has been fairly well developed.\n\nThe desktop clients built using [electron](https:\/\/www.electronjs.org) which has a tendency to be [resource intensive](https:\/\/josephg.com\/blog\/electron-is-flash-for-the-desktop\/) among other things but Discord is generally considered to be one of \"the good ones\".\n\nThis is where we leave evidence for anecdote territory but I'd be hard pressed to recall a time where Discord has been sluggish or broken due to some obscure dependency issue. There are still [outages](https:\/\/discordstatus.com), as with any [SaaS](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Software_as_a_service) product but by and large, the \"feel\" of the application has remained snappy.\n\nSome of the technical skill on display can arguably be demonstrated through Discord's [engineering blog](https:\/\/blog.discord.com\/engineering-posts\/home), featuring some deep dives into [reducing latency](https:\/\/blog.discord.com\/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3), and their seemingly investment in contributing [open source software](https:\/\/github.com\/discord) to the community.\n\nTake all this with a grain of salt mind you since a comparison to Slack would be comparing apples to oranges. In my mind, enterprises and Microsoft both lean towards having a swiss army knife that does everything for everyone where Discord doesn't have to bend over backwards to implement features that don't make sense... yet? As such, I can imagine they might have less bloating than something like Microsoft Teams would, which doesn't hurt when having to scale up.\n\n## Discord as a meta-layer\n\nTo some extent, Discord can be [thought of as a meta-layer](https:\/\/kwokchain.com\/2019\/08\/16\/the-arc-of-collaboration\/). That's just a fancy way of saying that when you're in a game, you don't necessarily \"leave\" Discord because there is an overlay that appears within the game.\n\n[![A mock screenshot from the original Discord support pages. It shows a game, possibly Fortnite, in the background obscured by two large windows. The window on the left shows some channels within a Discord server. The window on the right shows the contents of the selected channel, called #pallet-town.](discord-overlay.jpg)](discord-overlay.jpg)\n\nIf you hit whatever the key combination is, the game UI dims as a Discord window pops up and you can chat with your friends. Whether it's text or voice chat, you don't have to leave the game to interact with Discord as a whole.\n\nThis concept isn't new by the way. Valve[^valve] have offered an overlay for titles distributed via [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/about\/) for many years. The difference with Discord is that they have remained relatively platform agnostic. Whether it's [Origin](https:\/\/origin.com), [Ubisoft Connect](https:\/\/ubisoftconnect.com\/en-US\/)[^uplay] or even [Xbox](https:\/\/news.xbox.com\/en-us\/2018\/04\/24\/microsoft-discord-team-connect-gamers-across-xbox-live-discord\/), odds are the Discord overlay will work out of the box.\n\nThis idea of a \"meta-layer\" isn't strictly related to just gaming. If you view the profile for someone on your friends list, you might see that their presence spans beyond just gaming.[^profiles]\n\n[![A screenshot showing the Discord client. It's a regular macOS window with extremely dim, unreadable text in the background with a green modal in the forefront. It shows the authors Discord profile name at the top. In the middle is a block that reads \"Listening to Spotify\". It depicts the author is currently listening to the song \"Imbrium - 0edit Remix\" by \"Ed Harrison\" on Spotify. The user is provided a link to listen along with the author, adding to the idea of Discord being a meta-layer between users and a music streaming service in this case. At the bottom is a two column grid showing a variety of links to profiles such as Battle.NET, Github, Spotify and Steam.](profiles.png)](profiles.png)\n\nWhile initially focused on gaming, Discord has some integrations with more widely used platforms such as Spotify and Github. For Spotify, you can see what friends are listening to, and even listen alongside them. For Github, it's merely just a vanity thing but as a reminder, Microsoft does own Github now. Just something to keep in mind.\n\nNow having an overlay in itself isn't valuable of course but it's a taste of what makes Discord feel lively. A sort of glimpse into what other people are doing beyond relying on someone updating a status message. Some users have taken this idea of Discord's [rich presence](https:\/\/discord.com\/rich-presence) and expanded it into desktop applications such as [text editors](https:\/\/github.com\/LeonardSSH\/coc-discord-rpc), [image editors](https:\/\/github.com\/smokes\/photoshop-rich-presence) and even [websites](https:\/\/github.com\/imfunniee\/youtube-discord-rpc).\n\n## So why don't businesses use Discord?\n\nI can only speak from the point of view of the discussions that I referenced earlier but from a business point of view, there's a few things I can at least theorise.\n\nThe most obvious point is simply the target market for Discord. They don't market themselves as a business application. I don't doubt there are companies who use Discord, and employees who wish they could use Discord but as it stands, they aren't aimed at business.\n\nI can only imagine someone trying to pitch \"gamer chat\" to an executive board before the rebrand went ahead. Not exactly a good look but for the sake of argument, let's say that were aimed at business.\n\nThere are a few things missing such as user management tools, security certifications and probably single sign on. Let's look at those one by one.\n\n### Security certifications\n\nArguably the most important, and generally the real answer to \"Why can't we use Discord at work\".\n\nFor the unfamiliar, there are generally two standards to keep an eye out for when it comes to determining the \"security posture\" of a business: [ISO 27001](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ISO\/IEC_27001) and [SOC 2](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/System_and_Organization_Controls#Types).\n\nIf you're familiar, feel free to skip this part otherwise I'll try to keep this as straight forward as jargon free as I can. You should also note that I don't work in the realm of security analysis. I don't have a good understanding of these two standards in depth so this is just what I've picked up from people who do.\n\nThe purpose of ISO 27001 is essentially to outline how businesses should go about recognising, and reducing risk. What does this even mean? Let's pretend we work at Discord.\n\nYou're sitting in your office and there's someone at the front door knocking on the door, wanting to be let in. Is that a risk? Well, it depends if they're an employee or not. Businesses can be a pretty big place so you're not guaranteed to know everyone. The risk here would be if you let someone \"unauthorised\" (ie not an employee) into the building, without your knowledge. They could do all sorts of things like look at confidential documents or planting malware on a computer. It's not to say that they would of course but it's still a possible risk.\n\nNow you might assume that a security standard would say \"Well, all employees should wear badges\" but that's not quite correct. Generally, it would say something like \"You should be able to identify who is allowed to enter the building\". The next step might be to answer this by \"Well, we'll have everyone wear badges\" but it isn't prescriptive. The idea is that you can identify any given risk (unauthorised people entering the office) and reduce the likelihood of that risk happening (making it clear who is an employee with a badge).\n\nBringing it back to Slack, they have both [ISO 27001](https:\/\/a.slack-edge.com\/5ff60\/marketing\/downloads\/security\/Slack-27001-1105886-4.pdf) and SOC 2[^slack-soc2] certification where as Discord does not.\n\nFor a large business looking to decide between Slack and Discord, seeing the magic words \"ISO 27001 and SOC 2\" is like instant shorthand for \"Ah, they will handle our data securely\". This isn't to say that Discord is not secure by any means but just that Slack has been audited to prove it.\n\nYou don't have to ask \"Do Slack employees wear badges to keep unauthorised people out\" for example because the certifications prove as such. When evaluating Discord, your security people are probably going to have a laundry list of questions that they'll want answered and proven.\n\nIn reality, Discord would likely not even be considered due to lack of credentials before it even comes to evaluating whether they'd be a good fit.\n\n### User management\n\nNext up, let's look at a small business using Discord to chat.\n\nGetting onto Discord is easy. You just sign up and join your private server. If your coworker is having trouble, you can just simply walk over and help them. When the next person joins, someone sits with them and installs Discord or they do it themselves.\n\nThat all works fine but now you've got hundreds or thousands of users. Installing Discord on their laptops might be easy enough (some software installs it automatically) but how do you set up accounts?\n\nDo you get them to manually make them? Well, you could but some are probably going to run into trouble and it'd be easier if an account could just be made for them. Generally, businesses will have one single way to sign in, such as [Okta](https:\/\/www.okta.com) or a work-only [Google account](https:\/\/saml-doc.okta.com\/SAML_Docs\/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-Slack.html).\n\nAlong with this generally comes a permissions model such as \"Users in this group are administrators while users in this other group can do X and Y but not Z\". These permissions carry into Slack, and are inherited by Slack user accounts, but they're inherited from some single source of truth. Often times, this tends to be [Active Directory](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Active_Directory) which you can basically think of like a big phone book but that's outside of the scope of this post.\n\nNow for Discord, to my knowledge, there is no such way to sign in using some external account. You can use Discord to sign in to things but you can sign into Discord itself using outside accounts. This also means you can't automatically set some users to have more permissions than others.\n\n\n\n### What if you had Discord Rich Presence at work?\n\nAs our first dip in the waters of \"What if\", it doesn't take much to imagine a private Discord server with your fellow coworkers and being able to see what they're up to. Coworker A is editing \"New User Profile Redesign\" with [Figma](https:\/\/www.figma.com) while Coworker B is editing \"2021 DMCA Notice\" in Microsoft Word. From a purely technical standpoint, it's a cool idea but the social and security implications make it a living nightmare.\n\nTechnically, the ability to pop open an overlay in your text editor without having to alt tab to another window would be interesting. It's still context switching but no matter where you are, you don't have to switch out of the application you're in necessarily. Your overlay may be scoped to just one channel while the rest of your notifications can be ignored for later.\n\nSocially, the idea that anyone could watch what you're up to during the day is at best uncomfortable and at worst compromising. I imagine you could turn these of course but taken to the logic extreme, you just know some micro manager would insist that rich presence is made available to all possible applications and forced on by default.\n\nSecurity wise, you'd definitely want to make these accounts separate from your user account.\n\n[^profiles]: There's no reward for doing this but it helps bind together otherwise disconnected profiles. Some friends I have online tend to change username from time to time or use different names for each platform. One thing I often have trouble with is remembering the Twitter username for someone I know on Steam for example.\n\n[^valve]: Valve is the name of the game development company who distributes Steam. Often times, Valve are mistaken referred to as Steam or it's believed that Steam is a company unto itself. The reality is that Steam was created to distribute Valve games via the internet but has now been the largest digital PC gaming store for quite some time now.\n\n[^uplay]: For those who were vaguely familiar with uPlay, apparently Ubisoft rebranded uPlay to Ubisoft Connect sometime in 2020. News to me!\n\n[^slack-soc2]: Like a lot of companies, SOC 2 reports tend to be available upon request for enterprise companies but otherwise are not made public. Presumably because they contain confidential information but I've never read one personally.\n"

Like replac­ing stan­dard bul­lets in our [week­ly newslet­ter](http:\/\/bit.ly\/thetonearchive) with ◎ (U+25CE,) — prob­a­bly my all-time favorite, or using strings of four char­ac­ters for intro, ad, and sta­tion iden­ti­fi­ca­tion spots on [Extra­tone Radio](http:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone). (☉☉☉☉, for instance.) I’d like to think these uses make their expe­ri­ences feel just a bit more unique to users — if only uncon­scious­ly — but I’d long won­dered if I was in fact the last Uni­code enthu­si­ast alive.\n\nThe devel­op­ment of [Jor­dan Hipwell’s UniChar for iOS](https:\/\/apple.co\/2twLdBA) would sug­gest oth­er­wise. Its app store page describes it as “a pow­er­ful yet beau­ti­ful Uni­code sym­bol selec­tion app and key­board,” and its [gener­ic web­page](https:\/\/unichar.app) appears to have *tes­ti­mo­ni­als* includ­ing a *[real post](https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/this-ios-keyboard-app-will-give-you-all-the-unicode-cha-1822994495)* on the Web Site *life­hack­er.*\n\n> UniChar is a third-par­ty iOS key­board that unlocks the wide wide world of weird Uni­code char­ac­ters. Ser­vice marks, copy­right logos, math­e­mat­i­cal sym­bols, tech­ni­cal signs like Apple’s “splat” icon or radioac­tiv­i­ty indi­ca­tors, and more are avail­able in the stand­alone app as well as the key­board add-on you can use wher­ev­er you need to type some­thing.  \n\nWow! I can’t believe I’d pull-quote *life­hack­er* any­where, but here is an iOS app that *actu­al­ly address­es* a reg­u­lar issue of my own in a beau­ti­ful and intu­itive way. I actu­al­ly can­not remem­ber the last time this hap­pened — you’d have to give me a list and a com­pre­hen­sive refresh­er of all the ways I’ve used my iPhones in the past ten years.\n\nCon­trary to what may seem obvi­ous, UniChar’s char­ac­ter selec­tor is by far the more intu­itive and effi­cient of these two sep­a­rate ways to use it. Even in the free expe­ri­ence, there are sim­ply *too many* *char­ac­ters* in the cat­a­log to rea­son­ably browse in iOS’ old extend­ed key­board. (For the record, I’d like to note that UniChar is tech­ni­cal­ly a “Ref­er­ence Appli­ca­tion,” but I under­stand if you can’t bring your­self to use the term.) Across both the seam­less­ly-inter­change­able gallery and list views, the user can very quick­ly copy a char­ac­ter to the clip­board with 3D Touch, which works so well it’s as if it were meant only for this use from its begin­ning.\n\nIn the off chance you’re a long­time lover and devout user of the grander Uni­code col­lec­tion and an iOS user, I hope you’re now expe­ri­enc­ing the same sort of pet­ty enthu­si­asm I felt myself when I dis­cov­ered it. If not, I hope you’ll take away a desire to explore it. I mean… aren’t these smi­leys way bet­ter than any emo­ji? ☺☺☺☺\n\nDespite a hand­ful of reports of crash­ing issues in App Store reviews, Unichar has con­tin­ued to per­form admirably for me. I end­ed up spend­ing $2.99 to unlock the full Unichar­ac­ter key­board as the tremen­dous val­ue of that num­ber for the time and effort it would save myself would be more than worth it. (Actu­al­ly, it’s thanks to Red­bub­ble for send­ing me the first tru­ly usable Inter net Mon­ey I’ve had to actu­al­ly *spend* on any apps and\/or ser­vices in fuck­ing for­ev­er, but you know.) After all this time, I’m still gid­dy that [some­one else on Earth](https:\/\/jordanhipwell.com\/) val­ues these hiero­glyphs as much as I do, and that they knew enough to man­i­fest the per­fect soft­ware to pre­serve them.\n\n[#software](http:\/\/bilge.world\/tag:software)\n\n[⨃🄝ɨ∁ɧ⍙℟ for iOS Review — The Psalms](http:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review)\n#archive #i",

    "content" : "# Capturing Stereo Audio from Built-In Microphones\nConfigure an iOS device’s built-in microphones to add stereo recording capabilities to your app.\n\n## Overview\nStereo audio uses two channels to create the illusion of multidirectional sound, adding greater depth and dimension to your audio and resulting in an immersive listening experience. iOS provides a number of ways to record audio from the built-in microphones, but until now it's been limited to mono audio only. Starting in iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, you can now capture stereo audio using the built-in microphones on supported devices.\n\nBecause a user can hold an iOS device in a variety of ways, you need to specify the orientation of the right and left channels in the stereo field. Set the built-in microphone’s directionality by configuring:\n* Polar pattern. The system represents the individual device microphones, and beamformers that use multiple microphones, as data sources. Select the front or back data source and set its polar pattern to stereo.\n* Input orientation. When recording video, set the input orientation to match the video orientation. When recording audio only, set the input orientation to match the user interface orientation. In both cases, don’t change the orientation during recording.\n\nThis sample app shows how to configure your app to record stereo audio, and helps you visualize changes to the input orientation and data-source selection.\n\n* Note: You must run the sample on a supported physical device running iOS 14, or later. To determine whether a device supports stereo recording, query the audio session’s selected data source to see if its [supportedPolarPatterns](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/avfoundation\/avaudiosessiondatasourcedescription\/1616450-supportedpolarpatterns) array contains the [stereo](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/avfoundation\/avaudiosession\/polarpattern\/3551726-stereo) polar pattern.\n\n## Configure the Audio Session Category\nRecording stereo audio requires the app’s audio session to use either the [record](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/avfoundation\/avaudiosession\/category\/1616451-record) or [playAndRecord](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/avfoundation\/avaudiosession\/category\/1616568-playandrecord) category. The sample uses the `playAndRecord` category so it can do both. It also passes the `defaultToSpeaker` and `allowBluetooth` options to route the audio to the speaker instead of the receiver, and to Bluetooth headphones.\n\n```swift\nfunc setupAudioSession() {\n    do {\n        let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()\n        try session.setCategory(.playAndRecord, options: [.defaultToSpeaker, .allowBluetooth])\n        try session.setActive(true)\n    } catch {\n        fatalError(\"Failed to configure and activate session.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n[View in Source](x-source-tag:\/\/SetupAudioSession)\n\n## Select and Configure a Built-In Microphone\nAn iOS device’s built-in microphone input consists of an array of physical microphones and beamformers, each represented as an instance of `AVAudioSessionDataSourceDescription`. The sample app finds the built-in microphone input by querying the available inputs for the one where the port type equals the built-in microphone, and sets it as the preferred input.\n\n```swift\nprivate func enableBuiltInMic() {\n    \/\/ Get the shared audio session.\n    let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()\n    \n    \/\/ Find the built-in microphone input.\n    guard let availableInputs = session.availableInputs,\n          let builtInMicInput = availableInputs.first(where: { $0.portType == .builtInMic }) else {\n        print(\"The device must have a built-in microphone.\")\n        return\n    }\n    \n    \/\/ Make the built-in microphone input the preferred input.\n    do {\n        try session.setPreferredInput(builtInMicInput)\n    } catch {\n        print(\"Unable to set the built-in mic as the preferred input.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n[View in Source](x-source-tag:\/\/EnableBuiltInMic)\n\n## Configure the Microphone Input’s Directionality\nTo configure the microphone input’s directionality, the sample sets its data source’s preferred polar pattern and the session’s input orientation. It performs this configuration in its `selectRecordingOption(_:orientation)`  method, which it calls whenever the user rotates the device or changes the recording option selection.\n\n```swift\nfunc selectRecordingOption(_ option: RecordingOption, orientation: Orientation, completion: (StereoLayout) -> Void) {\n    \n    \/\/ Get the shared audio session.\n    let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()\n    \n    \/\/ Find the built-in microphone input's data sources,\n    \/\/ and select the one that matches the specified name.\n    guard let preferredInput = session.preferredInput,\n          let dataSources = preferredInput.dataSources,\n          let newDataSource = dataSources.first(where: { $0.dataSourceName == option.dataSourceName }),\n          let supportedPolarPatterns = newDataSource.supportedPolarPatterns else {\n        completion(.none)\n        return\n    }\n    \n    do {\n        isStereoSupported = supportedPolarPatterns.contains(.stereo)\n        \/\/ If the data source supports stereo, set it as the preferred polar pattern.\n        if isStereoSupported {\n            \/\/ Set the preferred polar pattern to stereo.\n            try newDataSource.setPreferredPolarPattern(.stereo)\n        }\n\n        \/\/ Set the preferred data source and polar pattern.\n        try preferredInput.setPreferredDataSource(newDataSource)\n        \n        \/\/ Update the input orientation to match the current user interface orientation.\n        try session.setPreferredInputOrientation(orientation.inputOrientation)\n\n    } catch {\n        fatalError(\"Unable to select the \\(option.dataSourceName) data source.\")\n    }\n    \n    \/\/ Call the completion handler with the updated stereo layout.\n    completion(StereoLayout(orientation: newDataSource.orientation!,\n                            stereoOrientation: session.inputOrientation))\n}\n```\n[View in Source](x-source-tag:\/\/SelectDataSource)\n\nThis method finds the data source with the selected name, sets its preferred polar pattern to stereo, and then sets it as the input’s preferred data source. Finally, it sets the preferred input orientation to match the device’s user interface orientation.\n#documentation #iP12PM #i ",

    "content" : "# General Handset Opining\nI was just about to Tweet “I’m surprised there’s not a better solution for browsing\/interacting with Stack Overflow on iOS” before stopping myself and realizing what’s probably the general word among the stack types: *just use your web browser*. This led to a key differentiation I want to make. I often lament the recent emphasis on the development of Progressive Web Apps, Electron apps, and other variations of web browser-based containers masquerading as desktop-class software, saying the same thing: we really need to remember how powerful modern web browser are and accept that right now, a huge amount of what one should seek to do on a desktop-class operating system, specifically, instead of a mobile OS like iOS, is going to be done on the web from within a desktop web browser. I realize this direction of desktop development which I find detestable is the result of the industry’s fairly-recent emphasis on combining mobile and desktop operating systems\/desire to create a platform mutable enough to work on both. \n\nObviously, there are benefits to be had from the influence mobile OSs have had on traditional desktop OS development. The recent, quite monumental rollout of ARM-based Macs has probably been the single most poignant real-world example, ever, but I just wish to say this\n\n#iP12PM",

    "content" : "# Echoes in Twitter Spaces\n![](Echoes%20in%20Twitter%20Spaces\/Photo%20Mar%2012,%202021%20at%20001247.jpg)\n## Periscope’s successor is explicitly built to silence those who are unable to or uncomfortable with using their voice.\nToday, I came to a few revelations that led me to feel obligated to write about Twitter’s “new” live audio broadcasting feature, Spaces. Considering how much I read on a daily basis on media and the web, it’s quite pitiful that I would end up discovering their existence as the majority of eventual users will, I suspect: the app relaunching lands on the Home tab, which now features the Instagram Stories-derived Fleets gallery as the top header. I’m not sure \nle pictures - all people I followed in the decade+ before I hit my limit., but often cannot recall when or why. Suffice it to say, it’s unlikely I would easily run out of Fleets to watch if I ever find myself in a stage of obsessive Fleet consumption. Spaces only came to my attention when I happened to spot a *purple* cluster of rounded profile pictures in this menu. Naturally, I tapped immediately, and found myself in a Space run by [Matt Daniels](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mygunisquick) and including [Mike Elgan](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mikeelgan) as speaker. You might notice, now, following those hyperlinks, that both have the Purple Circle emoji 🟣 in front of their display names on their Profiles. They explained that it’s become a trend among those who’ve been granted Spaces access to indicate that they are testing and *discussing* Spaces.\n\nI was lucky to happen upon this particular Space - Matt was a fairly-prolific Periscope broadcaster, and that dearest app came up in the conversation just as I was approved as a speaker to mention it. I noted that I’d heard Spaces was built atop the technology Twitter acquired from Periscope in its acquisition and cited [my recent observations](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1260074702204293121) of my own experiences on that late service, asking whether or not Spaces would eventually meet a similar fate. I’d been suggesting that Periscope was the only entirely-positive social network experience I’d ever encountered, noting that I still wasn’t instinctively compelled to open the app nearly as much as I should have been, however. Matt’s response was quite profound: as a regular and popular Periscope broadcaster, his perspective was that its fundamental problem lied in insufficient filtering of its text chat. He said that Spaces’ exclusion of that feature was an important component of its potential, along with the fundamental implications behind new guests being muted by default. I hadn’t yet figured out a method of recording Spaces (more on that in a bit,) so I would qualify my account of this conversation in a big way, but I vaguely recall Mike chiming in to relay a sentiment he’d heard from Twitter employees in another recent Space: they understood and explicitly intended to continue in the text chat-less direction because of feedback from Periscope creators like Matt.\n\nFor myself, the general praise of Spaces (and Clubhouse, adjacently) as a democratizing new social feature definitely resonates. In just that first experience, I was given the opportunity to speak directly to Matt and Mike - the later of whom I have been reading and listening to for my whole adult life. He even followed me after the Space ended. Yesterday, I happened upon a Space hosted by [Ben Popper](https:\/\/twitter.com\/benpopper?s=21) - formerly one of my favorites on *The Verge*’s masthead - in which he was broadcasting [his impressively-disciplined turkey calls](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/ben-poppers-turkey-calls-46198) from “a shed in the woods.” He approved me as speaker immediately and was incredibly accommodating of my questions about his former colleagues and  recent life events. (He’s now living “rurally” and working as Director of Content at Stack Overflow - neither of which I would have ever expected.)\n\n[February 17th Sam Scheffer Space Embed] \n```\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZZH-SHzE8XQ\n```\n\nYet another former *Verge* staffer, [Sam Scheffer](https:\/\/twitter.com\/samsheffer), has been the most active Spaces user on my Timeline. Notably, he is one of the only Twitter Tech Media folks I know who has continued to be honest with himself and the world about his feelings about the service. Among a crop of people who once exclaimed shit like “I *love* Twitter” and “I *live* on Twitter,” his singular continued use of such terms reflects something significant, I think. Understandably given Tump Hell, it is now very popular to lament Twitter whenever possible, even among those who’s volume of use has not changed in any measurable way. I don’t think it’s reaching to say that Sam and I are alike in our desire to try out whatever we’re tossed the keys to in as extreme a degree as possible. I’ve stopped by a handful of his Spaces - which are often also about Spaces, itself. Most recently however, he approved me to speak in a Space including a host of Silicon Valley folk and at least one Microsoft employee, talking about the future of AR and VR, vaguely in response to Microsoft’s Ignite event, which legitimately disturbed me.\n\n[Scary Ignite Thing Embed]\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1366804088629919744\n\nI probably waited too long to speak up, until he was trying to wrap up the Space - but I did chime in about the way the Ignite keynote made me feel and attempted to convey the contrast between the goals of the tech industry and the general attitudes toward AR and VR present in the Midwesterners around me. Essentially, I was granted yet another unique *opportunity* to ask a question that’s been bothering me for years, now: *what the fuck are you doing and why???* It was the Microsoft Man (I can’t find his account, now, sorry) who responded very promptly, considering, with an explanation that actually made a lot of sense. The gist of it was *we are contending with the idea that we may never work in an office again, and these technologies offer a difficult-to-explain amends*. He specifically used the term “fatigue” in describing his own experiences trying to collaborate remotely and reflected on the benefits of virtual context on the most elemental, sensory components of interaction throughout a workday. From that ~45 second response, I feel as though I gained more understanding than I have from years of reading on my own, which further reinforces his observations, in retrospect.\n\n~~[[Kali Tweet Embed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kalibration\/status\/1371021244762619904)]~~ (Kali’s account is private right now.) \n\nAlready, it would seem Twitter Spaces might have a lot to offer David Blue, going forward. Though I signed up for Clubhouse’s waiting list last year (twice, in fact, but please don’t tell on me,) I have yet to hear back from them. If I was a bitter person, I would be up in arms about this, citing the fact that I would probably contribute more to the wellbeing of the project, technically, than 90% of those who’ve been invited. (I am the physical manifestation of the *Stress Test*, and I spend an absurd amount of time on beta feedback, [even on software *I’m fucking paying for*](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1362822335041048577).) From what I originally heard, though, Clubhouse was showing real promise as a space where creators of color felt in control of their experience. I hope this has continued to be true and - if it has - I say *never* invite me. \n\n[Buhby Periscope Embed]\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DajJqoufzAg\n\n## The Social and The Socialites\nCrucially, though, enabling [my tech bro ass](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1370838780333146118) to engage with famous tech bros about tech bro shit is never going to justifiably occupy anyone’s list of priorities in my lifetime (including my own.) The original promise of the internet did not include amplification of voices already\/otherwise at max volume. Instead, it was using technology to deliver new, varying, and universally-empowering tools of expression to those who’d been minimized for all of human history. It didn’t have to be philanthropic - in fact, it was and shall always remain in the best interest of the loudest folks to hear from the other side of the spectrum. The possibilities of this dynamic should be *thrilling* to all involved, and it used to be for Twitter, Inc. Or so it seemed, anyway. As the company has honed its various loglines over the years, their actions have reflected their truth less and less. \n\n[[Kayvon Beykpour Interview Embed](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/65yv6gvutNjjCrF4oeQFlc)]\n\nCoincidentally, the most visible co-founder of Periscope, [Kayvon Beykpour](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kayvz), is now Twitter’s Head of Consumer product, and he spent this past week doing interviews about Twitter’s late feature frenzy. I want to share two very different podcast episodes with two very different interviewers. [Nilay Patel’s *Decoder* interview](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22319527\/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder) should probably be first priority as the more comprehensive and digestible of the two.\n\n> We started it from the standpoint of “why are people not tweeting?” It turns out that some of the reasons they’re not tweeting is they don’t feel safe. They don’t feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they’re such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we’ve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you’re just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that.   \n\n“Why are people not tweeting” justifies us taking a moment to indulge some hilarity: imagine Jack and his hellbeard wandering around the abandoned Twitter office screaming that question at the walls, over and over again. Bekypour’s decision to identify one’s “on the public record” Tweets as “terrifying” could easily be tossed back at the company in the center of a dense globule of shit, but one imagines it’d hardly be constructive. I’m going to take my furthest leap here and suggest that we examine who exactly Kayvon was considering - those who find on Twitter a “popularity context of likes and retweets and impressions,” and feel “intimidated” by it. Those I’ve known on Twitter who’ve had negative experiences or have otherwise felt the need to take greater control of a given moment’s interactions generally make use of the “Protect My Tweets” selection in their account’s privacy settings. (This is called “private Twitter,” in case you’re unfamiliar.) This was clearly on the minds of whoever crafted [the official Twitter Support page on Spaces](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/spaces):\n\n> Accounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people’s Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.  \n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about this and come to the conclusion that Kayvon was speaking of a relative minority of Twitter users in his explanation, consciously or not. It’s telling that I was unable to find the statistics of an average Twitter account’s number of daily interactions, but it also means I have to make yet another supposition: even most *regular* Twitter users rarely experience an overwhelming amount of what I’ll call account-specific notifications (mentions, replies, likes, and retweets, as distinct from algorithmically-sourced content recommendations.) I could be wrong, but I would argue that only the most popular Twitter users - those most visible by way of all sorts of celebredom - are under pressure to consider “the public record.” When Kayvon explains Twitter’s interest in making Spaces ephemeral, he is speaking for the “clients” who make Twitter a (debatably) viable **business**. This should not be surprising or damning, necessarily, but only so long as it is emphasized.\n\n[[Voice Note Embed](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/twitter-spaces)]\n\nEarly in the interview, Nilay “reframes” the pillars of Twitter’s current development as described by Bekypour. “Health,” he observes, “is basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.” A large, most uncomfortable component of this “problem,” is just another manifestation of the age-old dynamic between celebrities and everyone else. The tools Twitter is building along this line are designed to enable the social upper class (if you will) to better manage their interactions with the masses. Abstractly, Twitter sounds like an inherently democratizing space as described to an unfamiliar party. The personal experiences with Spaces I outlined were undoubtedly democratizing *for me*, but the essence of this new direction Twitter has taken - led by the co-mastermind of what I would call the most democratized social platform of our time - is an explicit, clearer-than-ever commitment to amplify the already\/otherwise amplified voices which belt the song of popular relevancy.\n\n[ [Alex Kantrowitz’s Kayvon Bekypour Interview](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec) Embed]\n\n## Scope History in Scope\nThe [other important Bekypour interview](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec) comes via Alex Kantrowitz’s *Big Technology Podcast*, who is notably much less Vox media glossy than Nilay in his questions. When he asks why Spaces ended up looking so similar to Clubhouse, Bekypour responds with an revealing anecdote on Periscope’s story:\n\n> Well, we’ve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it’s funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology.  \n\nIndeed, it was under Twitter’s tenure that Periscope [first added audio-only broadcasting](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/07\/twitter-launches-audio-only-broadcasting-feature-on-its-ios-app-and-periscope\/) in September 2018, followed by [audio-only guest call-ins](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/04\/periscopes-latest-feature-turns-your-broadcast-into-a-radio-talk-show\/) in February of the next year. My occasional check-ins with the community and brief skim of the iOS app’s release notes suggest that Periscope’s technical development staff were then quickly diverted to other projects, fired, or killed. The language in the service’s self-published Medium obituary is aggravatingly avoidant of any responsibility for the state of disrepair Periscope has subsequently found itself in:\n\n> The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while.  \n\n*We have no idea how this happened! What a tragedy! Our sympathies.*\n\n> Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.  \n\nRead: News networks don’t bother to simulcast to Periscope anymore and we can’t remember the last time any sort of celebrity said something controversial enough on our platform to get pscp.tv in the news. “Nobody at the wheel” has been my recent favorite idiom to staple on software\/services that have remained “on the market,” so to speak - still taking money\/account signups\/other contemporary manifestations of currency exchange, and yet *appear* abandoned under varying degrees of scrutiny. (Clyp.it is the most [recently relevant](https:\/\/bit.ly\/enduserwhyp) example I’ve investigated.) I should disclaim that I have no idea what it’s like to work for a software company - my only *real* technology employment was for a small-time IT company. I should also disclose that my intentional exploration of the open source\/open web\/decentralized community since early 2018 has definitely incubated a few biases toward the abstract idealism present in their preferred methodologies. What I’m really saying: I find the whole spectrum of secrecy purveyed and practiced in the realm of proprietary software *utterly absurd*. The fact that I and others on the beat must *speculate* if we’re to discuss the history of a given app’s development in any detail is ridiculous for many reasons which are inappropriate to dive into, here.\n\n![Unrequited Twitter Spaces Support DM](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tEvlLAkm.jpeg)\n![](Echoes%20in%20Twitter%20Spaces\/Photo%20Mar%2024,%202021%20at%20032103.jpg)\n\nA relevant, real-world example of the sort of silly mysteriousness this attitude manifests is the process by which I gained “early” access to Twitter Spaces on my main account, [@NeoYokel](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel), over the course of this writing. I noticed it’d been enabled almost exactly 24 hours after the timestamp on the DM (screenshotted above) I sent [@TwitterSpaces](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterSpaces) from [@dieselgoth](https:\/\/twitter.com\/dieselgoth) - an alt I created last year mostly to spare my longtime followers from live racing Tweet spam which was granted Spaces access first, despite having been almost 100% dormant for months. I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to assume my main account was explicitly\/manually given access by a Twitter employee  as a direct result of that message, but I’ll never know for sure because it has yet to receive any response. As I [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1374639645833711616), I am far from personally up in arms because Twitter, Incorporated decided to *leave me on read*, but my young imagination conjures a million scenarios involving different sorts of people in which such a lack of acknowledgement certainly *would* be quite a deal, justifiably or not. All I’d ask is *for what reason, exactly*? \n\nThe most essential acknowledgement I must make, though, is that the two Spaces I’ve started since gaining access received absolutely zero engagement, despite the latter being timed and labeled as optimally as I could personally manage *and* left open for more than an hour. This is in stark contrast to my early experiences on Periscope, especially, which were the heavyweights contributing to the sum of interactions throughout the history of my account, there. Of further note for context: **I garnered a more voluminous, active “following” on Periscope than I have on any other social media service** throughout the history of my internet presence. I felt it important to spell this out in the hope that this post would not become (or be regarded as) rudimentary bitching about how this story effects *me*, because it technically does - in a very specific, crucial manner - more than any other subject discussed in *The Psalms*. (If it comes across that way, or if you have any other thoughts to share, I would love nothing more than to “[hear](https:\/\/bit.ly\/dbrolodex)” them and optionally add them to this post.) I would hope my work has come across as *unnecessarily* (perhaps even *aggravatingly*) transparent, this far, but it’s especially essential in this case. As I continue to cite my experiences on my Periscope\/Twitter account(s,) I would also like to emphasize that I do so because 1) I don’t want to speak for anyone else and 2) I have access\/control to their full documentation as well as my own permission to share it as needed, **not** because I think (or would argue) that my experience on Twitter properties, going forward, should be served or optimized for in any way. I haven’t already invested two weeks in this subject at this point for the sake of improving my own online life, but to speak for those uncomfortable with revealing their voice (regarding text chat omission in Spaces,) and to critically reflect on what Spaces’ lack of discoverability (in contrast with Periscope, particularly) might mean for all Twitter users.\n\nWhile we’re this deep in the meta, let me also confess to you that I had long intended to write a thorough celebratory essay detailing my positive experiences on Periscope, but put it off too long. I’ve decided that this post shall have to take its place, so I’m therefore going to share the unedited draft of that essay from last summer in its entirety, now, marked by horizontal lines:\n\n- - - -\n[[A Good Place: Periscope Magic]]\n\n> Through this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I've spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn't understand each other whatsoever. I've streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.  \n\n> In 2015-2016, I worked afternoons (3-11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I'd sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like [Juanita](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Jquinta) and [Nicole](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Nicole3) were made. [Ashers](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/OMFGAshers) bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)  \n- - - -\n![](Echoes%20in%20Twitter%20Spaces\/Photo%20Mar%2025,%202021%20at%20172836.jpg)\n\n## A Jaunt to Preserve; A Dirge\nIndeed, that is where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Given just the exchanges I’ve had about Periscope in the past week, I suspect I would find writing its full history in non-fiction narrative form to be an incredible, desperately unique experience, just as the app has. As I write, the mobile app, itself, has five and half days left to live (before it’s removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.) Early yesterday morning, as I opened the app to my feed, I was unable to find any recent or currently-live broadcasts which made any mention of this reality, despite spirited scrolling. The same uncanny noise of Periscope’s trademark, infinitely-wide spectrum of use continued beneath the banner embedded above, which was only *very* recently updated with The End’s specific date. It doesn’t really agitate my own personal urgency, either (if you cared to know,) because I’ve endured the luxury of existence from a perspective of such thorough latency with reality for so long that I have all but forgotten the experience of actually expecting to finish anything on time. Regarding Periscope, I have felt a special guilt for years, feeling like I’ve continued to take it for granted. I didn’t stop in enough - I’ve spent far too much of the past 6-7 years fucking around with custom Word keyboard shortcuts that always break more or less instantly and fooling around with Garageband for iOS when I could have been listening, watching, chatting, learning, collaborating, or even just straight up pontificating with people from all over the world, on Periscope.\n\nIt’s been obvious for a long time, now, that the software had no future at Twitter, Inc, which - as far as I can tell - hasn’t really affected user behavior in any significant way. My mom pointed out something profound as I tried to explain why I’ve been so focused on this: somewhere, there is surely a sizable mass of standard user data from Periscope’s lifetime, and it would surely be *the* most purely fascinating information of its kind to study just for the hell of it, which is precisely why it will probably be forgotten, entirely. I could be wrong, but weighed as a whole, Periscope seems like the truest manifestation of The Original Web Dream (as I understand it) to exist - at least post-Web Two. As I have observed it since the earliest days of its public beta, Periscope’s userbase spanned a wider variety of human life than any other single digital credential holder I can remember. Its design seemed to ultimately reward sincere engagement and commitment from its creator-bent “class,” who seemed to benefit in turn from the resulting social contact in a linear fashion. Crucially, though, something about the way Periscope was built seemed to make it **virtually impervious to echo chambers**. Frankly, you just couldn’t stick around as a broadcaster if you weren’t at least *open* to an unfailingly unpredictable experience. I personally found this key element to be an absolute riot… Magic the likes of which can be found in any other online space.\n\n\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1260074702204293121\n\n[[Periscope Preservation Gist](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/614effdd51bac74793ef627a1174e972) Embed] \n\n## The Magic Left Out",

I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.  \n\nConsider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER…” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. Would you have made out on your first date with someone in your 80s high school Chemistry class after they’d was about but suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. “The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”\n\n- Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their regularity. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re trying to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or both.\n- This issue is not unique to American society nor to men, really, but is entirely the sickness of white boomers and gen Xers.

A big moment.\n\nWe’re seeing an explosion of players in the space: up to 30 at analyst and thought leader Jeremiah Owyang’s last count, and soon to be over 100. Owyang is an analyst at [Kaleido Insights](https:\/\/www.kaleidoinsights.com), and shared his data on the emerging space on his personal site, [Web Strategist](https:\/\/web-strategist.com\/blog\/2021\/01\/30\/the-future-of-social-audio-startups-roadmap-business-models-and-a-forecast\/).\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning. We’ll see an explosion of hundreds of supporting and ecosystem apps in social audio shortly, says Owyang.\n\nI caught up with Jeremiah recently on [TechFirst](https:\/\/johnkoetsier.com\/category\/tech-first\/) to chat about social audio: why it’s hot, what’s happening, what’s driving this trend, who the key players are, why it’s here to stay, and what innovation this new sector will give birth to.\n\nScroll down for video, audio, and a full transcript.\n\n**[Click here for the Forbes story based on this interview …](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johnkoetsier\/2021\/03\/15\/why-social-audio-blew-up-and-why-clubhouse-and-twitter-spaces-will-spawn-thousands-of-apps\/)**\n\n- - - -\n\n*(This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.)*  \n\n**John Koetsier:** Welcome, Jeremiah! \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Hey, John. So good to see you, at least from a distance. \n\n**John Koetsier:** It is so good to see you too. It’s been a long time. It’s been over a year since we’ve seen each other in person. I am so pumped to chat with you because audio is crazy hot right now. And you are kind of— \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** But we’re doing video. \n\n**John Koetsier:** I *know,* we’re doing video too but [ *laughter* ] … we’re talking about audio and it’s crazy hot right now, and you’re kind of really on the cusp of what’s happening there. You’ve got your finger on the pulse. You’ve just released a major report as well. And I guess I’ll start here: what on earth is going on with audio right now?\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Well, we are all segmented in our homes and that has been the main driver here. You know, we are really just trying to reconnect with each other. \n\n> And what we found is during the quarantine, is that text messaging just doesn’t give us the emotion and the nuance that the human condition requires, especially during isolation. On the flip side — aside from this amazing show — Zoom calls and video shows are just too taxing on people.  \n\nLike right now, I’m staring at a camera because I want to look good to everybody who’s watching, but that can be straining over time to always just look into the camera, because your face is actually a few inches over. And then you have to make sure do you look good even though you feel horrible inside for all the reasons that we know. Is my background clean? You know, are there kids around?\n\n> So in between is what we call the Goldilocks medium — not too much, not too little — and that’s social audio. Real-time audio.  \n\n**John Koetsier:** That is maybe the best explanation I’ve heard so far. And I totally get what you’re saying about video, because it’s funny, we video conference and we stare at our own faces. We’re video conferencing, we’re loo king — do I look good? Do I look stupid? [ *laughing* ]\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** It’s the vanity instinct, you know? Like, oh no, right [ *pretend preening* ] — everybody’s doing that, and nobody’s looking at anybody else. They’re just checking their own face. \n\n**John Koetsier:** Exactly. Exactly. So audio is having a moment. You did a major report on that. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Thanks.\n\n**John Koetsier:** We see a *lot* of players … I think you calculated something like 30 different players here.\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** 30 players. \n\n> So the category is called social audio. The leader in the space is Clubhouse, but Twitter Spaces also has a beta product out and I’ve been testing it. Facebook also announced that they will have their own social audio product. Mark Cuban announced his own, called Fireside.  \n\nAnd there’s actually 30 total companies and more coming on my list.\n\nSome of them are for specific verticals, like there’s one that emerged called Angle that’s really focused on the Swiss-German market. There’s one that’s called Saga, which is supposed to be for you and your parents to communicate and to even record stories for the future. There’s another one out called — is it Seventh Avenue, I think, which is for Black Americans to communicate with each other. So there’s variations across this — it is a growing category, and frankly well-funded in that the huge tech companies are in here now.\n\n**John Koetsier:** So I love what you said earlier about, you know, video doesn’t really cut it because we’re so focused on our appearance and what’s going on there. Also we have to kind of look good, you can’t just let your default ‘resting B face’ be out there that I typically have as well. Right? \n\nSo, but audio, you can do a few other things. You can do things, it does take time though, right? It does take time. It’s a very different feeling than a text-based or a mixed media social network like a Facebook or a Twitter or something like that. What’s different about it, particularly?\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** You come as you are. \n\n> You don’t have to be wearing your business suit. You don’t have to be wearing clothes, frankly. Some people don’t, apparently. It doesn’t matter, nobody’s going to see you. You come as you are and you tell your story, like you can hear that in the voice and the emotion. And you can really communicate in a way that text doesn’t.  \n\nAnd so really that’s why we see this huge trend of all of these companies and people want to connect with strangers. People want to reconnect with old friends. We are *longing* to be with each other. Like John, if I saw you again, like we’ve been at many conferences, I’d give you a big hug right now if it was safe to do, right?  \n\n**John Koetsier:** Super uncomfortable. [ *laughing* ]\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yeah, don’t cough on me.\n\n**John Koetsier:** I’m just joking. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** But you can see. I mean, we just — it’s the human condition to be with our clan, and social audio is the best thing we can do. \n\n**John Koetsier:** One thing that Chris Voss said — and Chris runs a bunch of different podcasts and he’s getting into Clubhouse big time — is that you don’t have to be super hot, super good-looking by conventional standards. You can just be yourself. It’s your voice and what you say— \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Your ideas. \n\n**John Koetsier:**  And the quality of your ideas. Agree? \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yes. And how you treat other people — that comes out. Do you interrupt people, right? \n\n**John Koetsier:** That’s a really interesting point. I heard that on Clubhouse yesterday. I’ve tuned in a variety of times. I’m not huge on the platform, but I’ve tuned in a variety of times. \n\n> I heard it last night, and somebody was saying you get a nuance to voice that you don’t get via text. So you don’t know … am I joking right now? Am I laughing right now? Am I concerned? Am I angry? Am I, you know, unless you’re going all caps and using lots of emojis, you really can’t get that nuance with texts, can you?  \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** You just can’t. And that’s really, I mean, this isn’t new, we’ve had party lines, and phones, and conference calls before, right? But now we’re meeting with strangers and having these sometimes deep conversations around topics that are so meaningful to us; or business conversations to talk about what the future of the industry is; or just casual chit chats and like you would be hanging out with your friends at the bar, and people are actually drinking martinis while they’re hanging out with their actual friends, or the new friends that they just met, or friends they haven’t met yet that are in the room. \n\nSo there’s many different use cases that really all map to the human condition as us, as social creatures.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Let’s ping in on the big kahuna, or the one that you said is leading the category, which is Clubhouse. \n\nHow has Clubhouse done it — right place, right time? I mean, there’s a bit of that in every startup, right? And maybe a set of features that works and not too many, not too much. What has really done it for Clubhouse? Why has that one taken off so much?\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yes, the timing was right. \n\n> They launched in March. Quarantine started in … March for many places. So their timing was perfect and they started with some tech influencers and they invited in VCs. Then they invited in the Black entertainment community who brought in lots of hands and many stars. And then it grew out from there, and so that was a really brilliant set of plays that they did. Intentional? Happenstance? Yeah. A little bit of both.  \n\nThe features are super easy to use. It’s just very simple to use it. There’s a mute button, you can go to different rooms and change your profile. You know, there’s no texting, there’s no emojis. You can communicate with the mute button or changing your profile photo, but mostly, 90% of it is your voice. And so that has been the main thing for that.\n\n**John Koetsier:** There’s been a draw to the exclusivity of it as well, right? \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** That’s true.\n\n**John Koetsier:** I mean, because you get invites when you use the system and then you are able to give those away, and people say, ‘I’ve got invites, who wants them?’ And everybody’s like clamoring. That’s kind of an interesting — we’ve seen that in other places as well. \n\nIt’s also iOS only. I mean, that’s kind of shocking. We’ve actually seen kind of clones come up on Android which are hacking into their API and distributing those conversations on Android as well.\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** So the team doesn’t mean to exclude Android, it’s that they’re just, they were just like three, four people for months. They just only had, you know, two iOS engineers. \n\n> They didn’t have an Android developer until *last week*.   \n\n**John Koetsier:** Wow!\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Okay. And if you know development, iOS is easier to develop on because there’s a constrained set of devices that are very specific and specifications made in only approved Apple factories, versus the Android ecosystem which is two thirds of the internet, or even broader three fourths … there are thousands of permutations of hardware. \n\n**John Koetsier:** Yeah. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** So it’s really around being efficient with resources as a small startup. They also just hired a new Android developer, a Black woman from *Medium* today. So we’re all celebrating her addition to the team. \n\nSo they need to hurry though, because Twitter Spaces mentioned that they will have an Android version next month. So that’s in the next three, four weeks and they could sweep the market underneath Clubhouse by getting Android out there if they can do that and have a scalable platform.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Well, that’s a great segue, because I’m kind of intrigued by Twitter Spaces. I’m not on it yet. I’ve participated in a couple of those sessions, and what’s neat there is it’s tied to an existing large network. It’s a newsy\/social network, right? And Twitter is shutting down Periscope. Your thoughts there? \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** One other really endearing feature, which is the hallmark of Twitter, is that your visual tweets are integrated into that actual Twitter Space. \n\n**John Koetsier:** Wow.\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** So you can actually go to a tweet and hit the ‘share’ button to your space, and there’s a carousel at the — so imagine this is the screen, oh, I can’t show you right now. \n\nThere’s the screen, at the top there’s a row of your tweets, and you can slide them and people will talk about the tweets in *real time*. So, imagine breaking news happening, photos emerging, and they’ve also promised that you can have a million people listening to a space, versus Clubhouse says— \n\n**John Koetsier:** 5,000.\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:**  Well it’s like seven now, but yes, the point is — Twitter knows how to scale. \n\n**John Koetsier:** Yes \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Twitter, I mean, they had their Fail Whale years and they’ve learned from that. \n\n> So I think there’s going to be a massive battle between that, and the celebrities and the brands and the marketers are already on Twitter. Their credit cards are already plugged in and their follower base is there. They’re already verified. So there’s going to be that battle.  \n\nBut I just want to make really one important point: there’s room for at least three social audio players in your phone for you to use every day. It’s not about one. Just think about all the social networks you have, how many different email accounts you have, how many different messaging platforms you have. You have at least three, and typically I see them in the following: first, biggest, and different.\n\nSo Clubhouse has got first. Whose biggest? It’s going to be Twitter probably, or Facebook. And then different, we’ll see some of those vertical ones. Like we might see a social audio just for cool people in Vancouver, as an example.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Mm-hmm. Super, super, super interesting. So, I asked in the prep doc, you know, who should we really be watching? You said enterprise social audio and social analytics. Can you expand on that a little bit? \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Sure. So in my post — you can check out my pinned tweet and see the whole post, and you’ll see there’s the — I made a number of predictions. \n\n> But there’s two product categories that are going to be emerging from this market. We can already see little, little tiny startups that are emerging that are doing these. One of them is called social audio analytics and, John, this is not new, you know social media analytics.  \n\n**John Koetsier:** Yes. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Remember Radian6 was acquired for $300 million by Salesforce? Ten years ago, they were scraping and getting API access to text-based social networks. Well, there’s going to be another startup that emerges that does the same thing for social audio streams, whether it’s in the terms of service or they just get a partnership for the API. \n\nThe second category is what we call enterprise social audio, and that’s the same features that we’ll see for your workplace. And here’s an example — I think you know this play — we saw Facebook and Twitter emerge and LinkedIn, then all of a sudden, Yammer, Chatter, and Socialcast, and then all the variations added to existing enterprise software. We’re going to see—\n\n**John Koetsier:** Facebook for work.\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Thank you. Yeah. We’re going to see all of that happen, you know, Webex might have social audio. Salesforce Slack is going to have social audio. It’s going to be everywhere. So in those cases where we have existing communication platforms, social audio will be a *feature*. But for companies like Clubhouse, social audio is the *product*.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Yeah. Yeah. Very, very interesting. I was wondering, as you’re listening to more and more social audio, does that cut into podcasts? Does that cut into podcast time? I’ve seen some people who are trying to do a podcast *and* the Clubhouse at the same time, and broadcast their podcast, like us talking, broadcasting on Clubhouse. Where do you see that going? \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yeah, it has cut into my podcast time. It really has. But the smart folks do integrate it. So Mitch Joel, my friend, he records his live podcast. We were doing this on Clubhouse, and then he replays it on Clubhouse, and then he has conversations about it on Clubhouse. So he’s repurposing the content, but he also brings in the crowd to ask questions of us, versus in a podcast … that wasn’t happening. \n\n**John Koetsier:** Yeah. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** So he’s trying — that’s a hybrid — so he’s really blending them together in a very innovative way, and really one of the first guys, not *the* first, but one of the first guys to try to do that.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Super interesting, because that was one of the things I was wondering about when I was getting interested in Clubhouse initially is, hey, I have these one-off conversations. Where does it go? Can I use that later? Can I save that? Can I extract the insights in that conversation by going speech-to-text? Those sorts of things, and so obviously that’s all coming. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yes. Those things are also coming as well. So, natural language processing, and you can see there’s real-time translations already in Twitter Spaces. You can see some people are speaking and it’s coming out a second later in English, which is fascinating to think about, like the AI capabilities that can harvest that information. Plus, of course, the sensibility for those that are hearing impaired. So there’s a lot of amazi— oh, and translation, instant translation country to country. \n\n**John Koetsier:** Yes. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Can you bring the world together? Like that’s an *amazing* concept to think about. Yes, I know text-based translation is not new, but there’s something more intimate when we have our voice to do that. \n\n**John Koetsier:** And it’s important. I mean, I have some Twitter followers who are blind, you know they can listen, that’s great. And there are some who can’t type, right? Differently abled. And so being able to do that with voice is great. This is really interesting for me, because talking — like we’re doing right now — is kind of the original technology for communication, right? Now it’s returning in digital form. You said, ‘Nothing new is new.’ \n\n> **Jeremiah Owyang:** So, here’s what I think about which technology will be adopted:  if it’s something that’s already innate to the human condition and tribal behavior, then you’ll get a high level of adoption. You and I were tracking social media from the early days. People want to talk and tell stories, right? This is…   \n\n**John Koetsier:** Yeah. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** It’s core to us. You and I were both there tracking the sharing economy, you know, villages would do this. This is how you would survive, to share resources. This is why we saw Airbnb and, in some cases, ride-sharing take off. And this is part of what we do. So if you see an existing behavior that’s amplified by technology, augmented by technology — and in this case, this is just giving us rich profiles, friends that we can find, conversations that are by different topics. So this is different, right? \n\nIt’s like, imagine you can go to 10 different conferences or festivals or coffee shops within the next two hours. That gives us instant access to all those social venues that we already know we want to do, but we can’t. Then it really helps to reinforce that we’re going to have that rapid adoption.\n\n**John Koetsier:** It just makes you wonder as well where conferences are going. I mean, assuming COVID passes at some level at some point and people want to do in-person conferences again, I can imagine doing that. \n\n> I can imagine wanting to do that. I can imagine wanting that travel, that in-person experience … but I can also imagine that there’s some challenges with competition, really. I mean, you can hear Marc Andreessen live, “in person” quote\/unquote, in audio on Clubhouse most nights, it seems like. He’s always, always on the service, right? And you don’t have to go to Las Vegas or somewhere else to the right conference for $3,000 to hear Marc Andreessen anymore.  \n\n  **Jeremiah Owyang:** Yes. In addition, those speakers though, may choose to go to the higher venue, higher paid speaking gigs. So they may pull off the platform when quarantine starts to end, resulting in this economic and societal change. \n\n> So I’m going to make a guess that we’ll see maybe a 30% reduction in social audio when the world can reopen again. And I think that’s, frankly, a good thing. We want to get back to you seeing each other physically.  \n\n**John Koetsier:** Mm-hmm. Excellent. Jeremiah, for those who are seeing you for the first time, or maybe know of you, have heard of you, but don’t know too much about you … you’ve got an amazing backdrop right there. Tell everybody real quick where you are and how you’ve created your own office for quarantine times. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yeah. So many people will think that it is a digital backdrop and I get that question a lot — and you probably will never believe me, and that’s okay too — but I do work in an Airstream, in my backyard, which I procured a number of years ago as a business expense. And since then, I’ve actually become an Airstream ambassador, helping them even thinking about the future of work. Because I’m not the only one to have an Airstream in their backyard and I won’t be the only — there’s many people that are doing that now. So, yes, I’m in an Airstream in my backyard. \n\n**John Koetsier:** That is amazing. You combine business and pleasure and opportunity like no one else. That is wonderful. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Thanks.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Maybe to finish off our conversation on social audio … at TechFirst, this podcast is about tech that’s changing the world and innovators who are shaping the future. Where do you see social audio in a year or two, and then maybe stretch your gaze a little bit and go out to a decade? \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Sure. So the next phase we’ll probably see obviously Android, and there will be a battle between Twitter and Facebook and all the other players I mentioned. After the quarantine is released and people go about the world we’ll see a shakeout in the market. \n\n> And — oh, I forecast there’ll be 100 players on my list by the end of the year.  \n\n**John Koetsier:** Wow.\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** One hundred. The cost of getting it going is easy. You can get a subscription with Agora, which is one of the underlying platforms for social and live video as well, so that’s why these companies can spin these instances up very quickly. \n\nSo we’ll see that a rapid pull out of the market and a shakeout, and that’ll be a good thing. At that point, we’ll also see these platforms offering APIs. Twitter already has an API for text-based tweets. Why wouldn’t they do that for social audio?\n\n> And at that point, we’ll see an *explosion* of *thousands* of apps, just like we do with Twitter apps, and Facebook apps, and Google apps. And so we’ll see that start to happen. At that point, we’ll also see that the embedding of social audio everywhere around the internet will start to happen, and I call that the colonization phase.   \n\nWhen, imagine you’re reading an article — tell me your favorite hobby, John.\n\n**John Koetsier:** I’ll say … working out. \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Fitness. So you’re reading MensHealth.com and you just read an awesome article around doing landmines, which is an exercise I know you like, and it’s talking about good form. \n\n> Imagine right there it says, ‘Click to listen to your friends talking with fitness instructors around how to do proper landmines. They’re doing it right now, do you want to join in, John?’ [ *laughter]* Of course you’re going to join, John.  \n\n**John Koetsier:** Take my credit card!\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yes. So the social audio experience will be embedded — might be recording too, right? Of the top fitness instructors and athletes doing and talking about doing landmines, which is a fun exercise. So it’s going to be decoupled from the app and it will be spread around the internet just as we saw likes and comments and emoticons from Facebook or Twitter embedded in other websites as well. \n\nThat same thing will happen in that radical future. So it’ll be decoupled in a way in this colonization. So there’s just a few predictions that I have.\n\n> Also, of course, we will be in social audio platforms talking to Alexa and Siri, they’ll be right next to us. It will be normal for us to have conversations with AI bots and that’ll be something that we get used to. I mean, we do it in our home. Why wouldn’t we do it in a social setting as well? So there’s just a few ideas to sink into your teeth. I have more ideas about the future, but that’s just a few.  \n\n**John Koetsier:** Excellent. One thing that came to mind as you were talking there, you mentioned Twitter again. Twitter has been rumored to come out with some kind of subscription or some kind of paid level of service, and I can totally see how they’re going to work the audio into that as well, right, and have some paid level of service — follow people, connect with people. \n\n> I think that’s going to be a whole other revenue stream for them and possibly a significant growth driver as well, because we’ve seen all that growth going away to various different Patreon type sites, OnlyFans type sites, you know, Subscript, that sort of thing … and Twitter can get in on that action.  \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yes, and\/or they could share the advertising revenue with the creators as well. So there’s another way to generate revenue and plus there’s crypto coins and personal coins, which I am looking at that model for creators as well. \n\nSo yeah, there’s actually over 15 ways that social audio companies can generate revenue. You can even have premium features for users and those revenues could go to the creator. So there’s many ways to do this.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Yep. Excellent. Jeremiah, where can people find you? I mean, you’re a Google away, but…\n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Yeah. You can just find me on Twitter @jowyang, you can see the spelling of my name. And then my company is KaleidoInsights.com.\n\n**John Koetsier:** Wonderful. Great to have you. Thank you so much! \n\n**Jeremiah Owyang:** Thank you, sir.\n\n[Clubhouse. Twitter Spaces.

    "content" : "# ‘Mom and Dad’’s Discrepant Defense Against Stale Industry and the Population Problem\n\n![Nicolas Cage](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HitpxbS.jpeg)\n\n## A 'fun' movie\n\nThe Earth will reach its maximum occupancy load (12 billion) when I am in my mid-fifities, meaning there’ll be more than twice as many gorging, shitting, shooting, complaining, and lying human beings than there were when I started, and perhaps Brian Taylor’s *Mom and Dad* is in fact a reasoned argument for a particular solution to our inevitable plight. I’m still not sure what a “cult” movie is, precisely, but I can’t imagine what sort of cult could possibly sustain itself around the ethos of this film alone, despite its concise, agitating, at once lighthearted, yet genuinely-disturbing trip. No, it is probably not propaganda. From the experts, you’ll get *precisely* the same review, varying only in length. *The New York Times*’ Glenn Kenny [couldn’t be bothered](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/01\/18\/movies\/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html) with more than 250 words, but RogerEbert dot com’s Simon Abrams [shelled out a whole 1000](https:\/\/www.rogerebert.com\/reviews\/mom-and-dad-2018). They are suspiciously close to these big round numbers — perhaps each was written to respective quotas, and perhaps you could say all that could reasonably be said in 10, but I don’t care.\n\nThe tropes here are polished to a miraculous sheen — two emotionally-stunted, middleaged, overly preoccupied-with-their-lost-youth suburban parents (Nicolas Cage and Selma Blair) who’s existing envies & irritations regarding their own classically bratty teenage girl (Anne Winters) and her mischievous little brother (Zackary Arthur) is merely agitated by a sudden TV static-bound killer instinct into bloodlust, not originated. I’m not sure any pill dealer would actually flip off their customers after a fair buy — even in high school, but *drugs*, a *black boyfriend*, and a *stinkbomb*? in the old Trans Am!? *I’m going to kill you!*\n\nSomebody, somewhere knew all the best sources on suburbia and how to put them to good use. The Camry, the golf bag, ping pong smashing, sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and *Dr. Oz*, for Christ’s sake! Granted, talking to your girlfriend\/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dated — especially while riding a BMX — and I don’t think Froot Loops are generally accepted middle-class chow anymore. These are staples from *my* youth, and I am very old. Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics are more chronographically appropriate, but with great consequence, I fear — if we’re going to accept them once and for all as authentic mechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age faster than Nick’s new jowls (unless we’re all soon killed by our parents.) It’s been two years since I knew anything about music, but I seriously doubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are listening to [Father-esque post-Memphis horrorcore](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/billsaberdotcom\/iknowupussiesdontwantit) in class — there’s something about SoundCloud that really clashes with chokers.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https:\/\/w.soundcloud.com\/player\/?url=https%3A\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/273824044&color=%2300006b&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"><\/iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/thebillsaber\" title=\"BILL $ABER\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">BILL $ABER<\/a> · <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/thebillsaber\/iknowupussiesdontwantit\" title=\"I KNOW THAT YOU PUSSIES DONT WANT IT Prod The Virus And Antidote\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">I KNOW THAT YOU PUSSIES DONT WANT IT Prod The Virus And Antidote<\/a><\/div>\n\nIf there was ever a film in which to use grimy dubstep-influenced electronic slaps, buzzes, chirps, and great grating clanking, it’s this one. It’s a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly about their use of the most intimate medium. One forgets its potential to control the nuances of an audience’s fear, anger, discomfort, and panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating, distressing, ghastly gross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio production such as that of *Mom and Dad*. If you want to judge Academically the *effectiveness* of a nominee’s work for an award with a title like Best Sound Editing (as opposed to whatever the hell criteria was met most fully by *Skyfall*,) you *must* give the little golden man to these folks, whoever they are.\n\n![Mom & Dad Sound Department](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/CQm0cIN.png)\n\nWhen’s the last time you saw a truly, believably shitty modern parental pair on a big screen? I really can’t remember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft — both a perfect précis *and* thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even *named* unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar, impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage [scream](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MSmJFMabfJc) it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first [memorize the entire screenplay](http:\/\/comicbook.com\/horror\/2018\/01\/08\/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor\/) and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially “my mom is such a penis.”\n\n*Mom and Dad* could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s *I Am Legend* if for no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan — even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself [described ](http:\/\/variety.com\/video\/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage\/)it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying *National Treasure*, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree — this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing such boundaries is a core function of a film like *Mom and Dad.* Nobody ended up vomiting or anything.\n\nThis *fun* thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism — truly, this is a film charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with *Winchester* (just so you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.)

    "content" : "# Bandcamp, Streaming's Secret Savior\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever thought to yourself *wow, Bandcamp has looked basically the same forever*, you were entirely correct – now for a tenth of the century, at least – and you’ll be hard-pressed to find another Silicon Valley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such casual, yet robust long-standing user relationships underneath an unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under the most ludicrous scrutiny, the company’s rudder is flawless and its course true. What at first glance you’d swear to be an unsolicited conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as *cheesy*, *stubborn*, *dweebish*, *pious*, or just generally *boring*, indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we’ve suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world’s computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least *ponder* for a beat. The volume of the masses’ exponentially-increasing attendance of late is only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: **selling good** **music**. \r\n\r\nThe platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and labels with a clean, cozy, charming, smartly-designed and technically competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal search engine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in exchange for 15% of any sales that should come in – [significantly less](https:\/\/medium.com\/@gloom303\/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930) than other channels; *half* what Apple Music will take. In examining Bandcamp’s history, its impact on independent music, and its viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.\r\n\r\n[ANDREW JERVIS-FACE THE MUSIC](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/user-27545025-81127248\/in-conversation-with-bandcamps) \r\n\r\nTo catch our starting gun, we must first travel to *Face The Music 2016* in Melbourne – as far as one can possibly get from The Valley – alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, [Andrew Jervis](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/andrewjervis) to observe his interview for a live audience.\r\n\r\n> Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically. There’s never actually been any advertising that we’ve done; there’s never any advertising on the site, and there never will be. We haven’t really tooted our horn very hard.\r\n\r\nIn fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those who beget its conception to the on-the-nose care in their person-to-person customer service is so adamantly inverse of the tech industry archetype which the global End User community at large are presently discovering at twice the speed of sound there should *at least* be some conspiratorializing going around. Where I come from, launching a desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp’s case, even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and include *any* sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat tape. He wouldn’t even send antihistamines.\r\n\r\n[ETHAN DIAMOND AT XOXO FESTIVAL 2014](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MaUkS-lr-ZM)\r\n\r\nAs uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp more comprehensively than “an online record store.” As far as [Ethans](https:\/\/youtu.be\/inzhStQJFQw) go, Bandcamp’s CEO and founders’ public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it’s quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who’s remained  intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in nuanced forms of verbal communication like… humor. The closest the company has ever come to promotion? His awkward, sub-20-minute [presentation](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MaUkS-lr-ZM) at the XOXO Festival 2014 offered an impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his body language. \r\n\r\n“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company's existence,” he admits. Impressively, Bandcamp was operated entirely as a “virtual company” until 2015.\r\n\r\nEither Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company where the executives are unanimously so fucking fulfilled by their work without exception that they aren’t compelled to leave it long enough to stumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to something like The Internet History Podcast, or technology journalism has definitively lost all reverence for actual innovation in favor of the [emotionally-charged](https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/en-us\/publications\/2018\/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding-amazement-cycle.aspx) Innovation Myth, now [relinquished almost entirely](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/7\/24\/17610348\/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams) to the narrative control of its own protagonists. Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make things happen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they’re turned by the constant distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of the work remaining at the End User’s eye level was abandoned by aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame – only because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.\r\n\r\n“Bandcamp’s philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of the companies we’re surrounded by,” reflects Jervis. “We are not a ‘let’s-raise-money-and-burn-through-it’ type of company.”\r\n\r\nI know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal Brand; I know you’ve read the exact same quote from how many entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout that Jervis speaks without irony or deception.  how many fucking churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it’s actually sincere.\r\n\r\n[RANK & FILE-MOSES SUMNEY](https:\/\/mosessumney.bandcamp.com\/album\/black-in-deep-red-2014) \r\n\r\n## On The Web\r\n\r\nThough Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting” phenomena as it’s washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of my iPhone’s native music app contains the text “Radio” beneath an “antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called [iTunes Radio](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150608143103\/https:\/\/www.apple.com\/itunes\/itunes-radio\/) that was absorbed into – and [restricted to subscribers of](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/1\/15\/10777790\/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28) – Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However, both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” – along with any and all audio streaming services (mentioned and not) – are fundamentally nothing more than different UX design interpretations of the “simple” practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of the century in the form of “[Internet Radio](http:\/\/extratone.com\/library\/internetradiopatent-jozsefkirally.pdf).” Astonishingly, the protocol – still referred to by at least one person on Earth as “Webcasting,” no doubt – has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely encountered it in unusual situations. \r\n\r\nIronically, the [majority](http:\/\/radio.garden\/) of Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations your car’s head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio files over the internet,” though a glance at [Apple’s dated support page](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/PH19478?locale=en_US) for the process suggests it hasn’t crossed anybody’s mind for at least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio network [Voice of America](http:\/\/extratone.com\/library\/voa.pdf) became the “[First [radio\\] on the Internet](http:\/\/www.chriskern.net\/history\/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html)” when it [began](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?hl=en#!original\/rec.radio.shortwave\/2pQ9KUYmLqo\/wqhhXS2k-lAJ) – after [an introduction by Al Gore](http:\/\/extratone.com\/media\/voagore.mp3), no less – “offering digitized audio versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15 languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according to former engineer Chris Kern. However – since we’re already this deep into internet history – a distinction must be established between streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server – in Kern’s original case, “via anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain’t broke. \r\n\r\nSemantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned “purest” form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio. Obscured aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio stations have their own of “[the Internet’s quiet success stories](https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/business\/2007\/04\/09\/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html),” filled with quaint experiences and an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven, anywise.\r\n\r\nOn June 27th, 1999, *The Seattle Times* ran [an especially worthwhile introduction to the concept](http:\/\/community.seattletimes.nwsource.com\/archive\/?date=19990627&slug=2968794) that likely represents the only major newspaper’s mention of SHOUTcast (the first and likely last name in DIY Web DJing) in the history of the printed word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on Mark Mataassa’s part. From the past, one will find his chillingly spot-on foresight and well-considered observations are bestrewed with mind-boggling hilarity when they look.\r\n\r\n>Dialing in to the Net through a 56 kilobit-per-second modem, as I am, this seems like a ridiculous waste - or at least misallocation - of resources.\r\n>\r\n>I'm using a $3,000 machine, tying up a phone line and seriously compromising my computing power for an experience that in sound quality, simplicity and dependability can't compare, truthfully, with the $9 Emerson clock radio an arm's length away.\r\n>\r\n>And yet Web radio is one of the hottest ideas going in the ever-hot world of Internet startups and acquisitions: In the past few months, America Online and Yahoo! each have purchased fast-growing Web music sites, rock-music trendsetters like Rolling Stone and MTV have gotten into the business, and technological improvements - from Microsoft's newest browser and Real Networks' newest player to the latest MP3 enhancements - are closing the quality and accessibility gaps.\r\n>\r\n>The combination of developments is not only changing how computers (and radios) are used, but offering a glimpse of a future when audience demographics are sliced ultra-thin - to the person - and everybody has the potential to be a radio broadcaster as well as listener.\r\n\r\nI only have a few experiences with Internet Radio of my own, but they’re all rampantly more memorable than one would expect. The now in-stasis [NWIRE](https:\/\/twitter.com\/nwireradio) project was by the most relevantly intriguing and [savvily-curated](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/themartmusic\/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017) home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I’ve ever come across – it was my second default browser tab for most of 2017, when I’d even listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just the automated library-perusing bot for hours. On [episode 16 of Drycast](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dry16), I recounted [the absurd tale](https:\/\/clyp.it\/mps4yfyv) of my surprise morning encounter with a Norwegian station’s live broadcast from some European breakcore club, which was likely responsible for the most fun I’ve ever had working in retail. \r\n\r\n[CHATROOM WITH ENYA - ULTRADEMON](https:\/\/ultrademon.bandcamp.com\/track\/chatroom-with-enya)\r\n\r\nMy friend Hawthorn (*Extratone*’s former Tech Editor) is partial to a station called [Radio Swiss Jazz](http:\/\/www.radioswissjazz.ch\/en), which appears to be thriving in comparison with most visible broadcasters, and unapologetically emits a bizarre amalgamation of tunes both chart-topping and Seriously Obscure across every conceivable genre (including Marching Music,) and continent of origin. Between every few charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary mysteries are Internet Radio’s only remaining value for us, and I suspect the same is true for all but the most [laggard laggards](http:\/\/extratone.com\/library\/diffusionofinnovations-everettmrogers.pdf). For as long as I’ve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given library of music and\/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic necessity.\r\n\r\nCrucially, the truly *most* critical consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital streaming experience were centered within intellectual property legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology’s foremost confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of Congress’ Copyright Royalty Board called “[Determination of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting Digital Performance of Sound Recordings](https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/documents\/2016\/05\/02\/2016-09707\/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance)” for *Linux Journal* in an encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled “[Why Are So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air](https:\/\/www.linuxjournal.com\/article\/6218)?” I would hope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that *this was no Cambridge Analytica*: only a few years subsequent the technology’s inception, operators within the Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching *four years* back – the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering this marketplace for the longest time.”\r\n\r\n> Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market relationship isn't with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stop programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a few more clicks they've made a payment.\r\n\r\nBy [March, 2010](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100330102643\/http:\/\/directory.google.com\/Top\/Arts\/Music\/Sound_Files\/MP3\/Streaming\/Stations), just 374 stations were aggregated in Google’s Internet Radio Directory, and my own quick sample from its list unfortunately indicated that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to be abandoned after all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the internet will remain recognizable enough to support it until after we’re all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely ready and accessible should new projects in NWIRE’s vein come along (I know of no better fate I could wish upon the protocol.) From Internet Radio’s pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp’s origin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0.\r\n\r\nAgain, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but the same classic rock-worshiping, upper-middle class, white collar Early Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedly distributing links to something called “Pandora dot com” between AOL and Hotmail inboxes. True luxury music reproduction comes in the form of Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Budding audiophiles and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over their Christmas-gifted studio monitors with WinAmp, which they’ve set up to impeccably “scrobble” their history with every played track to their Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes. (Those who cannot afford to buy the music they intend to add to their libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they’ve sought out a way to obtain it free.) “Streaming” comes from subscription services like Rhapsody (now Napster,) which are [too buried in Digital Rights Management controversy](http:\/\/www.alphr.com\/features\/218559\/the-online-music-rip-off) to feel sustainable. MySpace Music has just begun to fade away – next year, in “the Twitter era,” [SoundCloud will definitively replace it](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2009\/07\/soundcloud-threatens-myspace-as-music-destination-for-twitter-era\/) as the go-to creator network – and Pandora’s immediate future is bright – they’ll make a big move on brand-new mobile streaming experience when they [launch their iPhone OS app](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/photos-hands-on-with-pandoras-internet-radio-iphone-app\/) in July, but the limited performance of the handset’s EDGE network will render it a poor alternative to onsite .mp3s for years to come.\r\n\r\n[YZOME TWEET](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yzome\/status\/1010581123871723520)\r\n\r\nIn January, to minimal acclaim, Oddpost’s Ethan Diamond launched Bandcamp, the startup with programmer friends Joe Holt, Shawn Grunberger, and Neal Tucker to be “a sortof WordPress for musicians” – an easily-created, well-designed landing page to showcase one’s digital music files. As Holt laments in [an interview with ](http:\/\/htmltimes.com\/band-camp.php)*The HTML Times*, creating an online presence for your music had long been “a pain in the ass.” \r\n\r\n“You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.”\r\n\r\nAs an address to all of their shared complaints about the experience of online music distribution up to that point, [early Bandcamp](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090716104620\/http:\/bandcamp.com) was an astounding piece of engineering. The quaint, unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond – who’s more or less remained the singular public face of the company since the very beginning – began a brand tradition of transparently music-nerdy correspondence with his [first post on the Bandcamp blog](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2008\/09\/16\/hello-cleveland\/), explaining the solutions the team had come up with in greater detail.\r\n\r\n> We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.\r\n\r\nThe launch garnered very little attention from tech or music publications of the time, but [Andy Baio’s interview with Diamond](https:\/\/waxy.org\/2008\/09\/bandcamp_launch\/) provides a substantial, technically in-depth picture of just how revolutionary and necessary it was. Most of what has continued to make Bandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning: server-side stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust, easily-embedded Flash player.\r\n\r\n[BANDCAMP'S FIRST SCREENCAST](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/1739268)\r\n\r\nStudy [Diamond’s first](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/1739268)[ ](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/1739268)[“screencast”](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/1739268) alongside a [video tour of SoundCloud](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/1857085) from the period and you’ll notice just how much more functional, future-proofed and *dignified* Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to be caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it’s made perfect sense in the use case of *this one platform*, which knew *exactly* what it was from birth, along with what it would *always* be, apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley’s legends. Ethan first shows the consumer’s experience – none of which has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track purchases – before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, which included playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then, he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn’t find any record of an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely *nothing* of what’s shown in Diamond’s tutorial. In the next few months, they would add [custom page design](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2008\/11\/26\/design-customization\/), [email address capture](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2008\/12\/22\/free-download-email-capture-thingy\/), and [support for custom domains](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2009\/01\/23\/custom-domains-custom-domains\/). By October 2008, they’d made enough waves to be [picked up by ](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/bandcamp-for-cleaner-music-sites\/)*CNET*, for whatever that was worth. Apparently, [Facebook Music](https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2008\/10\/22\/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together\/) was a legitimate property as well, but I do not remember anything about it at all—pondering an alternate reality in which *The* Social Network became the dominant online music streaming platform leads to a bizarre comparison of Neil Diamond and Mark Zuckerberg which I can’t imagine being altogether productive. Suffice it to say, the two founders’ visions differ greatly.\r\n\r\n[HEV - FIVE STAR HOTEL](https:\/\/fivestarhotel.bandcamp.com\/track\/hev)\r\n\r\n## Musicblogocide\r\n\r\nContextually, it’s also important that we dwell for a moment on the legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during Bandcamp’s first formative years, and the federal government’s losing battle to interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the information age. As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to follow up on a *check it out* sort of music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name followed by “.mp3.” If the first go didn’t yield success, even the most rudimentary application of cryptography – like substituting some variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas’ *Illmatic*, for instance – was a sure bet for one’s second try, which would often return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent digital music discoveries were borned, and I’m still convinced that 99% of us participants were completely without malice. I’d argue heartily that music’s brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of peer-to-peer sharing.\r\n\r\n2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of DRM-violating traffic on the *visible* Web, at least. Though it’d be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and Mediafire-embedding, but let’s consider how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about any work of audio that’s ever taken digital form. It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property) [deleted six music blogs](https:\/\/blogger.googleblog.com\/2010\/02\/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html) from its platform in response to complaints about allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. *The Registry* [insisted](https:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2010\/02\/11\/google_musicblogocide_2010\/) the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, itself. \r\n\r\n“It would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of DMCA claims and counterclaims. But you can't blame Google for that,” they concluded, after one of the blog’s founders expressed some of the most personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as [quoted in The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2010\/feb\/11\/google-deletes-music-blogs).\r\n\r\n“It's just sad because we were documenting young people's music from all around the globe. For a lot of people, it was music they wouldn't have been able to discover elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, “blame” is an even more useless avenue of one’s attention than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100% exempt from any consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not the DMCA’s deftness, but that **Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel business incentive before deciding the law applied to them**. It’d be a tad reckless to claim this little act of Google Cruelty to be the beginning of \r\n\r\nFrankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web with a handful of keystrokes – it’d take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they’d need to keep every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they’d ever watch, 100% legally without a single third-party service\/extension interaction, but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It’s easy, but it’s not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationales that’d justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the totally bonkers inclination that any given property\/ies is likely to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access. \r\n\r\nAs Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we’d recognize from the rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. **Today, the coolest and most rabid daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships**, joining [70 million others](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/1\/4\/16850742\/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users) globally as of January. For most, it’s how they prefer to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack – at work, in the car, at school, then at home on the television. For many, it’s how they “explore” new music outside of peer and social recommendations... or, that’s how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify—even after they’ve endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music there—because the real story of its track record as a place to “Discover” new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When 2017’s streaming data began coming in this past January, a popular feature by [Galaxie 500](http:\/\/galaxie500.bandcamp.com\/)’s Damon Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad notoriety—*Pitchfork*—entitled “[How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/oped\/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming\/),” which he began by citing some very alarming statistics.\r\n\r\n“**More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks** [on Spotify.] Which means less than 1 percent of streams account for all other music.” \r\n\r\nWhy? A brazen disregard for necessary meta information, for one.\r\n\r\n“Look now at how badly their applications already serve entire genres of less popular music. Spotify lists recordings by song title, album title, or featured artist name. But that information is so limited it leaves out even the other performers on a recording, a crucial aspect to classical and jazz.”\r\n\r\n![Mitski](http:\/\/bilge.world\/media\/mitski.png)\r\n\r\nAlarming for those of us who intend to create or consume any music separate the Top 40, anyway, which one should feel justified expecting from most people, most of the time. Last month, The Carters released an album on which [even Beyoncé](https:\/\/www.bustle.com\/p\/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616) identified the problematic service by name. “Patiently waiting for my demise ‘cause my success can’t be quantified,” she rapped, “if I gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on Spotify.\" The unfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the industry’s current direction is that its source is adamantly guaranteed a place for her work within Spotify’s top 10 percent for the rest of her career’s lifetime (and probably far beyond.)\r\n\r\n[I could now take the time to complain that she’s also entirely abandoned the city [she owes for her career’s creation](https:\/\/youtu.be\/iiMlq8frlqw) in its darkest hour, but let’s just plan on coming back to the subject at a later date, when we’ll be sure to touch on how terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)]\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish company’s perspective, the digits themselves should’ve been dearly and universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentially ballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they [launched a WordPress blog](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/about-spotify-insights\/) dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing their data called [*Spotify Insights*](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/), proclaiming themselves—naturally—to be “the world’s favorite streaming service,” [championing](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/2017\/11\/02\/listening-diversity-spotify\/) the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyoncé is mentioned only twice upon a [search of its archive](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/?s=beyonce) as it stands today, it’s with fanfare: “[10 Female Artists Women Listen To The Most on Spotify](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/2015\/03\/06\/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most\/)” declared her the third most popular female artist among women, globally, and “Single Ladies” the number one female-streamed track in the world (assuming I’m interpreting its language correctly.)\r\n\r\n[DAGGA - MISS RED](https:\/\/pressurerecords.bandcamp.com\/track\/dagga)\r\n\r\nWe’ve established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the polar opposite end of the business spectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman’s understanding, you’d have your work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both are online marketplaces with gigantic libraries of digital music which a listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Web browser or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively—and they can do from just about anywhere, for as much or as little as they wish. And—as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for the rest of humanity’s reign—both are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a bell—it’s been a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itself has existed.\r\n\r\nThere are those among us who’s adolescent adoration of music is still completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who’ll inevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish intolerability, though it’s become especially easy as of late to forget that DIY recording is by no means a recent development—its financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let’s refer to the pre-dialogue context in [Chuck Klosterman’s GQ interview](http:\/\/extratone.com\/library\/grousesoftheholy-gq.pdf) with “the second- or the third-best rock guitarist of all time”—*Zinc Blimp* legend Jumbo Page.\r\n\r\n> The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a different musician obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a “nerd,\" as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.\r\n\r\nBandcamp’s core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle the “hard part” for creators “so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy,” which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time, SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy” independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to non-existent—by now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of SoundCloud’s Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable we’d ever seen at the time. Over the years, it’s become the most universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.\r\n\r\nWhile I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year, they released [their first earnings report](https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20180502006667\/en\/) in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33 billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion in expected total revenue for 2018. I’ll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile, ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music streaming services – *let’s use this cool new tech to play **music** for **anybody** with a Web browser if only because it’ll be a blast* – yet in that sense, they’ve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.\r\n\r\n“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew—it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014]—we evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,” he explains, partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since. The company's solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative as only theirs could be: an idealized **digital interpretation of a music collection**, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of “[Bandcamp for Fans](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2013\/01\/10\/bandcamp-for-fans\/).” That release notably introduced the ability to “follow” both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on release pages showing customers’ avatars and optional comments, and public wishlists. “I think it’s great to use a streaming service for music Discovery—they can be really really good for that,” Diamond [concedes](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s), before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp’s founding premise that composes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you care about the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly support them.”\r\n\r\nInstead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity feed, “you’ve got a collection of albums and tracks that people were passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and download music files, only—never to stream it—and there’s been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since [July 2010](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2010\/07\/14\/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone\/), actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it’s persisted *to this day*, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating flaw: **multitasking between apps or even browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album**, as will locking the device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then—3G data networks were worse than you remember, anyway—and then in 2013, [the Bandcamp app was launched](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2013\/10\/25\/its-over\/) on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at the time. (I’d rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years, which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting.\r\n\r\nI made a point to spend *a lot* of time engaging with Bandcamp’s service as much as possible – naturally, this included a trip back through [my neglected, digitally dusty Collection](http:\/\/bandcamp.com\/davidblue), which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan’s simple truth didn’t really sink in until I realized that this list is made up exclusively of my *real favorites*, and there’s not a single track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one Blank Banshee album... I was 18, okay?) It’s absurdly powerful—not something I could engage with for any extended time without becoming saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special celebratory episode of [Extratone Radio](http:\/\/extratone.com\/radio) to hear the best music I’ve found through Bandcamp.) It hadn’t occurred to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all music I’ve purchased—including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see—even after an artist chose to delete or hide it on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, of course.)\r\n\r\n[ALONE TIME—INSTUPENDO](https:\/\/instupendo.bandcamp.com\/track\/alone-time)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## The Discovery Debacle\r\n\r\nPursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear foolish – an individual’s music taste is perhaps the most broadly angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American culture, after all – but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of Discovery’s digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to ask you what you believe should be the single most important function that must be reliably performed by any “music Discovery” device – whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit – the single factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant, and\/or completely destroyed, how would you answer? How would you interpret the question? \r\n\r\nIt’s important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one’s taste in film, Americans from Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold “their” music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that propels this phenomena within our culture leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.\r\n\r\n[BIG K.R.I.T.-BIG K.R.I.T.](https:\/\/bigkrit.bandcamp.com\/track\/big-k-r-i-t-explicit)\r\n\r\nAs a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I searched – aided tremendously by my expert best friend – for the edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of “Discovery’s” extremes with fandom: **an obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique**. This process appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it’s important now that I emphasize this confession: I was an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I’ve continued to find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music’s purpose in my life, and I’d anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve cognitive dissonance at great scale. There’s only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers’ Bluetooth connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle while demonically shrieking – eyes rolled back – and lighting various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it’s they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively  breaching a group’s fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you’ve deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future attempts to accomplish **the fundamental drive to share the gospel of music’s variety** out of your own rubish frustration with the differences between you.\r\n\r\nThe real, sweetest truth is that **100% of all music has value potential** because of the medium’s broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our “irony” and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots by scoffing at country music for years, I’ve made a beautiful peace with the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling nostalgia (I’ve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it’s been entirely reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess that I’ve only found true and serene identity through music after learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly, one-of-a-kind superiority of my “taste.”\r\n\r\nThat said, it’s still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance – actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved – only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. **I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture**, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.\r\n\r\nConsider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single  addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. Would you have made out on your first date with someone in your 80s high school Chemistry class after they’d was about \r\n\r\nbut suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. \r\n\r\n“*The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”* \r\n\r\nContrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their *regularity*. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re *trying* to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or *both*. After failing my best attempts to elaborate with historical analogy citing a past event, I’m afraid we must pivot to a science fiction-esque nanonarrative containing obnoxiously speculative hypotheticals, instead.\r\n\r\n**Imagine**: It’s 2036 – four years after we found out we are not alone in the universe when a significantly more advanced civilization makes formal first contact with humanity by sending a party of diplomats, anthropologists, and explorers (who were actually getting ready to go in 2016 before getting word of the Trump presidency and deciding we weren’t quite ready just yet) who land their space egg right in front of the United Nations’ New York City headquarters and expressing something to the tune of *hey so um… we noticed you guys moved in and we just wanted to stop by and say hi*, entirely altering humanity’s self-perception and future trajectory (see: works by Gene Roddenberry) yadda yadda. The visitors expressed a wish to begin a cultural exchange project with us, and it’s just now coming to fruition… I have only moments ago made history in the eyes of the entire world when I walked through the front door of a Target store in suburban New Jersey leading a hovering hyper-intelligent silicon-based sphere of agender mist (roughly comparative to a basketball in size,) who’s already both impressing and shaming me tremendously as we move by the in-store Starbucks. From above us, Semisonic’s “Closing Time” is belched upon my life’s proudest moment and my guest requests we pause to discuss it, to my profound horror.\r\n\r\n“The sound from the reproduction devices embedded above us...” the android translator trails off for a moment. “It is the same noise that was distantly reproduced 51 hours ago in ‘Miami’ as I conversed with Ambassador Phillip Defranco about ‘the setting sun’ on the ‘beach,’ coming from a small open air structure which he defined as ‘a surf shop,’ which was occupied by a young male who appeared to be moderately agitated, moving about in jagged strides as he wildly smacked the foundational surface with ‘a broom.’ The Ambassador explained the youth was likely nearing the end of his allotted period of daily occupational labor.”\r\n\r\nBlood is flooding my cheeks as I listen with a building dread to the robot’s interpretation, awash with all manner of embarrassment for my species. \r\n\r\n“Is the purpose of this noise reproduction of a logistical nature, or is it perhaps a common ritual within business and\/or working class culture?”\r\n\r\n[POSSESSED-RIPSWIRL](https:\/\/ripswirl.bandcamp.com\/track\/possessed)\r\n\r\nNow, it’s your turn to be the human representative in this pico science fiction: you’re now obligated to confirm the alien anthropologist’s hypothesis and explain that “Closing Time” is but one piece of recorded music among billions of diverse expressive works across millennia. You must reverently describe how the “universal language” of math within melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the pop culture conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search for extraterrestrial intelligence from the future-thrilled 90s—S.E.T.I.’s glory days – when we felt pretty damned good about space. The historic launch of the United Nations’ “greetings on behalf of the people of our planet” etched into [The Golden Record](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/09\/30\/554489944\/the-voyager-golden-record-finally-finds-an-earthly-audience) aboard *Voyager I* and Jodie Foster’s novel portrayal of a S.E.T.I. scientist in the iconic Carl Sagan-sourced 1997 science fiction drama *Contact* are among the globally-celebrated Best Hits of humanism (not to mention the organization listed on your paystubs,) and they weigh a billion tons on you, now—in the most significant moment of your entire life, bar none – as you explain on behalf of your species to **real** extraterrestrial intelligence the reality of how negligent it is actually is of the culture the Record claimed to treasure. The worst part, though? The entire experience is accompanied by a nasal-as-hell Semisonic soundtrack.\r\n\r\nAren’t you *frustrated*? You should be, but it’s not over yet: inevitably, your round fictional companion of note is going to follow up their query with some seriously burning meat.\r\n\r\n“Just a half-generation ago, your utopian dream of a globally-connected world – in which everyone would be empowered to saturate and culture themselves with new ideas and forms of expression – was the defining aspiration of your society, and yet you’ve definitively achieved Total Connectivity, now, and caused the overwhelmingly opposite result: you’re all intolerable shitheads who every passing solar orbit become less and less capable of anything but regurgitation of the same foul bullshit. Y’all fucking wack. I’m out. ”\r\n\r\nAnd there, that filthy little ball would have us all. Friends, colleagues, human siblings of mine, **it’s long-past time we expect better from ourselves** as music citizens of the world. Even the longest living of us are endowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is to experience, and we’ve all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds. If it this all seems excessive, there’s no need to feel attacked, but for Pete’s sake… please stop claiming you “like music” because it’s misleadingly inaccurate and I’ll promise never to use the phrase “music citizens of the world” again, in exchange.\r\n\r\n## Distribution & Curation\r\n\r\n**You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit** and we’re going to continue addressing possible causes and solutions to this ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single moved finger on your part because we are fucking saints. Let’s come back to ground and consider a casual real-world use case for a streaming service which I’ve observed.\r\n\r\n> It’s just after 1PM on an especially beautiful Summer day in 2018, and you’ve decided with your two best friends that an impromptu hot dog barbecue in your little apartment’s parking lot would be a great way to spend the afternoon. You get on Facebook Messenger – no time to bother with the formality of creating an event – and begin to bother your group of art school friends. In a few hours, you’ve set up chairs in a circle around the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows, and beer, and your guests have begun to arrive. The next step: retrieve your cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log nearest the scene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?\r\n\r\nLet’s acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in human life—*of course* I realize this—and ultimately, nobody can dictate those fulfilled for another individual by any given track, album, artist, or genre across time and setting. Even splittercore-obsessed serial killers and body modding cybergrind disciples are doomed: inevitably, they will one day let their guard down and find themselves singing along with “Goodbye Earl” on the radio way off key, smiling like a doofus. Even if one hates humanity, they will eventually be forced to acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very close to its penultimate manifestation.\r\n\r\nI understand that it’s not *always* time for something new for everyone, but you’re missing out on music’s most worthwhile function by far if you never seek anything fresh, and—if you still find yourself unwilling to bother, even—carrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal knowledge about *what’s going on* in music with you can be invaluably culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alien intelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or pretentiousness, depending on one’s own subjectives) for music that is far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and\/or patroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point – extreme or not – and you’re at serious risk of being uncool. Nobody wants Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long confusing the Beach Boys with the Beatles – as I have – folks start to behave as if there’s something wrong with you. If it helps, let’s suppose this to be the *real* reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp – perhaps its relative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work justifies it all.\r\n\r\nBy this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as wholly as possible, but the value most in need of its experience has become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The “[Discoverinator](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2012\/06\/07\/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator\/)” (I would’ve voted for calling it “Genre-Fucker”) is simply *the* most ingenious tool available anywhere to filter music by genre, subgenre, location, and medium. Or at least... It’s too gorgeous not to be. Thanks to its recent visual redesign, I don’t even care if it’s useful—it’s just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Web and the iOS app (though I’d bet they were each crafted separately.)\r\n\r\n[BANDCAMP DEMO VIDEO](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SOaEAR9Da70)\r\n\r\nFront and center on the homepage is the [Bandcamp Daily](http:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/) – a showcase of features, lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various staff and guest contributors which I’d most certainly judge befit of a standalone publication – and the [Bandcamp Weekly](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?show) – an extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes, guest appearances, and commentary which the company’s [Chief ](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/andrewjervis)[Curator Andrew Jervis](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/andrewjervis) has been honing [since 2013](http:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?show=1) over 289 episodes as of [this morning](http:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?show=289). Its player functions both in-browser and on the iOS app unlike any I’ve ever seen, with a list of embedded tracks that pop out when they’re actually spinning on the show so that you can engage further with them, if you wish. It’s difficult to describe, but it feels visually like you’re listening to a playlist in Bandcamp’s normal player, except tracks are intermixed and faded between one another beneath the host’s commentary, so the audio itself must be pre-rendered. Regardless, it’s nearly as extraordinary an achievement in Web design as the program itself is in curatorial music broadcasting. I’m no addict to the genre, but I have yet to Discover another similar product which I can binge episode after episode for hours without becoming bored or irritated as I can the *Bandcamp Weekly*’s.\r\n\r\nTo fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests—how viable is Bandcamp? Truthfully, it’s only slightly more suited now than it was in its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space with ambiance. We could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback only consequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower of hipster elitism on which you’ll occasionally hear it accused of perching, but UX design is *the* most ridiculous sphere within which to intenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless grace of a thousand moons, *Medium,*) so lets hold off to seek out an interview with a Bandcamp representative.\r\n\r\nSoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark—it can be configured to simply *keep going* after you’ve finished a track, regardless of where you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, of course)—but it’d be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time required to find a manmade playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free [YouTube Music service](https:\/\/djmag.com\/content\/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services) has a lot of potential, in theory, but we’re *outside* in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.\r\n\r\nStartlingly, the Web’s given best answer to this situation is still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. *Internet radio*? Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but they’re usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won’t last you more than a few hours before you’ll start to hear repeats. You could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station—a *student* radio station, even—but those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer afternoon. So—forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% and everything else for a moment—why not just give up the pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes especially dire—necessary, really—when I queue up “Cannibal Ox Radio” for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but **how about an option to filter out white rappers**? (I hope you didn’t blink because that’s by far my best contribution in tech writing yet.)\r\n\r\n[LEGENDARY IRON HOOD-OPEN MIC EAGLE](https:\/\/openmikeeagle360.bandcamp.com\/track\/legendary-iron-hood)\r\n\r\nThe truth is, I’d probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I’ve been an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is [reportedly still nearly ](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/05\/06\/apple-music-vs-spotify\/)[25% larger](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/05\/06\/apple-music-vs-spotify\/), its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS (which hasn’t always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I *did* know somebody else who used it, they’d be able to see [my public profile](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbapple) including my playlists and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify’s endless adaptive playlists, but—crucially, for myself—after the app’s redesign for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I’ve selected the option to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes the distinction between “my” music and the music I’ve paid for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks a month for “ownership” of *all* the music on iTunes proper.\r\n\r\nWhile I might personally play Bandcamp Weekly episodes in such a context and gladly accept whatever results I’d get, I’d only do so acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck I’ve never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery—the practice in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which continues to prove itself to better deserve the term “automated wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”\r\n\r\n[FIGHT OR FLIGHT (PROBLEM CHILD) - SMITH COMMA JOHN](https:\/\/smithcommajohn.bandcamp.com\/track\/fight-or-flight-problem-child)\r\n\r\nIronically, Damon Krukowski’s aforementioned “responsibility” essay on *Pitchfork* openly cites Liz Pelly’s burning-hot and [100%](https:\/\/thebaffler.com\/salvos\/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly)[ essential analysis](https:\/\/thebaffler.com\/salvos\/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly) of algorithmically-generated playlists for *The Baffler* notes the publication’s own substantial relationship with Spotify, including a [Webby Award-winning](https:\/\/www.webbyawards.com\/winners\/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery\/) advertorial series called *Inside Discovery*, which the two collaborate to produce that’s “meant to boost awareness of the ‘Discover Weekly’ feature.”\r\n\r\n> The series shows *Pitchfork* editors (and favored musicians) gushing about their love of streaming—the immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for “the most trusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as preferable to its own crate digging? What does it mean when the tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithms become cool? Virtually every music publication now relies on Spotify media players to embed songs within online articles, and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate their playlists with listicles: “Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.”\r\n\r\nWe love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring *Inside Discovery*’s (surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of *I wish business just incentived building nice things* disappointment which has become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to immediately land on [Mitski’s ](https:\/\/insidediscovery.pitchfork.com\/playlist-mitski)[playlist](https:\/\/insidediscovery.pitchfork.com\/playlist-mitski), to whom I’d just been [reintroduced](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/profile\/dont-cry-for-mitski\/) (by *Pitchfork*, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized, admittedly, by *Pitchfork*.)\r\n\r\nUpon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why wouldn’t it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so desperately cheap? I’d wager heavily that there’s at least a single editor within Apple Music who’s spent serious time embedded in the Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime “Techno” playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.\r\n\r\n“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we’re encouraged to develop a taste profile and stick to it,”  [opines somebody on *Pigeons & Planes](https:\/\/pigeonsandplanes.com\/in-depth\/2016\/03\/music-discovery-algorithms),* complimenting Pelly in their profile of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and his new job curating an Apple Music playlist?  \r\n\r\nThe truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty, Y2K-lookin’-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how Mark Zuckerberg’s horny social ineptitude led to Facebook’s conception, but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share – the whole present-day reading world and I, that is – of dwelling entirely too much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution. Bandcamp’s story is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined in contrast, I’m afraid, with all that’s being done *wrong* everywhere else.\r\n\r\n> Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly wanting to conform to a kind of Bandcamp aesthetic? I don’t think so. Not yet. But if that does happen, something might be lost — a sense of these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp promise in the first place. People can use help navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens an interesting question: When does help turn into tastemaking?\r\n\r\n## The Creators\r\n\r\nYou missed it, didn’t you—the ten-year anniversary of Bandcamp’s launch? Ashamed, I realized last month that I did, too. Ashamed, because I owe a lot to to the platform’s unwavering commitment to the distribution and curation of work made by just about all of my favorite artists—within and outside of my social network. Throughout 2015, I hosted a number of conversations with exceptional, future-looking creators on *Drycast* which I am especially proud of. On one [early episode](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dry16) with an exceptional total of *seven* music makers, I observed in a beat that “all of us have Bandcamp accounts,” before the week’s guest, Samantha Carter, suggested that she’d found her page especially financially rewarding, and originated the concept of the “Bandcamp Sugar Daddy” (which I personally ship 100%.)\r\n\r\n[EXTRATONE RADIO EMBED](http:\/\/bit.ly\/extrproducers)\r\n\r\n“It's something I take for granted,” said my friend [yzome](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yzome) – a [truly one-of-a-kind electronic producer](https:\/\/yzome.bandcamp.com\/) who’s far-traveling composition is probably the closest Digital Audio Workstation equivalent of Extreme Use Testing—when automotive manufacturers effectively torture new prototypes with the most inhospitable conditions on Earth until they break. However, it’s not a PR stunt in yzome’s case—he’s just very good at doing what he does after doing it for nearly 10 years—and his end product requires a hell of a lot more than any one genre would ever presume, but it more than delivers back on the investment with significant interest.\r\n\r\nWhen [he appeared on ](http:\/\/bit.ly\/drycast9)*Drycast* in January 2015, we failed to achieve any descriptors more sophisticated than “alien sounds,” but perhaps that’s all they need: the inner worlds into which yzome invites us are of manic, unpredictable arrhythmia which poses an unapologetic, yet magically lighthearted challenge to any cohesive theory. It’s very rare that his proudly-ungenreable exploration of the fringes does not demand the listener’s full attention, yet it always manages to be *inoffensively aggressive* like **nothing** else, which suggesting promise for the possible upheaval of a long-upheld natural law among electronic dance music: yzome doesn’t need to be a shithead to challenge the listener intellectually\r\n\r\n[WORM - YZOME](https:\/\/yzome.bandcamp.com\/track\/worm)\r\n\r\nPlay *YVETTE* for any boomer you know with that classically impenetrable disgust for *all* electronic music, and you’ll witness firsthand how special yzome’s particular innovation truly is. No, they’re not going to be *sexually liberated*, or anything—it’s still going to be alarming—but you’ll notice that the swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy dance music has always awoken within them has been miraculously circumvented. Instead of immediately storming off, they’ll be paralyzed in an existential fugue state from which they may never quite fully emerge. I’ve seen it firsthand. It’s witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThere is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum who can so loudly go so far, so fast without any insincerity, whatsoever. His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the place, but really listen and you’ll hear rips of recognizable patterns playing peekaboo in willy-nilly bursts that reveal his dynamic mastery of the dance music space through Breakcore, Juke, Footwork, and Techno sampling. All of this is to say, really, that yzome’s music represents a level of boundary-pushing which only a niche audience tends to truly appreciate, yet is undoubtedly worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp.\r\n\r\n\"Like thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this. It's seen as a legitimate platform (by people who might actually care about what I’m doing, at least,) which I think is less offputting than uploading things to Mediafire or whatever else. It’s populist and boutique at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n***Populist, yet boutique***. Can we really be expected to exceed this summation? Well, nobody’s said much at all in the mainstream press, but what *has* been said is 1) unusually misplaced in the spaces of those least likely to find it relevant and 2) *way* more insightful than you’d expect. \r\n\r\n“Bandcamp has an independent-artist identity because of practicalities: Independent artists from Web-centered subcultures need it most,” observed an especially savvy online aside from by [Ben Ratliff](http:\/\/benratliff.net\/)—jazz and pop critic for *The New York Times—*asking “[Is](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/08\/20\/arts\/music\/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html)[ Bandcamp the Holy Grail of Online Record Stores](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/08\/20\/arts\/music\/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html)?” So why aren’t we talking about it? The other important takeaway: founder Neil Diamond told Ratliff that “the company has never spent money on promotion.” This is largely why I’ve invested so much time and affection into this piece—gratitude is not often sellable incentive for mainstream coverage. \r\n\r\nThe truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp’s story despite all it’s done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in fact, it would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or even to its prevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom I will address in detail shortly,) but because it simply operates too magnanimously for its customers to be taken seriously as a newsworthy business, which is problematic and personally infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made mention in *The New Yorker* via the openly diminutive context of *Car Seat Headrest’s* [origin story](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2015\/11\/02\/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu), describing it as “a charming alternative,” and “a casual, low-risk approach.” Granted, it’s worth noting that the platform did not address its lack of “editorial guidance” until a year later, with the [launch](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2016\/06\/13\/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily\/) of the excellent *Bandcamp Daily* blog, but I think you’ll agree it’s in poor taste to argue against the legitimacy of a *music* distribution platform because it’s *too democratic.* Perhaps it’s still just beyond reasonable expectations to get a top-of-the-foodchain music writer’s head wrapped around the idea that such products on The Internet can easily—even optimally—service both hobbyists and professionals.\r\n\r\nLast year, Bandcamp was responsible for [$270 million in payments](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2018\/02\/12\/the-bandcamp-2017-year-in-review\/) to artists like Jlin,the genius commonly associated with Footwork (certainly Chicago’s most underreported and popularly underrepresented movement,) for pushing its expressive boundaries both in theory and geography further than any other, and who’s so far produced two of the most “[aggressively](https:\/\/noisey.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/qvv37m\/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)[ beautiful](https:\/\/noisey.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/qvv37m\/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)” records you’ll find anywhere in the process.[[i\\]](#_edn1) Type her name into any search engine and her Bandcamp page is *always* the first result, yet Cntrl-Fing for “Bandcamp” will yield 0 results from her interviews with *The Fader*, *FACT Magazine*, *Pitchfork*, *The Seventh Hex*, *Passion of the Weiss*, *PopMatters*, *Crack Magazine*, *DUMMY*, *The Guardian*, *The Quietus*, *BOMB Magazine*, *Ableton Blog*, *The Creative Independent*, *Rolling Stone*, *SPIN*, *No Fear of Pop*, *self-titled magazine*, *Circulation Magazine*, *The New Yorker*, *Cyclic Defrost*, *Mixmag*, or *melting bot*, and only one in *Interview Magazine*. To be clear: I am **not** arguing that Jlin—a black female music artist—should be profusely thanking Bandcamp—a service founded largely by white male programmers—for hosting her most visible page but rather that the more independent of these publications, especially, should mention its role in her story or—at the very least—be hyperlinking to [her Bandcamp page](https:\/\/jlin.bandcamp.com\/) first, for both her’s and their readers’ sake—Bandcamp’s cut of album purchases is half of iTunes. From the user experience perspective, it’s absurd that those of these pages including embedded music players chose to use SoundCloud’s—which is more resource heavy (yet of noticeably lesser streaming playback quality) and visually disruptive—instead of [Bandcamp’s](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2013\/06\/12\/all-new-players-up-twitter-too\/).\r\n\r\n[BLACK ORIGAMI (ALBUM) - JLIN](https:\/\/jlin.bandcamp.com\/album\/black-origami)\r\n\r\nThe two services were launched the same year—that fateful 2008—but comparing them is complicated. They are clear opposites in at least one principal: how they’ve defined their mission. Bandcamp has changed less throughout its history than any other Web service that comes to mind (see below,) but SoundCloud has struggled with identity issues, to their vastly-superior success (in terms of user statistics, anyway.) *The New York Times* [reported in June, 2011](https:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/06\/15\/soundcloud-an-audio-sharing-site-hits-5-million-users\/) that they’d reached 5 million users, citing their decision to expand focus beyond “popular music” to explain the milestone. “We’re building a sound platform that’s not just about music,” said Alex Ljung – a SoundCloud co-founder and the company’s chief executive at the time – and its present landscape certainly reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any . Today, both SoundCloud and Bandcamp have premium subscription plans for artists which are at least *perceived* to be competitive with one another—[SoundCloud Pro](https:\/\/blog.soundcloud.com\/2013\/03\/11\/introducing-soundcloud-pro\/) and [Bandcamp Pro](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2012\/06\/25\/new-features-up\/), respectively—along with free base experiences, which we’ll compare first.\r\n\r\n#### Free Bandcamp Account\r\n**Uploads**: quantity unlimited, size of each file limited to 291mb.\r\n**Distribution**: unlimited streaming, up to 200 free downloads per month.\r\n\r\n#### Free SoundCloud Account\r\n\r\n**Uploads**: total of 3 hours uploaded at any given time.\r\n**Distribution**: unlimited streaming, unlimited downloads.\r\n\r\nBoth offer access “basic” statistics for their tracks at this tier which most of the creators I know consider more than enough—the usefulness of any playback\/download stats is negligible when you’re publishing within tight niches—and each has had about 5 years to fine-tune their free offerings so that they feel as complete as possible. If you’re planning on publishing a podcast on SoundCloud, you’re obviously going to have to upgrade your upload limit even beyond Pro ($8\/month, 6-hour upload limit) to Pro Unlimited ($16\/month, unlimited uploads,) though I would suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you got that far. Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account. While [there ](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover)*are* [podcasts on Bandcamp](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover), they’re completely separate the platform’s aspirations and without support for the basic requirements of podcast distribution (namely, RSS feeds.)\r\n\r\nBandcamp’s Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain, batch file uploading, private streaming (for press and\/or fans) plus the ability to disable *free* streaming (requiring listeners to actually buy the music to enable any playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody uses, to my knowledge,) extended fan interaction tools, and a broader statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support. SoundCloud’s Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but a full-time independent artist could justify maintaining Pro accounts on both services or neither—one does not necessarily replace the other, but the contrast in their chosen presentations has led to a divide in the cultures of the two communities so stark [it could be a punchline](http:\/\/www.thefader.com\/2017\/04\/03\/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists-meme) and\/or simplified to say that *SoundCloud is for rap* and *Bandcamp is not*.\r\n\r\nIt’s not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud’s story has been more present in the greater conversation than Bandcamp’s. Frankly, its largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud, **Bandcamp’s community is White As Fuck** (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own observations and those which a select few creators have seen fit to express to me over the years, considering that the company has yet to release any demographic information about its creators) which is a glaringly fundamental obstruction to the project’s broader mission to help music culture “[thrive](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/about).”\r\n\r\nFrom a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud *earned* his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to [give new meaning](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/pitchfork\/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper) to the phrase “serially likable.” Thus far, his mythical power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtight  Last year, his second album *Coloring Book* made history when it won the [first streaming-only ](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2017\/02\/12\/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy\/)[Grammy for Best Album](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2017\/02\/12\/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy\/). In my personal favorite moment in recent popular culture memory, the fashionable-as-hell young man [accepted the accolade](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FkAJ_BU66Zs) by looking the whole industry establishment in the face and proclaiming “this is for every indie artist—everybody who’s been doin’ this mixtape shhhh...*tuff* for a long ass time... shouts out to every independent artist out there; [shouts out to SoundCloud for holding me down](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/2\/12\/14594672\/chance-the-rapper-grammy-awards-2017-soundcloud).” Obviously, such significant, sentimental, and sincere sentiments are *never* expressed about tech companies by beloved darlings of the art world like Chance—especially not for Earth-encompassing awards show audiences.\r\n\r\nAfter [last year’s massive layoff](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/7\/6\/15928674\/soundcloud-cuts-40-percent-staff), it was [Chance’s assurances](https:\/\/twitter.com\/chancetherapper\/status\/885921220759355397) that “SoundCloud is here to stay” which the public took to heart. Even if the company *is* destined to fail within the next year (it appears to be as yet missing much of a verdict,) and it’s all still destined to fold at any moment, at least it’ll have the distinct pride of doing so having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and confidence, which is a damned fine legacy in my book. Meanwhile, Bandcamp has only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure, and added new features very deliberately, which haven’t resulted in a single memorable controversy. Aside from [Amanda Palmer](https:\/\/www.pastemagazine.com\/articles\/2010\/07\/amanda-palmer-sells-15k-on-bandcampin-three-minute.html), perhaps, there has never been a single band or artist who’ve been known as “from Bandcamp,” leaving our only pitch to be something like *Independent Online Music Platform on Track to Complete 10th Year Serving Small-Time Artists, Continues to Look Pretty Good*.\r\n\r\n[EVERY FAT BEE IS MY GIRLFRIEND - SOPHIAAAAHJKL;8901](https:\/\/hjkl-8901.bandcamp.com\/track\/every-fat-bee-is-my-girlfriend-2) \r\n\r\n![Startup Ethan Yelling](http:\/\/bilge.world\/media\/startupyelling.png)\r\n\r\nConsidering the significance of these contributions, it’s of a special wonder that they were made not by a non-profit organization, academic movement, or government endowment, but by a for-profit, California-based tech company that’s continued to thrive and innovate great content, entirely apart from mainstream coverage.\r\n\r\n[GRAY ICE - FRIENDZONE](https:\/\/friendzone.bandcamp.com\/track\/gray-ice)\r\n\r\n## The Future\r\n\r\nIt might seem a bit much on the surface, but in many ways, Bandcamp has spent the past 10 years showing us what a for-profit, Web-based, culturally-edging independent platform Can be, even in the Valley.\r\n\r\nThough Bandcamp has embarked upon unusually sparse explanation of its editorial directive in the *Daily* blog and *Weekly* podcast, but regularly consume either for any length of time, and you’ll notice a particular savvy for Discovering technically-progressive Afrocentric projects: “[Black Experimental Music](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2016\/08\/05\/a-guide-to-black-experimental-music\/),”\r\n\r\nOn [last week’s episode](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/07\/19\/podcasts\/still-processing-tin-house-inclusion-hannah-gadsby.html) of the excellent *New York Times* podcast *Still Processing*, co-host Jena Wortham “I’m thinking a lot about ways in which new culture, new cultural products, new cultural creators come to light in ways that sidestep these traditional means and don’t have to go through the traditionally very white, very male, very cis, very hetero hoops to prove worthiness.”\r\n\r\nSo, our greatest hope for the decentralization of the music industry in the 1990s ended up transforming before us to become the most effectively divisive Discovery barrier ever known to man because of its psychological influence sub-threshold at unprecedented scale over time, in parallel with so many other like horrific monstrosities we’ve discovered in anguish to be mutants of those final salvations from our atrocious history which we’d been so relieved to believe in. Surely, the turn of the millennia was destined to be our final turning point – the moment we’d finally use our new technology to discover a truth (or maybe just a really good clue,) that’d immediately unite our species in a deafening, worldwide aha moment when it would reveal a general abstract of whatever the fuck our deal was that was preventing our silent, dutiful, and 100% harmonious collective effort toward a utopia like Star Trek: The Next Generation’s, in which anyone is absolutely free of obligation or desperation from birth to pursue… whatever with their time.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Test footnotes.",
