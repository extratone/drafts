## Bio

The author, on a good day.

Matt Gemmell<sup id="fnref:pronunciation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://mattgemmell.com/about/#fn:pronunciation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is a writer of thriller, horror, and suspense novels. He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland with his wife Lauren, their son Calum, and the world’s most handsome labradoodle, Whisky. You can [find out about his books here](https://mattgemmell.com/books/).

He developed a fascination with fiction as a young boy, and first tried his hand at writing [stories of his own](https://mattgemmell.com/my-stories/) in his early teens. Writing fell by the wayside for a while, and Matt got a degree in Computing Science then had a successful career as a software engineer, including design and user experience consultancy for companies like Apple. He also released software of his own, and [contributed significantly](https://github.com/mattgemmell/) to the open source community.

Whisky, *without* an 'e'.

Life rolled on, including marriage to Lauren, his university sweetheart, and in the opening days of 2014, Matt decided to [make some changes](https://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/) and try pursuing novel-writing in earnest. The [KESTREL techno-thrillers series](https://mattgemmell.com/books/kestrel/) was born, with many other stories besides, and the journey continues.

Matt is also the author of the *Once Upon A Time* collections of ultra-short tales, including [ebooks and paperback anthologies](https://mattgemmell.com/books/once-upon-a-time/), and a continuing [series of standalone stories](https://mattgemmell.com/books/once-upon-a-time/stories/) which you can [receive free via email every week](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/n2d2u9).
