<h4>Will Twitter Blue subscribers receive preference when receiving account support?</h4>

<p>Our goals include providing the best customer support in our industry. We’re committed to treating everyone fairly and equitably. The Twitter rules won’t apply differently to subscribers, and they won’t get faster service on issues like content moderation.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Will Twitter Blue subscribers receive different support for enforcement issues like account blocks?</h4>

<p>We are committed to making Twitter a safe place for everyone to participate in the public conversation. That’s why policy enforcement issues and reports by subscribers will continue to be handled by existing enforcement teams, under the current review process.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>Is Twitter Blue ad-free?</h4>

<p>No. Currently, ads continue to fund our ability to innovate as we grow this new part of our business. Twitter Blue does include an Ad-free Articles feature which offers subscribers a fast-loading, ad-free reading experience on the websites of publishers within the Twitter Blue Publisher Network. Read more about our <a href="/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles.html">Ad-free Articles</a> feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Is dedicated support a premium feature of Twitter Blue?</h4>

<p>Twitter Blue subscribers receive dedicated support for subscription-specific issues. That could look like help with managing a subscription, how to access your account or settings, and enrollment issues. Other issues could include troubleshooting special features only available to subscribers.</p>

<h1><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22771079/apple-macos-monteray-ios-15-mac-iphone-software-operating-system-updates-space-out-features">Apple should take a break from annual iOS and macOS updates - The Verge</a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about.</p>

<li>Mark As Seen</li>
<li>Get Artists</li>
