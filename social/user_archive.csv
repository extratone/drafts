Does keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet exists?,Drafts for Mac,No,"Of the many things I have to thank you for (that I’ve been experimenting with lately,) this is the most significant, but for reasons not entirely related to just Drafts. Without being too wordy:

I’ve been using a bluetooth keyboard with my iPhone since it was introduced with iPhone 4. (It began as a conscious experiment - I chose a new phone instead of a new laptop to take to my first year of college.) 

I have accumulated a lot of evidence to suggest that number of *iPhone* users who’ve used a hardware keyboard with their phone is *extremely* tiny, but I think it’s a dynamic that’s still worth documenting properly. As you’ve probably observed, even the association of iPad and keyboard in the past few years has actually made it worse - lookup any given iOS app’s keyboard shortcuts and you’ll return a list *for iPad* and nothing else. Over the years, I’ve maintained a habit of going down the iPad list, testing each shortcut on iPhone, noting down the results in a table, and then emailing said list to the developers. (Naturally, they almost never respond. Shout out to Tapbots for being the only recent exception.)

Basically, I have come to the conclusion that the responsibility of writing the definitive **iPhone x Bluetooth Keyboard** guide/reference/documentation is my own. 

I'm posting this response here because I want to invte past, present, and future users to please share any thoughts they have on this if they so desire, but I'd very much like to consult you privately if you can spare the time and energy.

Does keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet exists?,Drafts for Mac,No,"> from a developer perspective I would think it would be harder to make them not work on iPhone than to just let them be the same.

Thank you for confirming that! I've always suspected, but I am ultimately not a developer. 

the answer to your question, in my experience, is **yes**…

I would go so far as to say the _majority_ of the cross-platform apps which have bluetooth keyboard support have incongruities between the devices.

Depending on how much you know about Tweetbot 6, you might find it interesting to know that its two remaining essential shortcuts (F to favorite a Tweet and ⌘ + R to reply) are no longer supported, though there was a point where I had both Tweetbot 5 and Tweetbot 6 on my phone when those shortcuts were still working on the former. As I said, they did actually respond to me about this! First with doubt:

> Which ones do you think you are missing, don't think that should've changed.

Then - in the interest of thoroughness - I did one more systematic run through of Tweetbot’s iPad shortcuts list just to make sure, sent the results to them, and heard back a week later: “thanks! we’ll take a look at these.”

I consider myself pretty competent at finding documentation on any given obscure, dated issue, but never with proprietary Apple stuff before lol.

I would kill for an actual look at the code involved - I’ve been seriously considering buying a used Mac Mini just so I could poke around Xcode myself.",0,2,https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/does-keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet-exists/8503/15,2021-04-03T19:56:29.921Z
"iOS Shortcut ""Run Action with Text"" (magic variable?)",Actions - Help & Questions,No,"[quote=""agiletortoise, post:10, topic:7319""]
There are many ways to get a result back to Shortcuts. The Drafts action could put text in the cllpboard, as @sylumer mentioned, but also write to files, or store results in a draft which could be fetched. Lots of options.

This is definitely *the* place to start, but Drafts is incredibly unique on iOS in that you can pretty much customize keyboard shortcuts entirely, by way of custom shortcuts *per Action*.

Index by Tag with Drafts Open Links via Siri Shortcuts,Tips & Tricks,No,"Howdy folks. I’ve published a few Drafts-specific Siri Shortcuts [on RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/user/blue) over the (now) years, but I’ve come to realize that one in particular - called [**List .md Drafts Open Links by Tag**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11085) - might provide a function not so easily serviced by native actions, especially on iOS. I think I’ve also unintentionally stumbled upon the fastest method by far of simply listing all drafts by a single tag *aside from a dedicated workspace* configured to do so.

The end result looks like this - an unordered markdown list of every draft in a tag specified at run, including a markdown-formatted hyperlink of each draft’s draft open link:

![Shortcuts Tag Index](upload://iIVUYvpqWZyYTThuvZGVjxdngp6.png)

## Steps 

1. An [Ask for Input](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/ask-for-input/) action prompts for the case-sensitive name of the tag you’d like to index.
2. A [Search Drafts](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts#search-drafts) action retrieves up to 100 drafts (by default) with that tag, sorted (by default) by modified date. Obviously, every option in this action is configurable to your needs.
3. For each draft result, an item is created in the format `- [Title](Open Link)`.
4. A [Combine Text](https://www.matthewcassinelli.com/actions/combine-text/) action combines the resulting items with new lines.
5. A [Create Draft](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts#create-draft) action creates a new draft with the formatted list entitled `[tag] - [timestamp]`.

I hope you all give it a try at least once just to experience how little time the whole cycle takes. Remember that drafts open links work anywhere a hyperlink works, not just in Drafts. 

I’ve personally found [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191) to be a particularly apt place for this, seen here:

I have too many drafts to handle!,General Discussion,No,"To be honest, brilliantly! In so many different ways! It’s one of the reasons I love/depend on Drafts so much - it’s the only space in which I feel completely free to create as many or as few separate notes/“files” as I need without consequence.

I have too many drafts to handle!,General Discussion,No,"Well shucks! For one thing, I’m flattered, @FlohGro  that someone of your familiarity/potency with Drafts would be curious about my setup hehe. I’ve been writing a lot about Drafts recently, but something as straight up as “How I Manage Drafts” sounds like something I should start right now! 

As of this moment, there’s quite a bit of raw evidence of my configuration available publicly on the web. [davidblue.wtf/drafts](https://davidblue.wtf/drafts) is the main index of an experiment I’ve been doing using [my NeoCities actions](https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities). If you’re *really* curious and want to spend the time, most of my total setup is on the directory, just unlisted - you can find my best attempt at indexing its links on [my Drafts-specific GitHub repo](https://github.com/extratone/drafts).

And then there’s [this WIP draft](https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/56EED87E-678E-4248-8E94-31650615C69A.html) of a thing I’ve been working on for a while but you must keep it a secret...

Represent Nothing (null) in Actions,Actions - Help & Questions,No,"I've come to love and depend upon my [Clear Clipboard action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vP) as *the* single simplest/quickest way to clear my iPhone's system clipboard with a paired keyboard shortcut. It uses a single, empty clipboard action. Since either 32.0 or 32.1, however, it appears that empty templates are now automatically filled with `[[draft]]`. As you can imagine, this managed to confuse the heck out of me for an embarrassingly long time before I realized what was happening.

I appreciate looking out but - if I may - I think this change has major potential to cause confusion for others as well. My case is unusual, I'm sure, but I would imagine empty actions are something folks use regularly in action development.

And as far as I can tell... All the ways of doing this in JavaScript are overcomplicated, and unfortunately, `app.setClipboard()` returns ""undefined.""",0,0,https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/represent-nothing-null-in-actions/12745/1,2022-05-24T00:41:16.130Z

Question regarding TADpooLe,Actions - Help & Questions,No,"For one thing, I just want to say that this is 110% a legitimate, reasonable, and constructive question to ask here! I can't speak for Stephen, but - as a relatively longtime user of his library - I think I might have some worthwhile touchpoints depending on how long you've used Drafts, itself.

I know you sorta mentioned it, but one great comfort you can take regarding privacy in Drafts is that - basically without exception - actions with external integration have to [ask you for credentials](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/credentials) before they can do anything via a very specific type of dialog, and you can always see a list of said credentials (the titles, anyway) in Settings (Gear Menu) ⇨ Credentials (It's the sole entry under the ""Services"" subgroup.) You'll find that you can revoke any of them at any time if you feel unclear about what's happening.

As far as auditing is concerned, Drafts' native [Action Log](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/action-log) is very dependable *as long as you make sure the actions you're using aren't explicitly configured not to log*. If you've got the time, the TAD library actually includes some very impressive ""[Advanced Logging](https://www.thoughtasylum.com/2020/07/25/drafts-advanced-logging/)"" capabilities - though I must admit I'm basically just getting started with them, personally.

I know my commentary was not solicited but my logline for Drafts when speaking about it for the first time is specifically ""I *trust* Drafts more deeply than any other software I've ever used."" Perhaps the biggest contributor to that is how well documented it is. (Remarkably, [the TAD Library](https://tadpole.thoughtasylum.com) is, as well.) The second is how patient and open Greg and this very community have been with me. (I *promise* you I've asked far, *far* less appropriate questions here and gotten away with it lol.)

That said, welcome! I hope that was at least somewhat useful lol.",0,0,https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/question-regarding-tadpoole/12991/2,2022-07-14T17:16:11.325Z
