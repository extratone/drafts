hey folks, this is going to sound confrontational-ish, but I promise it isn't... nor is it a convince me why to use Obsidian post... but I've been wanting to bring it up for a while and I've thought about it enough to think it might actually be insightful.

I've been around Obsidian for the course (as in... years?... though I swear it looked nothing like it does now, originally,) and played with it a bit, but having really gone into Drafts pretty hardcore this year, there's something about this description by (either john or federico - sorry I don't remember who) from an issue of macstories several weeks ago:

> At its core, Obsidian is a Markdown text editor. Just point the app to a folder on your iPhone or iPad and you're ready to get started. The app is based on web technologies, which means it is highly customizable. Obsidian supports a theming system, with a wide variety of themes provided by the app's vibrant community of users and plugins to extend the app's functionality. The app's primary views are its editor and preview mode, which can be split into multiple panes both vertically and horizontally. Obsidian also supports saved workspaces that allow users to open a predefined group of notes easily, commands for quickly opening documents and accessing the app's features, along with extensive, customizable keyboard shortcut support. Of course, notes can be linked internally, allowing for the creation of a wiki-like web of documents.

Aside from "web technologies," this is a description of Drafts basically word-for-word. Or at least... My current Drafts setup, which isn't all that extraordinary.

Having found out yesterday that the most extreme of my bluetooth-iphone friends is also all-in on Obsidian... And notably frustrated with Drafts for a reason I can't quite understand, I guess I'm looking at these apps on my iPhone and wondering... why? if that makes sense.
