<h2>One livestreaming app has always been a fascinating, generally positive, and all around beautiful place.</h2>

<p>In April, <em>The Outline</em> - one of my favorite Web Sites ever - <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/">closed its virtual doors</a>. I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called &#8220;<a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8423/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website">A Good Place</a>,&#8221; which began with the tag &#8220;the internet is too much, but this place is just right.&#8221; In general, it sought the more wholesome, &#8220;positive&#8221; bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet <em>mainstream</em> for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3">Twitter bought before its independent launch</a> that&#8217;s quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1069117482647076865</p>

<p>Through this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I&#8217;ve spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn&#8217;t understand each other whatsoever. I&#8217;ve streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance. Periscope is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">embedded more deeply in society</a> than one would think, considering how little it&#8217;s mentioned in media.</p>

<p>In February 2014, <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz">Kayvon Beykpour</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/joebernstein">Joe Bernstein</a> founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors &#8220;including Adobe executive Scott Belsky.&#8221; A year later, Twitter <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3">bought it for some $50&#8211;100 million</a> (not even <em>Business Insider</em> knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">Meerkat</a> - the since-extinct <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/the-inevitable-democratization/">arguably originating</a> service in the space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By building a <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter</a>‘s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that “just works.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37555100">died</a> at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. &#8220;The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw">surprise emergence of Meerkat</a> as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them,&#8221; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat">reported Casey Newton for <em>The Verge</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Periscope, by contrast, maintains an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/9/11635382/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji">archive of past broadcasts</a> for a significant period and allows users to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/save-broadcast">save broadcasts locally</a> on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. <a href="https://qz.com/365293/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding/">Dan Frommer in <em>Quartz</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks—where LTE service is available, at least—can now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.</p>

<p>In 2015&#8211;2016, I worked afternoons (3&#8211;11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I&#8217;d sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Jquinta">Juanita</a> and <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Nicole3">Nicole</a> were made. <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/OMFGAshers">Ashers</a> bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)</p>
