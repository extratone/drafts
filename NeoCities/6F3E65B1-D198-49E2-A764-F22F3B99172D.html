<h2>I bought a desktop tower for the first time since 2010 and spent an embarrassingly long time struggling with Bluetooth shit.</h2>

<p>As with my <a href="https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review">entire history</a> of computer purchases, my acquisition of an <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06443577">HP ENVY Desktop tower</a>, today, was last-minute, ill-informed, and certainly irrational. You &#8220;PC master race&#8221; folk: please spare me the <em>dude, you could&#8217;ve just built your own pc so much cheaper</em> shit.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a> Yes, I realize the sensible course of action would&#8217;ve begun with a two hour trip West to the closest Microcenter, where I&#8217;m sure the staff would&#8217;ve made PC shopping an absolute blast and I would&#8217;ve come away with a more powerful, much cheaper machine. However, after I managed to <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/finally-broke-windows/">break Windows</a> on my only machine this weekend (and subsequently failed to reset it,) I was getting especially behind on schoolwork and had <em>absolutely no desire</em> to complete any of it on my iPhone.</p>

<p>And so&#8230; I&#8217;ve just returned from picking up said HP Tower along with a <a href="https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-27f-27-inch-display#!">27&quot; HP LED display</a>, and am writing you after having set up the machine physically and installed most of my &#8220;essential software&#8221; list (at least all that I could remember.) As per my favorite tradition of new computer acquisition, I have named the machine after <a href="https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard">Hildur Odegard</a> from <em>Fortitude</em>.</p>

<h2>&#8220;First Impressions&#8221;</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower - since I first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with which I would create the majority of my intellectual property - and I was immediately surprised by how much smaller (6.12 x 11.93 x 13.28 inches) and lighter (13.12 lbs.) this tower was than my expectations. The display, too, is remarkably light and thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised by this, but I&#8217;m not going to punish myself for continuing to find any sort of magic in technology.</p>

<p>In the box were a Bluetooth keyboard - specifically, an HP model <a href="https://fccid.io/EMJKHSA-P003K">4251a-khsap003k</a> - and mouse set, the latter of which I will hopefully never have to use, thanks to my <a href="https://youtu.be/oIAY1-aW8Es">Logitech G203</a> - and was perplexed by the process of how to pair the former with the tower while it was in setup mode for far too long. I was just about to give up entirely when I revisited the packaging and noticed what I&#8217;d previously assumed was an anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the pair. I continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously, but the multimedia function keys of the product led to some important realizations: I now had reason to use Windows Desktop Switching <em>and</em> have a calculator application again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the Function key&#8217;s behavior (I&#8217;m not even sure it&#8217;s possible:) in order to input <strong>Alt+F4</strong>, I have to input <strong>Fn+Alt+F4</strong>, which is far too clunky to depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation which I may or may not integrate permanently: I mapped <strong>Alt+F4</strong> to the previously-unused button on the very top of the G203. So far, it&#8217;s been pretty nifty.</p>

<p>That said, a component of my intention to create an intentional, static, upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment for a quality mechanical keyboard - my justification was that any professional in a particular craft makes a point to have the best possible tools for the job, so a high-quality keyboard has actually been <em>very</em> long overdue, in my case. So, I sought out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/">a single <em>Wirecutter</em> recommendations list</a> and even attempted to disseminate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a>.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would be able to make heads or tails of the forum or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index">its seemingly endless wikis</a> without considerable indoctrination so I more or less threw a dart and landed on the <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=3504">Varmilo VA108M</a>, which I ordered. All I know is that it&#8217;s fairly highly-reviewed on the marketplaces I checked (though hardly mentioned on the subreddit, actually,) and that it has the <em>Cherry Switches</em>, which are&#8230; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/d3hmw3/my_new_baby_varmilo_108m_cherry_mx_blues_the/">The good ones</a>.</p>

<p>A concern I originally had with taking over the tertiary guest room - by far the smallest allotted living space in the house - as my office was its distance from our wireless router, two floors down. The last time I used the room as a workspace (five years ago,) my old tower&#8217;s integrated WiFi card often struggled to maintain a reliable connection. The adapter included in this desktop, though, actually managed to clock <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678">the fastest download speed on my SpeedTest.net records</a> just now.</p>

<p>Somehow, I just managed to clock the <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678">highest download speed on my record</a> from two floors up!</p>

<h2>Bad(ish)</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s almost painful even to write this but&#8230; As beautiful as this $250 display is to behold, I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to my <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-2">Surface Laptop 2</a>&#8217;s <strong>2256 x 1504 13&quot;</strong> display after years of hard, daily use. Apparently, those dimensions mean the little machine&#8217;s display has a pixel density of <strong>201 Pixels-Per-Inch</strong>. Filling a <strong>27&quot;</strong> display with just <strong>1920 x 1080</strong> means a pixel density of just <strong>81.6 Pixels-Per-Inch</strong>,<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> and the disparity was glaring to my eyes, even from the setup screen. After a few hours of regular use, I&#8217;m not sure I notice it anymore, but I suspect I will again when I&#8217;ve got the laptop running again. Please do indicate whether or not you think such a complaint makes me awful in the <a href="https://poll.fm/10603399">Crowdsignal poll</a> below.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1301337431887708162</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also already had trouble connecting my <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_headphones_support/bose_around_ear_headphones_support/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html">Bose SoundLink headphones</a> correctly via Bluetooth. On my Surface Laptop, it registered as two separate devices - &#8220;Stereo Headphones&#8221; and &#8220;Headset&#8221; - which allowed me to use them as both the primary audio output <em>and</em> the primary audio input. For whatever reason, I have been unable to accomplish such a simultaneous connection on this machine: I can either connect them as headphones or as a headset, but not both. <a href="https://youtu.be/55yn-zF_dZY">This video</a> provided some help - I know now that I have to open Sound Settings and manually connect the headphones every time I re-connect them. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll figure out another solution soon.</p>

<p>Returning to the webcam issue: I discovered that absolutely <em>zero</em> local stores keep add-on webcams in stock anymore, which makes sense. I resorted to searching Amazon for webcams and found a gargantuan list of brands I had never heard of. When I filtered by the one I <em>did</em> recognize - Logitech - I saw barely-facelifted versions of the camera my stepdad bought in 2008 and none were in stock. Unwilling to further investigate or research more, I set the price filter for under $40, sorted by customer ratings, and bought the first product which had even remotely legitimate-looking reviews: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BQZT4N8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">this 1080p <em>thing</em></a> branded with &#8220;Mersuii.&#8221;</p>

<p>After returning to the order invoice hours later for this post, I got curious enough to Google search the company name and discovered a dead-end url, zero Wikipedia page, and <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/863/53/mersuii-86353116.html">this Trademark registration</a>, on which I spotted some very interesting information. Entered in the second &#8220;Goods &amp; Services&#8221; row is the following text:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To hell with that keyboard! Now I am immensely curious as to what I&#8217;ll be receiving in the mail this coming <strong>Monday</strong>, the <strong>7th</strong>.</p>

<p>[1] Or don&#8217;t. Whatever.
[2] I haven&#8217;t even started self-harming yet, so my stomach is definitely strengthening!
[3] I suppose I should not have been surprised to immediately discover a <a href="https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/technology/ppi-calculator.php">dedicated online tool</a> for calculating pixel density.</p>
