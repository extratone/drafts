  <h1>Family Tech Support (PDF Import)</h1>

<p>Hello family! I&#8217;ve thought about creating a text thread like this for a long time - I wanted to create a sort of family tech support space dedicated to sharing stuff about Apple products, specifically.</p>

<p>First, I strongly advise you mute notifications for this group message (Tap on the top of the window - find &#8220;Hide Alerts&#8221; and toggle it on)</p>

<p>Nothing I will share here is time-essential and it would make me feel better if I can freely send you stuff without worrying about it intruding on your day.</p>

<p>Hey guys! I thought I&#8217;d give you some time to turn &#8220;Hide Alerts&#8221; on for this group message, but now I suppose I can explain what I&#8217;m trying to do here.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been wondering what on Earth I&#8217;ve been doing with my time this year, the answer is largely learning to help people with their technology. Frankly, I&#8217;m still not very good at it - I know I&#8217;m much too wordy and tend to confuse easily - but I&#8217;m personally very grateful to have finally begun realizing what it means to add value to others' lives, despite how long it took.</p>

<p>One huge realization I&#8217;ve had about Apple products, specifically, is that Apple has completely departed reality in terms of how the vast majority of its customers use their devices day-to-day. I have already done a lifetime&#8217;s worth of editorializing (complaining) about this, and have realized that my time would be more productively spent helping those closest to me understand the tangible results manifested as changes to their phones.</p>

<p>So to be clear: this chat is <em>not</em> for David to complain at abstract length about consumer technology. I&#8217;m going to do my best to be as simple as possible, but please feel free to call me out if I slip.</p>

<p>call me out if I slip.</p>

<p>What I WOULD like to do is answer questions like Amber&#8217;s (much more promptly than I did) and eventually discuss the upcoming release of iOS 15 (in the next few weeks, by most estimates) in frank terms.</p>

<p>Two resources Apple DOES offer which are sometimes useful.</p>

<p>The iPhone User Guide (sortof an owners manual-ish document.) https://books.apple.com/us/book/iphone-user-guide/ id1515995528</p>

<p>The Tips app, which is more of a &#8220;look how cool this is&#8221; experience. If you&#8217;re ever in a long line or something, you might find it interesting. DEFINITELY disable notifications for it, though. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450</p>

<pre><code>                 Eileen Long
</code></pre>

<p>I really appreciate your concise and swift answers to my cries for help. It is usually something simple for you but hard for me to figure out.</p>

<pre><code>            Eileen Long
</code></pre>

<p>So true</p>

<p>That sortof brings up something I would hope I don&#8217;t have to say:</p>

<p>There really are no dumb questions here. I cannot emphasize that enough.</p>

<p>Remember that when your technology makes you feel dumb, these days, it&#8217;s almost always because some feature/ function has been subtly abstracted away from your control. imo, nobody talks about this enough.</p>

<p>Something I can start with: this one video is all you need to watch regarding the most recent controversies surrounding CSAM + iMessage filtering.</p>

<p>Imo, Joanna Stern&#8217;s (someone I&#8217;ve looked up to my whole adult life) videos for the Journal are THE most concise,</p>

<p>adult life) videos for the Journal are THE most concise, balanced, and effective reporting on Apple, ever, basically.</p>

<p>Hey David. I am thinking about getting a new phone. The 12 Pro Max. What ya think- and they said the 13 will be out soon. Should I wait for that one?</p>

<pre><code>   Sat, Sep 11, 3:17 PM

<p>Definitely wait until Monday at least. That&#8217;s the new iPhone</p>

<p>Ok. Didn&#8217;t realize it was that soon. Do u know if it&#8217;s going to have much better features etc?</p>

<p>Carlos Ruiz</p>

<p>Always newer better features on the new models.</p>

<p>I try not to speculate but the price for the 12 Pro Max might go down a bit.</p>

<pre><code>                       Jenny Wade
</code></pre>

<p>Do u know how much it typically goes down? Our local store said they so far are not cheaper. And they only had one left</p>

<p>$100 used to be the norm but I&#8217;m not sure now.</p>

<p>Thx David. Is it long?</p>

<p>Jenny Wade</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll start with the iPhone first, most likely. And this is a pre-recorded presentation instead of a live one so it should be short. If you&#8217;re not doing anything else, ya might tune in&#8230; Even I have found the pre-made events extremely boring, though.</p>

<p>Amy Ruiz</p>

<p>What were the jobs?</p>

<p>Jenny Wade</p>

<p>One was to work as a BOA for our local Edward Jones Office. It would have taught me a lot. The other is with the schools here in Boone to substitute teach</p>

<p>Amy Ruiz</p>

<p>BOA?</p>

<p>Go with at Edward Jones. They are headquartered here and I need someone to help me invest. Who better than you!</p>

<p>Carlos Ruiz</p>

<p>I agree with Amy!</p>

<p>Jenny Wade</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t they don&#8217;t want to train me with me leaving It would just be a Branch Office Admin</p>

<p>Eileen Long</p>

<p>Right now substitute teaching seems less stressful since you are leaving</p>

<p>Jenny Wade</p>

<p>Yes. And I would like to have some experience for all the work I did to get my certificate.</p>

<p>Interesting. A lady on there said we don&#8217;t wanted to be the United States of Amazon. Any thoughts David on that? They think it&#8217;s taking over and that powerful?</p>

<p>Thu, Sep 16, 9:17 AM</p>

<p>Maybe one or two insightful ones. I guess I have been on a personal &#8220;boycott&#8221; of Amazon since it was just an online book store but I&#8217;ve never needed it to be an ethical one.</p>

<p>I just like nice things, and Amazon on a superficial level is nothing but an incredibly effective de-value machine. It&#8217;s like the ultimate American supervirus borned, loved, and sustained by our infamous compulsion to sacrifice any and all other considerations for convenience. (Personally, I find this habit notably self hating, not selfish.)</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a lot of words but basically: even something as simple as the microfiber cloths i used to order in bulk every once in a while from Amazon Basics can be IMMEDIATELY outdone in quality AND value with like&#8230; the slightest bit of research/browsing outside of Amazon&#8217;s given default answer to any product need. Instead of just ordering them again a few weeks ago, I decided to take the time to find what &#8220;pro&#8221; computer hardware people use and bought a set of 12 directly from a company that <em>really are machine washable.</em></p>

<p>Because I like nice things I buy the pens that show up in amazon results from Goulet Pens' website instead knowing that:</p>

<p>1. it might take a <em>week</em> instead of 40 hours to arrive&#8230;</p>

<p>BUT&#8230;</p>

<p>2. Goulet throws in a hand-written thank you note with ink samples and ships using very cute packaging. They also throw a sucker in, the idea of which I really appreciate.</p>

<p>As opposed to receiving JUST the pen from amazon wrapped in like one entire roll of scotch tape. Even if it would have been faster and a few dollars less.</p>

<p>Thu, Sep 16, 8:10 PM</p>

<p>I do agree we should try to support small businesses and</p>

<p>places with quality products</p>

<p>Renee Godbee</p>

<p>Good points David! I have become quite lazy in my Amazon ease of purchases. You&#8217;ve inspired me to look elsewhere next time</p>

<p>This is worthwhile only because it shows in pictures how to trigger a manual iCloud backup of your phone if you don&#8217;t have automatic ones set up.</p>

<p>Frankly, the actual update process is so much more refined these days that it&#8217;s a bit silly how much emphasis is still put on backups&#8230; Especially for those who use iCloud, generally.</p>

<p>Mon, Sep 20, 4:12 PM</p>

<p>disastrous new new bugs. what I <em>have</em> noticed are more almost down-to-earth echoes of what I&#8217;ve been saying so urgently (read: they seem to agree with me?.)</p>

<p>basically, iOS 15 pretty certainly takes the crown for the most generally boring numerical update to this operating system, ever.</p>

<p>well, that&#8217;s up to you. and by that I mean&#8230; one of the big changes you&#8217;ll notice in the update screen is that you have the option to wait. if you have time, reading as much as you can stand of my own guide <em>before you hit the button</em> couldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>

<pre><code>      This doesn't necessarily have anything to do with iOS 15, per se, but it is somewhat concerning.

<p>It would appear that Meagan&#8217;s old MacBook Pro from no later than 2014 - wherever it may be now - is still associated with my iCloud account but <em>only through the Find My</em> network.</p>

<p>Apple technology&#8217;s particular blend of <em>persistence</em> AND <em>obfuscation</em> is starting to become a disruptive pain in the ass, at the very least.</p>

<p>For the first month of owning this phone, for instance, GARY&#8217;s old contacts were aggressively and repeatedly surfaced for no reason from the depths of &#8230; iCloud???? i can only suppose.</p>

<p>as in, i gave up trying to fix them for a while. you all turned into</p>

<p>&quot; I. C. E. eILEEN&quot;</p>

<p>&#8220;I. C. E. rENEE&#8221;</p>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>to a degree that would NOT have been amusing or charming in the slightest had I been in any other life situation.</p>

<p>(I do actually have specific solutions for these Contacts/ Calendar/Reminder-related problems so please speak up if you&#8217;re having trouble.)</p>
