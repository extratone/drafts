<p>Adi Robertson</p>

<p>Senior reporter, the verge</p>

<p>About the Event</p>

<p>Twenty-five years after it was signed into law, Section 230 is more endangered than ever. Republicans blame it for censorship, Democrats blame it for misinformation, and nearly everyone thinks it needs reform.</p>

<p>But if policymakers aren’t smart about structuring reform, there could be broad, unanticipated consequences for free expression and commerce.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll kick off with a keynote from US Sen. Amy Klobuchar, when she will speak broadly about reining in big tech, her vision for antitrust enforcement, and her new bill that touches on 230 reform, the SAFE TECH Act.</p>

<p>Then Verge senior reporter Adi Robertson will moderate a panel that dives deep into the real-world implications of 230 reform: what’s being considered, the universe of potential outcomes, and the ramifications for individuals and businesses.</p>

<p>Amy Klobuchar</p>

<p>US Senator Amy Klobuchar is the first woman elected to represent the state of Minnesota in the United States Senate. Throughout her public service, Senator Klobuchar has always embraced the values she learned growing up in Minnesota. Her grandfather worked 1,500 feet underground in the iron ore mines of Northern Minnesota. Her father, Jim, was a newspaperman, and her mother, Rose, was an elementary school teacher who continued teaching until she was 70.</p>

<p>Senator Klobuchar has built a reputation of putting partisanship aside to help strengthen the economy and support families, workers, and businesses. In 2016, an analysis by Medill News Service ranked her first among all 100 senators in sponsoring or co-sponsoring bills that were enacted into law in the 114th Congress.</p>

<p>Senator Klobuchar has always understood that her first duty is to represent the people of Minnesota. She acted quickly to obtain full funding to rebuild the I-35W bridge just 13 months after it tragically collapsed into the Mississippi River. She worked across party lines to expand education and job opportunities for returning service members, fought to ensure that Minnesota National Guard members received the full benefits they earned, and helped turn Minnesota&#8217;s groundbreaking Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program into a national model. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Klobuchar worked to pass the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill to strengthen Minnesota’s rural economy and give farmers the certainty and support they need.</p>

<p>Since arriving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar has worked with Democrats and Republicans to get things done. She led the effort to pass landmark pieces of legislation to end human trafficking and to combat the opioid epidemic. She fought to pass the most significant consumer product safety legislation in a generation, keeping foreign toxic products off our shores and out of our stores, and pushed the cell phone companies to enact more consumer-friendly policies. Additionally, her efforts to protect consumers have resulted in the largest furniture recall in American history as well as millions of defective airbags being taken off the road.</p>

<p>As a member of the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Klobuchar has been a leader in working to implement a competitive agenda to ensure businesses have the tools they need to grow and create good jobs in their communities. She has authored legislation to lift the trade embargo with Cuba as well as legislation to help small businesses tap into new markets abroad. She has successfully advocated to take action to combat illegal steel dumping. She has also passed a significant amendment aimed at boosting funds for STEM education for American students and led national initiatives to boost American tourism, including a series of regulatory reforms adopted by the Obama Administration.</p>

<p>Senator Klobuchar also serves as the chairwoman on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, where she has worked to advance policies that protect consumers from anti-competitive behavior and make sure businesses are able to compete on a level playing field. She recently introduced the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act, which would give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen protections against anti-competitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement.</p>

<p>Senator Klobuchar is also the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, where she works to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in government. She helped pass the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate and has authored legislation to automatically register eligible voters when they turn 18. She has also led efforts to improve election security and prevent foreign interference in our democracy, and successfully secured $380 million to strengthen states’ election infrastructure and help protect them from future attacks by foreign adversaries.</p>

<p>Before serving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar headed the largest prosecutor’s office in Minnesota for eight years, making the prosecution of violent and career criminals her top priority as well as an increased focus on white collar crime. She led the effort for successful passage of Minnesota’s first felony DWI law, and received the leadership award from Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Her safe schools initiative, community prosecution efforts, and criminal justice reforms earned national awards from both the Bush and Clinton Justice Departments. She worked with the Innocence Project to advocate for videotaped interrogations across the country as well as innovative eyewitness processes to protect against false identifications. As a private citizen and before being elected to public office, Senator Klobuchar was the leading advocate for successful passage of one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing 48-hour hospital stays for new moms and their babies.</p>

<p>Her work has gained national recognition. <em>Vogue</em> magazine described her as “personable, popular, and pragmatic,” the <em>New York Times</em> described her as a “former prosecutor with made-for-state-fair charms,” and <em>Working Mother</em> magazine named her as &quot;Best in Congress” for her efforts on behalf of working families. She has received numerous awards from the National Farm Bureau and National Farmers Union for championing farmers and rural communities. She has been recognized for her work on behalf of children and consumers, and Refugees International gave her the Congressional Leadership Award for her work to support refugee communities. She received an award from the Service Women&#8217;s Action Network (SWAN) for her work to fight sexual assault in the military, and the Disabled American Veterans honored her work to improve the lives of America’s veterans. She has also received the Outstanding Member of the Senate Award from the National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition and the Above and Beyond Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve for her commitment to developing a supportive work environment for employees serving in the Guard and Reserves.</p>

<p>Senator Klobuchar was the valedictorian of her Wayzata High School class. She graduated magna cum laude from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School. Her senior essay in college, published as the book <em>Uncovering the Dome</em>, chronicles the 10-year history behind the building of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and is still used at colleges and universities across the country.</p>

<p>Senator Klobuchar is married to John Bessler, a native of Mankato, who attended Loyola High School and the University of Minnesota. Senator Klobuchar and John have a daughter, Abigail.</p>

<p>Sydette Harry</p>

<p>Sydette Harry is a researcher, writer, and strategist concentrating on mass communications, informational health, and people-centered technology. Currently, she is working on how race, tech, and gender intersect to influence and create modern, informational, performance, and civic economies, especially around Black and immigrant women.</p>

<p>She was community lead for the Coral Project, and is a senior civic media innovation fellow with USC Annenberg. She has spoken at the UN, Code for America, Google Newsgeist, and OpenNews. Her work has appeared in <em>Wired</em> magazine, The Rockaway Advocate, and Salon, among others.</p>

She worked across party lines to expand education and job opportunities for returning service members, fought to ensure that Minnesota National Guard members received the full benefits they earned, and helped turn Minnesota&#8217;s groundbreaking Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program into a national model. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Klobuchar worked to pass the bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill to strengthen Minnesota’s rural economy and give farmers the certainty and support they need.
 
Since arriving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar has worked with Democrats and Republicans to get things done. She led the effort to pass landmark pieces of legislation to end human trafficking and to combat the opioid epidemic. She fought to pass the most significant consumer product safety legislation in a generation, keeping foreign toxic products off our shores and out of our stores, and pushed the cell phone companies to enact more consumer-friendly policies. Additionally, her efforts to protect consumers have resulted in the largest furniture recall in American history as well as millions of defective airbags being taken off the road.
 
As a member of the Joint Economic Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Klobuchar has been a leader in working to implement a competitive agenda to ensure businesses have the tools they need to grow and create good jobs in their communities. She has authored legislation to lift the trade embargo with Cuba as well as legislation to help small businesses tap into new markets abroad. She has successfully advocated to take action to combat illegal steel dumping. She has also passed a significant amendment aimed at boosting funds for STEM education for American students and led national initiatives to boost American tourism, including a series of regulatory reforms adopted by the Obama Administration.
 
Senator Klobuchar also serves as the chairwoman on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, where she has worked to advance policies that protect consumers from anti-competitive behavior and make sure businesses are able to compete on a level playing field. She recently introduced the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act, which would give federal enforcers the resources they need to do their jobs, strengthen protections against anti-competitive conduct and mergers, and make additional reforms to improve enforcement.
 
Senator Klobuchar is also the chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, where she works to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in government. She helped pass the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate and has authored legislation to automatically register eligible voters when they turn 18. She has also led efforts to improve election security and prevent foreign interference in our democracy, and successfully secured $380 million to strengthen states’ election infrastructure and help protect them from future attacks by foreign adversaries.
 
Before serving in the Senate, Senator Klobuchar headed the largest prosecutor’s office in Minnesota for eight years, making the prosecution of violent and career criminals her top priority as well as an increased focus on white collar crime. She led the effort for successful passage of Minnesota’s first felony DWI law, and received the leadership award from Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Her safe schools initiative, community prosecution efforts, and criminal justice reforms earned national awards from both the Bush and Clinton Justice Departments. She worked with the Innocence Project to advocate for videotaped interrogations across the country as well as innovative eyewitness processes to protect against false identifications. As a private citizen and before being elected to public office, Senator Klobuchar was the leading advocate for successful passage of one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing 48-hour hospital stays for new moms and their babies.
 
Her work has gained national recognition. Vogue magazine described her as “personable, popular, and pragmatic,” the New York Times described her as a “former prosecutor with made-for-state-fair charms,” and Working Mother magazine named her as &quot;Best in Congress” for her efforts on behalf of working families. She has received numerous awards from the National Farm Bureau and National Farmers Union for championing farmers and rural communities. She has been recognized for her work on behalf of children and consumers, and Refugees International gave her the Congressional Leadership Award for her work to support refugee communities. She received an award from the Service Women&#8217;s Action Network (SWAN) for her work to fight sexual assault in the military, and the Disabled American Veterans honored her work to improve the lives of America’s veterans. She has also received the Outstanding Member of the Senate Award from the National Narcotic Officers’ Associations’ Coalition and the Above and Beyond Award from the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve for her commitment to developing a supportive work environment for employees serving in the Guard and Reserves.
 
Senator Klobuchar was the valedictorian of her Wayzata High School class. She graduated magna cum laude from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School. Her senior essay in college, published as the book Uncovering the Dome, chronicles the 10-year history behind the building of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and is still used at colleges and universities across the country.
 
Senator Klobuchar is married to John Bessler, a native of Mankato, who attended Loyola High School and the University of Minnesota. Senator Klobuchar and John have a daughter, Abigail.</p>
