<p><em>The following is the full text of Jack Dorsey’s public resignation letter, captured via OCR from <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">the image he Tweeted on November 29th</a>.</em></p>

<p>Hello team.</p>

<p>After almost 16 years of having a role at our company&#8230;from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO&#8230;I decided it&#8217;s finally time for me to leave. Why?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being &#8220;founder-led.&#8221; Ultimately I believe that&#8217;s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I&#8217;ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders. There are 3 reasons I believe now is the right time.</p>

<p>The first is Parag becoming our CEO. The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag. He&#8217;s been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs. Parag has been behind every critical decision that helped turn this company around. He&#8217;s curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware, and humble. He leads with heart and soul, and is someone I learn from daily. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep.</p>

<p>The second is Bret Taylor agreeing to become our board chair. I asked Bret to join our board when I became CEO, and he&#8217;s been excellent in every way. He understands entrepreneurship, taking risks, companies at massive scale, technology, product, and he&#8217;s an engineer. All of the things the board and the company deserve right now. Having Bret in this leadership role gives me a lot of confidence in the strength of our board going forward. You have no idea how happy this makes me!</p>

<p>The third is all of you. We have a lot of ambition and potential on this team. Consider this: Parag started here as an engineer who cared deeply about our work and now he&#8217;s our CEO (I also had a similar path&#8230;he did it better!). This alone makes me proud. I know that Parag will be able to channel this energy best because he&#8217;s lived it and knows what it takes. All of you have the potential to change the course of this company for the better. I believe this with all my heart!</p>

<p>Parag is CEO starting today. I&#8217;m going to serve on the board through my term (May-ish) to help Parag and Bret with the transition. And after that&#8230;Ill leave the board. Why not stay or become chair? I believe it&#8217;s really important to give Parag the space he needs to lead. And back to my previous point, I believe it&#8217;s critical a company can stand on its own, free of its founder&#8217;s influence or direction.</p>

<p>I want you all to know that this was my decision and I own it. It was a tough one for me, of course. I love this service and company… and all of you so much. I&#8217;m really sad&#8230;yet really happy. There aren&#8217;t many companies that get to this level. And there aren&#8217;t many founders that choose their company over their own ego. I know we&#8217;ll prove this was the right move.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll have an all-hands meeting tomorrow at 9:05 AM Pacific to discuss it all. Until then, thank you all for the trust you&#8217;ve placed in me, and for the openness to build that trust in Parag and yourselves. I love you all.</p>

<p>jack</p>

<p>PS I&#8217;m tweeting this email. My one wish is for Twitter Inc to be the most transparent company in the world. Hi mom!</p>
