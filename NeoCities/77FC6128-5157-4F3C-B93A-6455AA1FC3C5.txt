2022-02-28 18:50:04	dzwdz	i forgot that i'm stressed out for a while
2022-02-28 18:51:07	bx	that's nice
2022-02-28 18:51:12	bx	i think
2022-02-28 18:51:22	bx	depends on how hard unforgetting hits you
2022-02-28 18:51:27	nihilazo	I'm doing OK ish
2022-02-28 18:51:33	nihilazo	today at college sure did exist
2022-02-28 18:51:49	nihilazo	not looking forward to tomorrow
2022-02-28 18:52:18	nihilazo	got a driving lesson and also politics class. and it's my first driving lesson on actual roads. aaaaaaaaaaa
2022-02-28 18:52:31	nihilazo	if I crash, at least I don't have to go to politics class
2022-02-28 18:52:36	bx	...
2022-02-28 18:52:45	bx	im sure you wont crash
2022-02-28 18:52:51	bx	despite gur motive
2022-02-28 18:52:52	nihilazo	(it's in a dual control car, there's no way I'll crash)
2022-02-28 18:53:09	bx	there's no way that stops everyone
2022-02-28 18:53:15	nihilazo	but yeah I'm a bit very scared by driving
2022-02-28 18:53:20	nihilazo	and it's an early morning for me
2022-02-28 18:53:29	nihilazo	and uhh
2022-02-28 18:53:29	nihilazo	yeah
2022-02-28 18:53:30	bx	are you a morning person
2022-02-28 18:53:33	nihilazo	no
2022-02-28 18:53:36	nihilazo	no way
2022-02-28 18:53:43	nihilazo	but it was the only time I could have a driving lesson
2022-02-28 18:53:45	nihilazo	at 9am
2022-02-28 18:54:06	nihilazo	(which is early to be driving when you havn't a fucking clue how to drive)
2022-02-28 18:54:27	nihilazo	I swear that driving a car is like the most dangerous thing that a person can ever do
2022-02-28 18:54:56	nihilazo	I don't want to drive, I don't like cars, but I'm learning now for the purely economic reason that my mum is paying for my lessons
2022-02-28 18:55:10	dzwdz	how about blindfolded running with scissors on a tightrope?
2022-02-28 18:55:20	bx	naw thats much safer
2022-02-28 18:55:26	nihilazo	that's a lot safer
2022-02-28 18:55:28	bx	there are safety nets
2022-02-28 18:55:34	nihilazo	^
2022-02-28 18:55:35	bx	plus at most you can harm 1 person, yourself
2022-02-28 18:56:02	bx	in a car if you fuck up too hard a whole bunch of people can get maimed/killed
2022-02-28 18:56:24	 *	bx 's main issue with cars is this
2022-02-28 18:57:04	dzwdz	uhhh what
2022-02-28 18:57:12	bx	i really dont understand how anyone thinks its a good idea given gur body count
2022-02-28 18:57:26	dzwdz	i don't think we're going to the same blindfolded tightrope scissor running classes
2022-02-28 18:57:57	nihilazo	the worst case in a blindfolded tightrop scissor running situation is that you hurt yourself
2022-02-28 18:58:04	nihilazo	maybe "hurt" here is terminal hurting
2022-02-28 18:58:15	nihilazo	in a car, you can kill and/or maim many many people
2022-02-28 18:58:15	bx	"knives those are bad we gotta stop people having those", "oh three people died to cars this afternoon? don't worry about it"
2022-02-28 18:58:16	nihilazo	by accident
2022-02-28 18:58:25	dzwdz	dude what
2022-02-28 18:58:33	dzwdz	what if you jam the scissors into some people's neck along the way
2022-02-28 18:58:44	nihilazo	that would have to be a deliberate act, right
2022-02-28 18:58:50	bx	dzwdz: why are they on gur tightrope with us?
2022-02-28 18:58:51	dzwdz	ok ok we get it
2022-02-28 18:59:02	dzwdz	you're an amazing blindfolded tightrope scissor runner
2022-02-28 18:59:07	dzwdz	not all of us have the skills to avoid people
2022-02-28 18:59:19	bx	ok, but they can also avoid *you*
2022-02-28 18:59:28	dzwdz	they're blindfolded
2022-02-28 18:59:35	bx	that option is pretty limmitted in a car
2022-02-28 18:59:40	bx	gur avoiding i mean
2022-02-28 18:59:51	dzwdz	at least you're not blindfolded
2022-02-28 18:59:55	dzwdz	so you know what killed you
2022-02-28 19:00:29	dzwdz	dying in a blindfolded tightrope scissor running is terrible because you don't even know who to haunt afterwards
2022-02-28 19:00:40	dzwdz	s/is/accident is
2022-02-28 19:00:41	sedbot	<dzwdz> dying in a blindfolded tightrope scaccident issor running is terrible because you don't even know who to haunt afterwards
2022-02-28 19:00:43	bx	that just means you can moveon
2022-02-28 19:00:50	bx	wait
2022-02-28 19:00:55	dzwdz	no? i'm looking for fucking revenge?
2022-02-28 19:00:59	bx	gur victims arent blindfolded
2022-02-28 19:01:04	dzwdz	they are
2022-02-28 19:01:10	dzwdz	otherwise they're cheating
2022-02-28 19:01:20	bx	why is more than one person involved in this
2022-02-28 19:01:50	dzwdz	it's not very sportsmanlike to go to a blindfolded tightrope scissor running club and not wear a blindfold
2022-02-28 19:02:28	bx	ok if this is a club im assuming people consented to gur risk
2022-02-28 19:02:31	bx	in which case
2022-02-28 19:02:40	bx	you aint got a right to haunt
2022-02-28 19:03:14	dzwdz	everyone's got a right to haunt
2022-02-28 19:03:21	dzwdz	i believe in second chances
2022-02-28 19:04:13	extratone	anyway. what's euphoria?
2022-02-28 19:04:14	bx	what happens when gur hauntee becomes a ghost too?
2022-02-28 19:04:27	dzwdz	there's no hauntee because you died blindfolded
2022-02-28 19:04:31	dzwdz	you don't know who to haunt
2022-02-28 19:04:36	bx	well
2022-02-28 19:04:45	bx	you could find out by asking around
2022-02-28 19:04:55	bx	reviewing footage from gur day
2022-02-28 19:04:59	bx	you may have options
2022-02-28 19:05:05	bx	extratone: as in gur definition?
2022-02-28 19:05:10	dzwdz	it's the blindfolded fucking tightrope scissor running clubs
2022-02-28 19:05:15	dzwdz	everyone's blindfolded
2022-02-28 19:05:19	dzwdz	who would you ask
2022-02-28 19:05:25	nihilazo	fucking tightrope?
2022-02-28 19:05:28	nihilazo	kinky
2022-02-28 19:05:41	bx	"yeah im really into falling from hights"

2022-03-01 02:29:11	anton	wait
2022-03-01 02:30:20	anton	why is it "Joy of Linux" and not "Joy of GNU/Linux"?
2022-03-01 02:31:31	piusbird	d'oh guess i'll have to rerecord the intro for a fourth time

2022-03-01 02:34:32	anton	that reminds of of an article I read like a month or 2 ago lol
2022-03-01 02:34:41	anton	re-read*
2022-03-01 02:35:06	anton	http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609
2022-03-01 02:35:27	anton	I don't think Eric opensource[1] would agree with you :p
2022-03-01 02:36:02	anton	[1]: term misses the point. see https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html
2022-03-01 02:36:22	elly	wangofett: lol, no, not a new job
2022-03-01 02:36:39	elly	I've been on this team for like 10 months now, but we're normally all in separate offices anyway
2022-03-01 02:36:45	elly	and because of COVID we haven't had occasion to gather yet
2022-03-01 02:36:52	elly	so this'll be my first time meeting any of these folks
2022-03-01 02:37:25	wangofett	ah, nice
2022-03-01 02:37:41	elly	yeah, I'm excited :)
2022-03-01 02:38:01	anton	nice!
2022-03-01 02:38:09	elly	piusbird: "public email inbox" is an interesting choice - most organizations specifically have a *private* way to report problems
2022-03-01 02:38:23	elly	so that people can report things without having everyone know they did so
2022-03-01 02:38:38	piusbird	ok I shall reword that
2022-03-01 02:39:09	elly	what would a content warning look like for an excessively long toot? just "cw long"?
2022-03-01 02:39:22	anton	I don't have a public inbox [since I don't know how to properly do one lol]
2022-03-01 02:39:39	elly	a mailing list with a public archive is the usual way
2022-03-01 02:39:40	anton	elly: long toots need a content warning? o_o
2022-03-01 02:39:51	elly	"""
2022-03-01 02:39:52	llamanator	anton: what's this tea cup? haha
2022-03-01 02:39:52	elly	Clearly communicated and accurately labeled content warnings and sensitive image settings are required when having public conversations involving any of the following topics or content:
2022-03-01 02:39:57	elly	...
2022-03-01 02:40:00	elly	    Excessively Long Toots (longer than ~20 lines)
2022-03-01 02:40:01	elly	"""
2022-03-01 02:40:08	anton	I think I've been mastodoning wrong
2022-03-01 02:40:20	anton	llamanator: coffee cup since the tea cups are still dirty
2022-03-01 02:40:29	piusbird	yeah clearly i didn't edit as carefully as i thoought
2022-03-01 02:40:46	piusbird	we'll just mark that for edits
2022-03-01 02:41:06	llamanator	anton: is that a c[f] then?
2022-03-01 02:41:33	elly	piusbird: looks pretty okay overall :) I'm curious about the remarks about economics too
2022-03-01 02:41:34	piusbird	so the intent of thee public inbox is that it be the ordinary way of working
2022-03-01 02:41:51	anton	c[t]
2022-03-01 02:42:02	llamanator	c[t]
2022-03-01 02:42:03	llamanator	cheers
2022-03-01 02:42:11	piusbird	originally i wanted to use a peertube instance
2022-03-01 02:42:22	anton	c[f] is the FSF mug
2022-03-01 02:42:30	piusbird	but costs proved prohibitive
2022-03-01 02:42:34	elly	ah, okay
2022-03-01 02:42:49	anton	you can buy a c[t] or c[~] mug from the new town shop! (see tilde.town/shop/)
2022-03-01 02:42:50	elly	so really it's like "To the extent practical we will use free software and open standards"
2022-03-01 02:43:07	elly	anton: that link doesn't work for me
2022-03-01 02:43:14	piusbird	so Twitch and Youtube with mirroring to IA when i figure that out
2022-03-01 02:43:27	anton	vilmibm: any chance we can have a tilde.town shop?
2022-03-01 02:44:21	piusbird	anyway the Nurse Radchet alarm just went off
2022-03-01 02:44:33	elly	uhoh?
2022-03-01 02:44:36	piusbird	time for meds and bed
2022-03-01 02:45:01	anton	just noticed "This instance is administered by the site owner, @mawr. Additional moderation support is provided by @Solitaire."
2022-03-01 02:45:15	elly	oh, I see
2022-03-01 02:45:20	elly	oh yeah, medication
2022-03-01 02:45:22	elly	good idea!
2022-03-01 03:04:34	anton	rip chat
2022-03-01 03:06:37	elly	rip chat indeed
2022-03-01 03:06:53	elly	I don't really want to live-blog about my life more and don't have anything else to say :)

2022-03-01 04:08:06	anton	I think I just want to review whatever businesses I come across lol
2022-03-01 04:09:23	elly	you could! I try to only write one if I have something to say
2022-03-01 04:10:15	natalia	at some point, i'd certainly like to make a list of the music that influenced me the most and what my relationship to it is
2022-03-01 04:10:27	natalia	but yeah it does have the problem of sometimes i don't have something that's concrete or valuable to other people
2022-03-01 04:11:45	anton	so would the country/region/city/#company format work for linking to reviews, or is country/region/city/company.html better?
2022-03-01 04:12:00	elly	those are interchangeable
2022-03-01 04:12:06	elly	imo
2022-03-01 04:12:18	elly	or, let me put it this way: what prompts your question?
2022-03-01 04:15:45	natalia	you can easily redirect between the two and also like it doesnt matter
2022-03-01 04:16:39	natalia	do whatever makes the page feel more navigable which is probably together if they are really short and separate (with summaries) if theyre long
2022-03-01 04:16:56	natalia	and even then the url scheme only implise things about that but like you could make the # thing look like individual pages if you wanted to change
2022-03-01 04:17:39	natalia	and structurally/hierarchically they are like the same
2022-03-01 04:18:24	elly	yeah
2022-03-01 04:27:01	natalia	hmm. not sure what to do tonight
2022-03-01 04:27:04	anton	would it help to keep each company on its own page?
2022-03-01 04:27:57	natalia	i think thats the same question and has the same (mostly minute) answer?
2022-03-01 04:28:22	anton	o
2022-03-01 04:28:35	elly	help with what?
2022-03-01 04:28:59	elly	natalia: I am reading long-form journalism and can endorse it as an activity
2022-03-01 04:29:05	anton	make them easier to navigate
2022-03-01 04:30:10	natalia	elly: reading *is* high up on my list, although probably short stories in spanish instead
2022-03-01 04:30:24	natalia	maybe after i journal though
2022-03-01 04:30:31	natalia	anton: well, what do your reviews look like?
2022-03-01 04:30:34	elly	anton: URLs don't have much to do with how easy it is to navigate something, imo
2022-03-01 04:30:49	elly	people navigate via links and searching
2022-03-01 04:31:06	elly	so as long as you have the right links the actual structure doesn't matter all that much
2022-03-01 04:31:15	natalia	your structure depends on what your content looks like. if you make decisions about the structure you are also making some decisions about what the content is more likely to look like
2022-03-01 04:31:31	anton	natalia: I don't have anything yet
2022-03-01 04:31:50	natalia	well then it may be hard to get a good idea for how you want to structure it
2022-03-01 04:32:03	elly	I think it's better to write some things, then figure out how to arrange them
2022-03-01 04:32:12	natalia	i'm disregarding the urls themselves because i think you're referring to just how the page is laid out--

2022-03-01 04:32:26	anton	thx
2022-03-01 04:32:33	elly	if your reviews are multiple thousands of words with many images, separate pages makes a lot more sense than if they're a paragraph or two each

2022-03-01 04:32:56	anton	I don't think I'll actually write that much
2022-03-01 04:33:05	anton	just a general description more or less
2022-03-01 04:33:32	anton	anything longer imo seems like it'll belong on a blog
2022-03-01 04:34:31	natalia	if the content is really small its probably better to reduce how much you need to navigate to See Anything, then
2022-03-01 04:34:36	elly	yeah, same
2022-03-01 04:34:58	elly	page navigations provide cognitive breaks between contexts, and feel bad when there are many small pages, at least to me
2022-03-01 04:35:02	natalia	if i have to traverse like 4 pages to get 2 paragraphs each then that's a no go
2022-03-01 04:35:04	natalia	mm
2022-03-01 04:35:15	natalia	there's nothing stopping you from just linking to your blog
2022-03-01 04:35:32	elly	yeah
2022-03-01 04:36:51	elly	man, The Cut's editorial voice seems to involve pieces that have no actual conclusion
2022-03-01 04:37:57	natalia	yeah?
2022-03-01 04:38:10	extratone	I just wanna interject real quick and note - reading over it again - that the Tilde.Town chat etiquette document is a work of art and I mean that 120% sincerely.
2022-03-01 04:39:44	extratone	are y'all talking about the Vox Media-owned The Cut?
2022-03-01 04:39:54	elly	I have no particular followup to that, it is just a thing I noticed
2022-03-01 04:39:59	elly	extratone: perhaps? it's part of NY Magazine
2022-03-01 04:40:16	extratone	that's the one. 
2022-03-01 04:40:30	elly	aha, Vox does own NY
2022-03-01 04:40:32	elly	so yes, I am
2022-03-01 04:41:36	extratone	if I remember correctly, The Cut's pretty glossy/special interesty. conclusions might be too much to expect lol.
2022-03-01 04:41:51	elly	I'm not sure - they have some pretty good writing sometimes
2022-03-01 04:42:00	extratone	tbh I can't remember the last time I came to an unequuivolcal conclusion in anything I've written.
2022-03-01 04:42:03	elly	but like, here's part of the last paragraph of an article:
2022-03-01 04:42:04	elly	She will do this not with the help of Aunt Becky — towards whom she still feels “some resentment,” according to ET, for creating a “scandal has marked her and will never entirely go away” — but her father, who “understands business.” And also, according to one report, how to leverage a fraudulent college career into a company.
2022-03-01 04:42:11	elly	that's the last sentence there, literally
2022-03-01 04:42:14	elly	zero wrapup on the story
2022-03-01 04:42:32	extratone	oh wow that *is* a bail lol
2022-03-01 04:42:36	elly	yeah
2022-03-01 04:42:41	elly	they're just like "I am done typing now"
2022-03-01 04:43:32	extratone	I have no idea what deadlines look like in an organization like that tbh.
2022-03-01 04:43:57	extratone	really wish The Verge would talk about technology sometimes tho lol
2022-03-01 04:46:20	elly	The Verge is more like, writing about the tech industry than technology itself

2022-03-01 05:31:44	natalia	   Since the local time zone of a site may be useful for determining a

2022-03-01 05:31:48	natalia	   susceptible to a security probe, some sites may wish to emit times in

2022-03-01 05:48:15	elly	m455: I do not really like LA to be honest, it has a lot of the bad qualities of cities for me (crowded, noisy) and is also very spread out / hard to navigate on foot
2022-03-01 05:48:34	elly	LA is one of the few cities I have been to where I basically have to use a taxi to get from the airport to anywhere
2022-03-01 05:48:39	m455	elly: that's also true! i think a lot of what we experienced was novelties
2022-03-01 05:48:56	m455	ooof that's true. we rented a car, so we were hidden away from that extreme inconvenience!
2022-03-01 05:49:06	m455	i don't know if i could live there though haha
2022-03-01 05:49:29	m455	no clue though lol

2022-03-01 05:50:33	m455	i know, for work, when we got to go somewhere to see teammates, it made me so happy, because i really like all the folks on my team
2022-03-01 05:50:48	m455	and my team lead is absolutely wonderful
2022-03-01 05:50:55	elly	I will be enjoying that a lot, yeah
2022-03-01 05:51:00	elly	most of them arrive tomorrow
2022-03-01 05:51:08	natalia	holy shit i cant believe you have to pay for iso 8601-2
2022-03-01 05:51:12	m455	ouuu that's good at least! hopefully it's a good distraction from being a in a city you don't like that much!
2022-03-01 05:51:13	natalia	this is the worst document ive read in my entire life
2022-03-01 05:51:18	natalia	sorry to interrupt lol
2022-03-01 05:51:34	m455	natalia: LOL god yeah, i didn't know you ahad to pay for ISOs until i had to look one up a few years ago xD

2022-03-01 05:51:49	m455	LOL
2022-03-01 05:52:06	m455	natalia: is that the format? haha
2022-03-01 05:52:07	natalia	look what they have done with the c standard money and paywalling we have made for them (this is REAL datetime standards, written by REAL datetime standardizers)
2022-03-01 05:52:20	m455	goshhhh
2022-03-01 05:52:45	m455	i never understood why standards are paywalled, i always thought they were for like public consumption/reference
2022-03-01 05:52:58	m455	then agian, i don't know a lot about standards haha
2022-03-01 05:53:00	natalia	to be clear this is not a standard people actually use--people use iso 8601-1 if at all
2022-03-01 05:53:02	natalia	but MAN is it funny
2022-03-01 05:53:09	m455	haha i understand
2022-03-01 05:53:36	m455	i only know i like the yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss ("big" to "small") format haha
2022-03-01 05:53:50	m455	now i'm curious about 8601 2 lol
2022-03-01 05:55:02	m455	elly: i really enjoyed that most of the work trip was things like dinner, karaoke, escape rooms, and just chilling with teammates, and then there was just one day full of work, instead of every day working haha. it was really great for bonding, and in hte past i always disliked team bonding events, but like, it felt like this team did it right (i
2022-03-01 05:55:04	m455	think my team lead and one of my team members organized it)
2022-03-01 05:55:53	m455	natalia: LOL i just found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/ISO8601/comments/mikuj1/i_bought_iso_860112019_and_860122019_ask_me/
2022-03-01 05:56:48	m455	this thread is going nowhere but i like reading some of the funny comments lol
2022-03-01 05:57:01	m455	this reddit thread*
2022-03-01 05:58:39	natalia	the best part is all of the funky things are just implementation defined
2022-03-01 05:58:52	natalia	how many more digits do you put into your year marker if you want years past 9999? you have to decide between the sender/receiver
2022-03-01 05:59:19	m455	natalia: oh what, so they made the definition based off of (an) implementation(s), instead of the other way around? haha
2022-03-01 05:59:56	m455	haha oh shit that is some next level (next year?) stuff? i didn't even think about passed 9999 LOL
2022-03-01 06:00:04	natalia	what led me down the rabbit hole, btw https://i.redd.it/mumdxume3wf81.png
2022-03-01 06:00:14	m455	(no question mark after "stuff" lmao)
2022-03-01 06:00:18	 *	m455 looks
2022-03-01 06:00:27	m455	LOLLLL
2022-03-01 06:00:27	natalia	m455: implementation defined means that how you implement it is based on the particulars of the implementation, usually with a set of restrictions
2022-03-01 06:00:42	m455	ohhhhhh
2022-03-01 06:00:59	m455	i totally misunderstood that term then lol
2022-03-01 06:01:08	natalia	for example, the restriction here is "you have to add a amount of digits to the 4 year digit format, and that amount has to be fixed and agreed upon between whoever reads and writes dates in your context"
2022-03-01 06:01:22	m455	lmao that bottom of the iceberg one htat you pasted still looks wild
2022-03-01 06:01:30	m455	ohhhhhh wow
2022-03-01 06:01:45	m455	so each implementation may have different formats then i guess
2022-03-01 06:01:57	m455	depending on what is agreed upon
2022-03-01 06:02:11	m455	that sounds like it would be hard to agree upon but i think that's becausei  have no clue what context that would happen in hahaha
2022-03-01 06:03:20	natalia	something that might be implementation defined is for example sizeof(int) in C
2022-03-01 06:03:23	m455	oh shit, my brain, i totally forgot i was going to fuck with apl
2022-03-01 06:03:36	m455	oh what that's interesting
2022-03-01 06:05:38	m455	is that kind of like they agree how big a max size is allowed to be before things start to get undefined or throw errors?
2022-03-01 06:05:43	natalia	obviously the size of an integer depends on what computer you run it on, but it's not like it can't be anything
2022-03-01 06:06:10	natalia	sure
2022-03-01 06:07:40	m455	ohhh i forgot about the computer archicture stuff with 32 and 64 bit lol. didn't even think of that. that stuff is definitely over my head knowledge wise haha
2022-03-01 06:17:48	m455	kk i'm gonna go to bed, talk to you all another time!

2022-03-01 10:55:56	extratone	oh I'm tired I'm sorry. idk why it didn't register that you wanna do em yourself
2022-03-01 10:56:23	extratone	maybe go somewhere and get them done first? it's too cheap, at least where I live.
2022-03-01 10:56:58	dzwdz	eh
2022-03-01 10:57:03	dzwdz	i don't want to

2022-03-03 18:53:00	dzwdz	i think i'm on some opioids but i have no idea what i'm on exactly
2022-03-03 18:53:31	dzwdz	what are all those missing character boxes
2022-03-03 18:53:44	juspib	i found some beet juice and it's surprisingly beet
2022-03-03 18:53:45	bx	>good morning
2022-03-03 18:54:12	extratone	sounds like we're all on/off drugs it's lit. we have ignition.
2022-03-03 18:55:19	juspib	drugs are bad

2022-03-03 18:55:44	bx	bugs are drad
2022-03-03 18:56:00	bx	also loggin on to go werk
2022-03-03 18:57:59	elly	I am pleased to report that my "stand outside in the sun" strategy was a total success
2022-03-03 18:58:29	natalia	congrats
2022-03-03 18:58:47	dzwdz	\o/
2022-03-03 18:59:53	extratone	whoo!
2022-03-03 19:00:09	extratone	vitamin D, right?
2022-03-03 19:00:54	elly	yeah, but also sunlight is pleasing in and of itself
2022-03-03 19:01:02	elly	a few of my teammates came to stand in the sun with me and be plants together
2022-03-03 19:05:57	dusted	I'm selling one of my reel to reel players, so I took some pictures for the potential buyer, they're cute enough that I thought maybe someone technologically oriented might appreciate them :) (click for full view) http://dusted.dk/pages/guesswork/akai-pics/
2022-03-03 19:07:04	natalia	haha these are lovely
2022-03-03 19:10:59	nihilazo	anybody here have any experience with lazarus/freepascal
2022-03-03 19:11:00	nihilazo	is it any good
2022-03-03 19:11:32	nihilazo	the idea of making cross platform native GUI apps with relatively smol executables and no deps seems neat
2022-03-03 19:11:39	nihilazo	w/ a visual GUI builder
2022-03-03 19:13:22	dzwdz	i think i used it for something, but it was too long ago to remember
2022-03-03 19:13:33	elly	I have never tried it and do not have a good impression of Pascal generally but I would love to hear your impressions of it
2022-03-03 19:14:51	nihilazo	doing GUI without a GUI builder is painful to me
2022-03-03 19:14:51	nihilazo	well
2022-03-03 19:14:57	nihilazo	doing GUI using a toolkit without a builder
2022-03-03 19:15:07	nihilazo	I can do GUI from scratch with just drawing shit on the screen myself
2022-03-03 19:15:34	dusted	I liked the old way of building gui, winforms, java swing, qt designer, even the glade tool.. everything that is not HTML and CSS
2022-03-03 19:15:49	elly	you can still write GUIs that way if you want to
2022-03-03 19:15:56	dusted	probably liked them for every reason modern UX people hate them
2022-03-03 19:16:06	nihilazo	first impression
2022-03-03 19:16:07	nihilazo	https://ttm.sh/ikd.png
2022-03-03 19:16:08	dusted	and I do ^_^
2022-03-03 19:16:09	nihilazo	what the hell
2022-03-03 19:16:11	nihilazo	lol
2022-03-03 19:16:19	nihilazo	these should not be seperate windows
2022-03-03 19:16:54	nihilazo	I should just actually learn qt lol
2022-03-03 19:17:09	nihilazo	instead of looking for weird new ideas
2022-03-03 19:17:15	dzwdz	generally speaking i'm not a fan of gui things where you align shit manually
2022-03-03 19:17:42	nihilazo	but qt is confusing to me because of like
2022-03-03 19:17:46	nihilazo	qt and qt quick and everything else
2022-03-03 19:17:53	nihilazo	why is there so much different qt shit
2022-03-03 19:18:06	dzwdz	why is everything so qt
2022-03-03 19:20:19	nihilazo	I don't like any gui framework
2022-03-03 19:20:28	nihilazo	I've yet to find one that isn't garbage in some way
2022-03-03 19:21:13	elly	I don't think you will find such a thing
2022-03-03 19:21:41	elly	UI toolkits all make tradeoffs between like, code size, complexity of API, portability, write-once-ness, native look and feel, performance, etc etc etc
2022-03-03 19:21:46	nihilazo	yeah
2022-03-03 19:22:40	natalia	playing with a design concept and i am thinking for ui i might just do a localhost web server
2022-03-03 19:22:50	elly	(a lot of big projects write their own bespoke UI toolkits that match their own tradeoff needs better)
2022-03-03 19:24:04	dusted	natalia: it's a very quick way to make something work
2022-03-03 19:24:29	natalia	dusted: yeah
2022-03-03 19:24:43	natalia	the problem i have with most handgrown ui frameworks is like, they're usually inaccessible and just aren't as smart at layout
2022-03-03 19:24:50	dusted	But I can't get over that it feels a little silly connecting to websites that are literally hosted on my own computer
2022-03-03 19:24:58	elly	natalia: making them accessible is indeed a serious undertaking
2022-03-03 19:25:02	nihilazo	yeah, bespoke UI is kinda
2022-03-03 19:25:09	elly	I have done a lot of accessibility work on chrome's UI toolkit and goddamn is it hard :P
2022-03-03 19:25:11	nihilazo	it doesn't feel good on any platform, really
2022-03-03 19:25:17	nihilazo	and accessibility is difficult
2022-03-03 19:25:18	elly	especially on Mac and Linux
2022-03-03 19:25:20	natalia	i have never done work on native ui accessibility
2022-03-03 19:25:22	nihilazo	and it often breaks user expectations
2022-03-03 19:25:26	dusted	bespoke UIs have their place in stuff like computer games
2022-03-03 19:25:30	nihilazo	unless you're smart with doing it
2022-03-03 19:25:34	elly	ya
2022-03-03 19:25:46	elly	it is frankly out of reach to do properly unless you have an entire team to build and maintain the toolkit
2022-03-03 19:25:51	nihilazo	it would be nice if linux had an actual native UI toolkit instead of a million different shitty ones all pretending to be a native UI toolkit
2022-03-03 19:25:55	nihilazo	lol
2022-03-03 19:25:56	elly	if you want accessibility and internationalization to work properly across platforms
2022-03-03 19:26:51	elly	the Linux situation where there are a few competing toolkits is pretty horrible to develop for
2022-03-03 19:27:02	elly	fortunately Linux users mostly don't care all that much :P
2022-03-03 19:27:24	dusted	..and then we discover that some alphabets have more characters than are in the ascii one.. and then we discover that some languages are written from right to left, and theeen that some are written from top to bottom, and right to left and everything is all over the place and we quit even trying :D
2022-03-03 19:27:37	elly	yes
2022-03-03 19:28:38	elly	that's part of why people like developing against the web as a UI target, fwiw
2022-03-03 19:29:01	elly	accessibility and internationalization actually *do* work across platforms if you annotate your UI elements well
2022-03-03 19:29:06	natalia	it's wonderful
2022-03-03 19:29:33	natalia	i want my system to be reasonable on lower power devices.. so my plan is just to like, only have it be static HTML
2022-03-03 19:29:39	natalia	er, static is a weird name there--jsless, i mean
2022-03-03 19:29:59	elly	yea
2022-03-03 19:30:03	elly	html + css :)
2022-03-03 19:30:32	elly	web UI also (if you are a bit careful) solves the problem of having your thing work on mobile devices
2022-03-03 19:30:48	elly	without you having to learn to use Android's UI toolkit or UIKit
2022-03-03 19:30:53	natalia	mm
2022-03-03 19:31:08	nihilazo	the problem I have with linux
2022-03-03 19:31:10	nihilazo	well, one of the many
2022-03-03 19:31:17	nihilazo	is just how much the linux world love fragmentation
2022-03-03 19:31:40	nihilazo	and whenever somebody complains about fragmentation, the solution is a new thing that causes more fragmentation between new thing and old thing
2022-03-03 19:31:46	natalia	yeah my thing here mostly is, i am heavily inspired by how tiddlywiki works well on mobile devices if you have it on a webdav server or similar, which also a native app could maybe shimmy support for
2022-03-03 19:31:56	nihilazo	I do want to try out tiddlywiki sometime
2022-03-03 19:32:02	nihilazo	it's a very interesting program
2022-03-03 19:32:23	elly	nihilazo: yeah, it's not great
2022-03-03 19:32:38	elly	there is not really a group that sets strong direction for how Linux desktop systems behave - FD.o is very mechanism-not-policy mostly
2022-03-03 19:33:07	natalia	regrettably i don't think there is a great way to make something as *obvious* as a cgi app than as a single file thing, while also making it portable to smaller devices like i want
2022-03-03 19:33:10	natalia	so that's sort of a tradeoff
2022-03-03 19:33:29	natalia	like telling someone "oh just run a cgi server on your phone", lmao
2022-03-03 19:33:32	natalia	but also the target here is me :P
2022-03-03 19:33:53	elly	natalia: in-process web server + webview :o
2022-03-03 19:33:58	natalia	(not actually using cgi for implementation reasons)
2022-03-03 19:34:08	natalia	elly: hm?
2022-03-03 19:34:18	natalia	yeha like i think it could probably be achieved on mobile just not as easy to deploy or like, sync up
2022-03-03 19:34:22	elly	oh yeah
2022-03-03 19:34:25	nihilazo	elly: yeah. I think the linux desktop needs a policy-making organisation. But everybody would hate that because creating a coherent OS is against freedom or whatever
2022-03-03 19:34:54	nihilazo	like, at the same time I get both sides here, I want a system that isn't fragmented and shit to develop for
2022-03-03 19:35:06	natalia	tbf tiddlywiki is also nontrivial on android as it is
2022-03-03 19:35:12	nihilazo	but I also understand how users like being able to pick from 500 desktop environments and get angry at each other for making the "wrong" choice
2022-03-03 19:35:16	natalia	like, if you don't have a server, you have to save a copy over itself, which is like, pretty easy but also a pita
2022-03-03 19:36:02	elly	nihilazo: well, also, people have strong opinions and there's no way that you could actually get the various distros to agree with you
2022-03-03 19:37:22	elly	there's no like... "place" in the ecosystem that anyone could impose such a standard
2022-03-03 19:39:21	nihilazo	yeah
2022-03-03 19:39:31	nihilazo	you'd need to start from scratch if you wanted to do that, really
2022-03-03 19:39:34	nihilazo	with a new everything
2022-03-03 19:39:57	elly	you would just be creating the n+1th option
2022-03-03 19:40:03	nihilazo	yeah
2022-03-03 19:40:21	dusted	at my previous place of work, i made a prototype on android where users could define the layout of their apps, so the app came with one or two suggested layouts, but people were free to start from scratch and chose from the palette of input and outputs and arrange them as they saw fit
2022-03-03 19:40:41	nihilazo	what seems to be happening more is people writing software "for GNOME", "for KDE" etc
2022-03-03 19:41:05	nihilazo	which means that your environment is cohesive, as long as you're using all GNOME stuff or all KDE stuff, if you mix the two it's even more of a mess
2022-03-03 19:41:07	natalia	dusted: that sounds nice
2022-03-03 19:41:22	nihilazo	especially with GNOME doing their own UX thing compared to other DEs
2022-03-03 19:41:22	dusted	natalia: it was terrible :D something only a poweruser could appreciate
2022-03-03 19:41:42	natalia	huh, i wonder if you could deploy cqueues and stuff on mobile devices
2022-03-03 19:43:38	trashski	!tarot
2022-03-03 19:43:38	rufus[awkbot]	The Nine of Cups (Reversed) - lack of inner joy, smugness, dissatisfaction

2022-03-03 19:44:16	rufus[awkbot]	Temperance (Reversed) - extremes, excess, lack of balance
2022-03-03 19:44:42	dusted	gui stuff is hard for so many reasons
2022-03-03 19:45:45	elly	ya
2022-03-03 19:46:01	dzwdz	> <nihilazo> it would be nice if linux had an actual native UI toolkit instead of a million different shitty ones all pretending to be a native UI toolkit
2022-03-03 19:46:04	dzwdz	linux is a kernel
2022-03-03 19:46:10	dzwdz	please don't put gui in the fucking kernel
2022-03-03 19:46:24	dzwdz	s/gui/gui frameworks
2022-03-03 19:46:25	sedbot	<dzwdz> please don't put gui frameworks in the fucking kernel
2022-03-03 19:46:44	nihilazo	I mean "linux" as in "the linux desktop"
2022-03-03 19:46:58	dzwdz	which means "desktop systems which happen to be using linux"
2022-03-03 19:47:00	nihilazo	i mean the operating system commonly known as linux
2022-03-03 19:47:11	dzwdz	there's no single one
2022-03-03 19:47:21	dzwdz	if you used all windows apps and all mac apps on the same pc
2022-03-03 19:47:25	dzwdz	they'd be a mess too
2022-03-03 19:47:27	dzwdz	but you can't do that
2022-03-03 19:47:48	dzwdz	just because you can mix gnome and kde doesn't mean that either is bad
2022-03-03 19:48:05	dzwdz	i agree that the linux desktop is a mess, though
2022-03-03 19:48:12	dusted	I became immune to the differences between gtk and qt a long time ago, I don't even skin them anymore
2022-03-03 19:48:23	dusted	they can just be their own quirky selves, adn I don't care
2022-03-03 19:49:39	dzwdz	speaking of the linux desktop
2022-03-03 19:49:48	dzwdz	i just had to restart every audio application including the browser
2022-03-03 19:50:06	dusted	I get that with pulseaudio some times
2022-03-03 19:50:12	nihilazo	I personally use a gtk based DE so I guess my best GUI programming option is GTK
2022-03-03 19:50:19	nihilazo	but GTK is also kinda a mess to work with
2022-03-03 19:50:32	dzwdz	terminal good
2022-03-03 19:50:38	elly	so's everything else - just pick one you can handle and practice with it
2022-03-03 19:50:54	elly	it is vastly better to pick an okay toolkit and commit to it enough to learn it than to constantly try new ones and never learn any of them
2022-03-03 19:50:58	nihilazo	that's true
2022-03-03 19:51:00	dzwdz	but i swear if you make a terminal app which emulates GUI, i'm going to become illegible for the axemurder license
2022-03-03 19:51:23	dusted	I use i3 so I don't have to worry about apps looking "native" to it
2022-03-03 19:51:30	dzwdz	i sure do love when programs reimplement the scrollback buffer in a shitty way
2022-03-03 19:51:33	nihilazo	I think I'm gonna learn gtk if I want to make GUI stuff that's ""native""
2022-03-03 19:51:48	nihilazo	but rn the thing I'm building is for a weird VM with its own graphics stack so
2022-03-03 19:51:48	nihilazo	lol
2022-03-03 19:52:08	elly	if that meets your needs go for it
2022-03-03 19:52:16	dzwdz	i kinda want to write a cad program
2022-03-03 19:52:31	dzwdz	i've had this idea for a source engine map editor for a long time
2022-03-03 19:52:49	elly	go for it! it's probably super fun
2022-03-03 19:52:58	dzwdz	i have no clue what framework to use
2022-03-03 19:53:14	dzwdz	my internet here is so fucking shit
2022-03-03 19:53:23	dzwdz	ircing over ssh over bad connections is hard
2022-03-03 19:53:24	elly	it depends what platforms you care about your code running on
2022-03-03 19:53:27	nihilazo	elly: I'm not sure if it meets my needs, but I'm building an editor for something that targets said weird VM
2022-03-03 19:53:30	dusted	dzwdz: is sdl2 too low level for what you want to do ?
2022-03-03 19:53:33	nihilazo	so it makes sense that the editor should run on it
2022-03-03 19:53:35	dzwdz	idk
2022-03-03 19:53:45	dzwdz	i'm lowkey considering js
2022-03-03 19:53:47	dusted	handles mouse/keyboard, let's you draw to the screen
2022-03-03 19:53:59	dzwdz	this would be more of a PoC than anything
2022-03-03 19:54:06	elly	that's *all* SDL does, though :) building an actual UI out of it is pretty involved
2022-03-03 19:54:19	nihilazo	yeah
2022-03-03 19:54:20	elly	you get to / have to make up your own UI controls and implement them
2022-03-03 19:55:07	dusted	elly: true, I've done a half-baked gui on top of sdl and opengl
2022-03-03 19:56:08	dusted	you can probably implement the first versions of autocad as a single html file with the js embedded and it'd run with no backend :D
2022-03-03 19:56:22	dzwdz	i've been kinda meaning to make an old windows inspired WM
2022-03-03 19:56:28	dzwdz	which could be pixel-perfect
2022-03-03 19:56:46	dzwdz	that age of ui design was seriously a big vibe
2022-03-03 19:56:50	natalia	hmm, i wonder if i could come up with any good systems for uh
2022-03-03 19:57:11	natalia	well obviously the thing about listening as web on localhost is it's insecure on multi-user systems without password auth
2022-03-03 19:57:16	natalia	but i wonder if there are any Cool Ways To Do That (TM)
2022-03-03 19:57:22	dzwdz	unix sockets?
2022-03-03 19:57:32	dzwdz	oh wait, web browsers don't support them
2022-03-03 19:57:34	dzwdz	i think
2022-03-03 19:57:35	natalia	i want people to actually be able to use their web browser yeah
2022-03-03 19:57:43	natalia	i considered it but i believe it's impossible
2022-03-03 19:58:48	dzwdz	i wish browsers had native pubkey auth shit
2022-03-03 19:59:17	elly	webauthn?
2022-03-03 19:59:32	elly	or webcrypto I guess
2022-03-03 19:59:55	dzwdz	doesn't webauthn require special hardware
2022-03-03 20:00:03	dusted	oh, there's Xvfb on tilde? :D

2022-03-03 21:09:18	@vilmibm	hi default , elly
2022-03-03 21:09:22	@vilmibm	indeed, itch is v good
2022-03-03 21:10:09	default	i meant pirated games, but ok
2022-03-03 21:10:28	default	really want to try ms flight simulator specifically, don't want to fork over $60 with no refunds.
2022-03-03 21:10:37	elly	ah
2022-03-03 21:11:03	@vilmibm	oh i don't know how to pirate games anymore
2022-03-03 21:11:05	@vilmibm	pirate bay?

2022-03-03 21:13:30	elly	yeah, I too have no idea what one does for pirating software in 2022
2022-03-03 21:15:54	nihilazo	I havn't pirated software in so long
2022-03-03 21:16:09	elly	at some point Steam got really good at what it does and I ceased bothering I think
2022-03-03 21:16:44	nihilazo	I either just use free stuff
2022-03-03 21:16:52	nihilazo	or for games, I play indie stuff where I want to support the devs
2022-03-03 21:16:58	nihilazo	so I buy it from itch
2022-03-03 21:17:07	elly	yea
2022-03-03 21:17:15	nihilazo	(or steam if it's on sale, which I know is less good for the devs, but cheaper and still gets some money to them)
2022-03-03 21:19:28	@vilmibm	i became an adult with freedom and, thankfully, money
2022-03-03 21:19:38	@vilmibm	so i haven't pirated anything since like 2007
2022-03-03 21:21:25	elly	yea
2022-03-03 21:21:29	elly	same basically
2022-03-03 21:21:41	elly	but also it did get a lot easier to buy stuff without pirating it
2022-03-03 21:21:57	@vilmibm	no more driving to the mall to go to Electronic Boutique
2022-03-03 21:22:11	@vilmibm	or out to a stripmall to the Gamestop
2022-03-03 21:22:28	elly	lol yeah
2022-03-03 21:22:36	elly	"oh sorry we sold out all 6 copies"
2022-03-03 21:22:47	m455	i do miss the hype of being on the way home, waiting for the travel home to end to play a new game
2022-03-03 21:22:52	@vilmibm	i remember being like 13 and having saved up $60 allowance and going to Media Play to pick out a new game
2022-03-03 21:22:58	m455	LOL same
2022-03-03 21:23:11	@vilmibm	literally browing shelves to make a decision
2022-03-03 21:23:24	m455	pc games in a cool looking box
2022-03-03 21:23:37	m455	console games were always behind the glass
2022-03-03 21:23:49	elly	yeah
2022-03-03 21:23:53	elly	with empty cases on the shelves
2022-03-03 21:23:58	m455	xD yeah
2022-03-03 21:23:58	elly	and you'd get one and bring it to the counter
2022-03-03 21:24:22	@vilmibm	UNFORTUNATELY for me i went with "Star Wars Force Commander"
2022-03-03 21:24:25	@vilmibm	on that one trip to media play
2022-03-03 21:24:32	elly	oh no
2022-03-03 21:24:33	@vilmibm	force commander was not a good game!
2022-03-03 21:24:39	@vilmibm	i felt VERY upset
2022-03-03 21:24:45	elly	my best ever EB Games impulse buy game was Advance Wars
2022-03-03 21:24:48	elly	which was, admittedly, great
2022-03-03 21:24:50	m455	oh fuck saving up and buying games i didn't like was so shitty, i remmeber that lol
2022-03-03 21:24:52	@vilmibm	i kept playing to make the $60, at the time an unfathomable quantity, feel worth it
2022-03-03 21:24:59	m455	elly: ouuu yeah when gameboy advanced came out
2022-03-03 21:24:59	elly	m455: that's why game review magazines existed!
2022-03-03 21:24:59	@vilmibm	elly: omg yes me too!!
2022-03-03 21:25:03	@vilmibm	i got that on a whim and loved it
2022-03-03 21:25:07	elly	remember reading GamePro?
2022-03-03 21:25:10	@vilmibm	damn i loved my GBA
2022-03-03 21:25:12	elly	inventors of protips!
2022-03-03 21:25:16	m455	elly: i had to travel to another city to get them hahaha
2022-03-03 21:25:17	@vilmibm	yes for sure, i only got it intermittently though
2022-03-03 21:25:32	m455	i liked the game cheat magazines that mny town had though!!
2022-03-03 21:26:18	elly	haha yes
2022-03-03 21:26:33	elly	man, nostalgia mode
2022-03-03 21:26:37	m455	hahaha yeah
2022-03-03 21:26:56	default	back. and i've never pirated a game before. but in this case it's a) $60 b) has no refunds (as the launcher that downloads the game counts as playtime) and c) is developed by microsoft
2022-03-03 21:27:02	default	if i like it i'll buy it
2022-03-03 21:27:15	m455	man the games i spent the most time on, on gameboy color (i never had the original grey gameboys), was zelda links awakening, pokemon red, pokemon yellow, and pokemon silver, and i borrowed my half brother's tetris
2022-03-03 21:27:30	elly	duuude
2022-03-03 21:27:34	default	gotta make me feel so young
2022-03-03 21:27:35	@vilmibm	my wife and i came very close to buying a used video game store in los angeles
2022-03-03 21:27:36	elly	Pokemon Blue on my Game Boy Pocket
2022-03-03 21:27:39	elly	maxed out level 100 team over here
2022-03-03 21:27:44	elly	I sunk so many hours into that
2022-03-03 21:27:46	@vilmibm	the owner offered it for $200k and my money advisor was like "fuck it dude go for it"
2022-03-03 21:28:04	@vilmibm	the place is a veritable museum and had huge stacks of magazines, we bought a bunch of PC Gamer issues
2022-03-03 21:28:08	elly	wow
2022-03-03 21:28:28	@vilmibm	we decided not to because it was a chaotic dusty mess and there was no way to verify what the storied "back room of rare stuff" had
2022-03-03 21:28:51	m455	elly: hahah hell yeah i spent SO much time on it. i managed to get all legendary pokemon on silver, and my friend managed to get mew on his pokemon blue without hacking it. there was ONE legit tutorial, he even showed me how he did it in person. back then people thought you had to hack it, and i think nowadays people sitll do
2022-03-03 21:28:55	@vilmibm	he trotted out a Hideo Kojima signed copy of like MGS3 as an example of where the "real value" was and i was like i donno dude
2022-03-03 21:29:04	m455	hahahahha wow
2022-03-03 21:29:08	elly	m455: you can missingno glitch to get it, no?
2022-03-03 21:29:27	m455	elly: i dont remember if missingo was used, but the pokeflute was used, and that's all i remmeber lol
2022-03-03 21:29:38	m455	i wouldn't be surprised if you could use missingo
2022-03-03 21:29:38	@vilmibm	i was also a pokemon blue kid, stayed up late with a flashlight under the covers with my OG gameboy playing it. i did eventually get a gameboy color from my aunt with disposable income
2022-03-03 21:29:56	m455	ohh i forgot about flashlights
2022-03-03 21:30:09	m455	i always had a set of rechargible batteries with me too hahaha

2022-03-03 21:30:23	elly	m455: that sounds like another famous glitch
2022-03-03 21:30:26	elly	(the poke flute use)
2022-03-03 21:30:40	elly	actual vibes of games just having glitches that existed forever because they were never updated
2022-03-03 21:30:50	m455	elly: i think it was a glitch yeah! something to do with overloading snorlax with mew or something
2022-03-03 21:31:13	m455	when i first saw mew my heart like dropped hahahah. it was the most unbelievable thing to me at that time hahaha
2022-03-03 21:31:35	m455	he's like check it out, it can use transform and teleport or whatever it was and yeah it was just wild
2022-03-03 21:31:53	m455	but yeah, i was OBSESSED with pokemon red, yellow, and less-so silver, even though it was also equally as good
2022-03-03 21:32:00	m455	i haven't played any pokemon games since lol
2022-03-03 21:32:02	elly	yeah
2022-03-03 21:32:04	elly	oh gosh
2022-03-03 21:32:12	elly	I played Brilliant Diamond and now am playing Legends Arceus
2022-03-03 21:32:19	elly	they are basically all the same game they were before though
2022-03-03 21:32:21	m455	damnnn those wild names
2022-03-03 21:32:23	m455	that's really awesome!
2022-03-03 21:33:08	@vilmibm	i was into blue and yellow
2022-03-03 21:33:24	@vilmibm	never really put any time into a pokemon after that. enjoyed Snap at a friend's house tho
2022-03-03 21:33:38	m455	oh fuck pokemon snap was a friend's house thing for me too!
2022-03-03 21:33:39	m455	it was so fun
2022-03-03 21:33:47	m455	that, in combination with breaks to play super smash brothers
2022-03-03 21:34:06	m455	damn i am getting memories back that i forgot i had
2022-03-03 21:34:12	@vilmibm	N64 and playstation and snes were all "friend's house" things for me. i only have gameboy until my house got a PC
2022-03-03 21:34:16	m455	like just that friend's house in general i totally forgot about
2022-03-03 21:34:38	@vilmibm	the only physical SNES i think i've ever played was sunset riders at a friend's house in elementary school
2022-03-03 21:34:53	m455	ohhhh i had n64 and super nintendo, and my half brother has nes and sega genesis, and then we found a sega master system at the flea market that came with three games
2022-03-03 21:35:00	m455	OMG the cowboy oen!
2022-03-03 21:35:02	m455	that was so fun hahaha
2022-03-03 21:35:07	m455	and very very hard
2022-03-03 21:35:18	@vilmibm	yes so hard
2022-03-03 21:35:29	m455	vilmibm: had you ever played super mario RPG?
2022-03-03 21:35:43	@vilmibm	yes, extensively, via an emulator. never beat it though
2022-03-03 21:35:51	m455	i think to this day, (shit i think i told you this already), it's still one of my favourite rpgs along with morrowind elders scrolls III
2022-03-03 21:35:54	m455	ohhhh
2022-03-03 21:36:13	@vilmibm	my Awful Ex would not allow me to play video games unless they were emulated mario, megaman, or sonic games so for a few years i was playing a lot of the first two. i was and still am awful at 2d sonic
2022-03-03 21:36:22	m455	(work has like a thursday end of day conference every week so i am chatting here lol)
2022-03-03 21:36:39	m455	aww shit
2022-03-03 21:40:44	extratone	that's no good.
2022-03-03 21:41:29	elly	yeah, we are having a work summit too so I am posting more heavily than usual
2022-03-03 21:41:45	elly	right now there are a bunch of discussion groups going but I am in none of them and am instead acquiring sunlight and writing
2022-03-03 21:43:03	natalia	iydm what are you writing about?
2022-03-03 21:43:14	elly	ah, writing a trip report for this trip
2022-03-03 21:43:16	elly	nothing super interesting
2022-03-03 21:44:04	natalia	how do you approach writing generally? i've been trying to figure out what things acutally work for me (noticing i tend to productively write more on paper is a simple one but it's definitely there)
2022-03-03 21:44:07	@vilmibm	https://twitter.com/gifs_bot/status/1499494833471295488/photo/1
2022-03-03 21:44:26	natalia	although that's harder to translate to like, more technical writing stuff because it's just harder to do that usefully without a lot of references
2022-03-03 21:44:34	elly	natalia: I make an outline and then write the text I guess, it's hard to know how to answer :P
2022-03-03 21:45:41	natalia	understandable lol
2022-03-03 21:46:05	elly	I love writing and practice it often is the real answer
2022-03-03 21:46:14	elly	same as being comfortable at any other skill, practice
2022-03-03 21:47:10	natalia	mm
2022-03-03 21:50:49	elly	I just love outlining, I write very iteratively
2022-03-03 21:50:55	elly	and the outline is easier to edit
2022-03-03 21:53:28	extratone	I have gotten so bad at that.
2022-03-03 21:55:15	elly	at writing?
2022-03-03 21:57:24	natalia	i have been spending time recently trying to more actively study writing i actually like and also unlearn almost everything i learned in school
2022-03-03 21:57:27	natalia	hs composition is **so bad**
2022-03-03 21:57:39	natalia	or at least what i learned from

2022-03-03 21:58:53	extratone	at outlining, specifically. but yeah writing too lol
2022-03-03 22:07:21	elly	the outline is when I do most of my actual writing
2022-03-03 22:07:29	elly	since that's when I order my thoughts and turn them into a coherent whatever
2022-03-03 22:07:36	elly	and make sure my point makes sense and so on
2022-03-03 22:07:45	elly	then the writing is a process of adding words to that :)

2022-03-04 17:02:48	owl	I prefer rainy/cloudy weather generally so LA is definitely not for me. anyone who wants 350+ days a year of sun is suspicious imo

2022-03-04 17:43:41	dozens	extratone: yeah never.. unless i happen to see a bottle of compressed air lying around

2022-03-04 17:44:16	extratone	how often is that? I'm asking largely because I'm pretty sure my hands must be grosser than normal humans.
2022-03-04 17:44:38	extratone	I clean mine like three times a day at least.
2022-03-04 17:44:52	dozens	wat

2022-03-04 17:45:09	extratone	same! I think I must just be icky :(
2022-03-04 17:45:51	extratone	I asked some iPad Pro users for this and only one answered lol. https://bilge.world/apple-polishing-cloth
2022-03-04 17:46:10	extratone	screens, though.
2022-03-04 17:46:30	owl	man I hate touch screens
2022-03-04 17:46:36	owl	nothing worse than finger grease on your display
2022-03-04 17:46:58	owl	I also wash my hands before returning to work on my computer and tend to clean my keyboard once a week-ish
2022-03-04 17:47:07	extratone	I know right! like I detailed in that piece... I was taught... not to touch the screen.
2022-03-04 17:47:30	extratone	that sounds like the reasonable rate for normal humans, owl.
2022-03-04 17:47:35	extratone	I love your username btw.

2022-03-04 17:51:34	dzwdz	said the owl
2022-03-04 17:51:36	dzwdz	kinda biased
2022-03-04 17:52:40	extratone	my dad inadvertently caused the death of an owl (I grew up on a farm) and acted like it was the most dangerous crime. 
2022-03-04 17:53:04	extratone	terrified of retribution. looking back, I think "good."
2022-03-04 17:53:17	extratone	protect owls at all cost.

2022-03-04 18:05:39	dozens	i just finished reading a book called the owl service. it was about owls, kind of
2022-03-04 18:06:55	dozens	there's a lot of death symbolism wrapped up in owls. i wonder if he was feeling superstitious about it.
2022-03-04 18:07:29	dozens	wait extratone you have a resident owl? like an owl that lives with you?

2022-03-04 18:22:59	the_default	ok now it's down to 1.16

2022-03-04 18:27:12	the_default	yes. and the locked settings on the router. they literally sell a buisness model, same hardware, same software, but lock out features because why would home users ever need them?
2022-03-04 18:27:25	the_default	want to run a modem only? tough luck.
2022-03-04 18:27:26	extratone	dozens, no sorry, just one that lives in the yard.
2022-03-04 18:27:29	dzwdz	you do realize why they do that, right
2022-03-04 18:28:01	dozens	well, that's nice anyway
2022-03-04 18:28:15	the_default	yes, it makes customer support far easier?
2022-03-04 18:28:23	the_default	that was a yes?
2022-03-04 18:28:25	dzwdz	it gets people like you to switch to the business plan

2022-03-04 18:43:50	extratone	I would imagine heating elements are quite a bit more efficient than resistors but
2022-03-04 18:44:08	extratone	I suppose that depends on how much you value crypto.

2022-03-04 18:45:34	dzwdz	extratone: i clean it every few months? when it feels dirty i gues

2022-03-04 18:57:48	dzwdz	trying it out
2022-03-04 18:58:03	@vilmibm	i switched to ddg at some point and kind of forgot
2022-03-04 18:58:06	@vilmibm	because it never pisses me off
2022-03-04 18:58:23	m455	yeah same lol
2022-03-04 18:58:25	dzwdz	i still have !g when there are no useful results
2022-03-04 18:58:27	dzwdz	so
2022-03-04 18:58:30	m455	i switch between duckduckgo and qwant.com
2022-03-04 18:58:52	m455	i like how good qwant.com behaves when i add mandatory things like +"this is" +"required"
2022-03-04 18:59:03	dzwdz	i like duckduckgo because it's popular
2022-03-04 18:59:06	m455	some days it's slow or randomly down but yeah lol
2022-03-04 18:59:07	dzwdz	my searches drown in the noise

2022-03-04 19:05:10	owl	personally I think the days of the dirty-G being a useful web search engine are over
2022-03-04 19:05:29	owl	it's a good "answers engine", like type a question and usually get an answer
2022-03-04 19:05:36	dzwdz	too much seo spam
2022-03-04 19:05:39	owl	what's the weather, food near me, what's the name of that thing, etc.
2022-03-04 19:05:45	dzwdz	i'd love a curated search engine

2022-03-04 19:11:53	nihilazo	never realised how different the german and english lyrics were
2022-03-04 19:15:09	nihilazo	german version: 99 balloons released as a UFO hoax, one country sends the air force to shoot them down as a show of power, a neighbor misunderstands and shoots back, war ensues that destroys the world
2022-03-04 19:16:21	nihilazo	english version: some balloons show up as missiles on an early warning system, there's some talk about an army scrambling but the entire war is just implied until the final verse talks about a city being destroyed
2022-03-04 19:16:28	nihilazo	rather than explicit
2022-03-04 19:16:30	nihilazo	anyways, good song
2022-03-04 19:19:19	dzwdz	ok WHAT
2022-03-04 19:19:24	extratone	really wish I'd stuck with German long enough to listen to the original in its entirety now.
2022-03-04 19:19:28	dzwdz	i searched "gay" in my spotify library and there are only two hits
2022-03-04 19:20:47	dzwdz	i'm disappointed
2022-03-04 19:22:32	nihilazo	extratone: the video has more literally translated english subtitles
2022-03-04 19:22:40	nihilazo	that's what I'm going based on. I don't speak almost any german.
2022-03-04 19:35:01	extratone	I appreciate that but I mean *really* hear it in the language.
2022-03-04 19:35:06	extratone	just being pretentious.
2022-03-04 19:40:27	dusted	I'm watching a youtube livestream at 2x speed to hope to catch up to it being live, that's the first time I've had any use of that feature

2022-03-04 20:32:24	extratone	this is old but still good, I’m told. I’d love to hear what y’all think. https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts
2022-03-04 20:33:57	extratone	the preview image - of a Google employee wearing an early Google Glass prototype - should be worth it, if nothing else.
2022-03-04 20:42:10	elly	oh man, I remember Glass
2022-03-04 20:42:16	elly	my wife had one of the late prototypes and wore it a lot
2022-03-04 20:44:55	dzwdz	was it still one of the dumb looking ones?
2022-03-04 20:45:11	nihilazo	I remember thinking glass was so cool and being hyped for it when it was new
2022-03-04 20:45:26	dzwdz	o shit, they're still a thing
2022-03-04 20:45:31	dzwdz	i thought that they discontinued them
2022-03-04 20:45:31	nihilazo	and then just kinda forgetting about it untill the articles like "what happened to glass???" came out
2022-03-04 20:45:38	nihilazo	it's a specialist thing now iirc
2022-03-04 20:45:42	nihilazo	rather than a massmarket product
2022-03-04 20:45:57	elly	from a certain perspective all of them look dumb :P
2022-03-04 20:46:13	elly	and yeah they do still exist but the market shifted from "tech nerds in the bay area" to "people who actually need a heads-up display for work"

2022-03-04 20:46:36	dzwdz	the baby doesn't buy this shit
2022-03-04 20:47:21	elly	wild, I wonder what that did

2022-03-04 20:47:55	elly	it literally just gives you a HUD / video calling capability while you are using both hands to breastfeed
2022-03-04 20:48:05	dzwdz	...come on
2022-03-04 20:48:20	dzwdz	like i can't call via my phone
2022-03-04 20:48:46	elly	using a phone with both hands occupied is legitimately hard if you are also wrangling a child
2022-03-04 20:48:51	elly	especially if you want video
2022-03-04 20:49:07	dzwdz	i never breastfed so
2022-03-04 20:49:17	dzwdz	i guess so
2022-03-04 20:49:35	elly	extratone: my real question is who the heck is "Dirty Dave"
2022-03-04 20:49:48	dzwdz	opinions on smartwatches?
2022-03-04 20:49:59	dzwdz	i feel like this lands in vaguely the same area
2022-03-04 20:51:29	elly	I have what one might consider a smartwatch
2022-03-04 20:52:18	elly	namely this: https://www.fitbit.com/global/en-ca/products/trackers/charge4
2022-03-04 20:52:20	elly	I quite like it
2022-03-04 20:54:13	dzwdz	fitness watches are sensible
2022-03-04 20:54:24	dzwdz	i can definitely see the value if you run a lot or something like that
2022-03-04 20:54:29	elly	I do indeed
2022-03-04 20:54:30	dzwdz	but i'm talking SMARTwatches
2022-03-04 20:54:42	dzwdz	with a proper display, apps, notifications, etc
2022-03-04 20:55:42	extratone	elly dirty dave is me at certain times.
2022-03-04 20:56:41	elly	oh wow
2022-03-04 20:57:31	dzwdz	i (sadly) don't run myself so i'm just a fan of traditional digital watches
2022-03-04 20:58:10	elly	mine definitely does some smartwatch-y stuff, like control media playing on my phone
2022-03-04 20:58:50	dzwdz	do you have to charge it often?
2022-03-04 20:59:00	dzwdz	to me that seems like the single biggest issue with smartwatches
2022-03-04 20:59:01	elly	once a week generally
2022-03-04 20:59:23	dzwdz	ain't so bad
2022-03-04 21:00:54	dzwdz	even i would probably remember to keep it charged
2022-03-04 21:06:16	twee	o/
2022-03-04 21:06:19	dzwdz	\o
2022-03-04 21:06:25	twee	wow that was speedy
2022-03-04 21:06:33	twee	i installed freebsd today

2022-03-04 21:06:54	twee	how are you
2022-03-04 21:07:00	dzwdz	eduroam sounds like a pain in the ass
2022-03-04 21:07:08	dzwdz	i'm mostly fine, i came back from the hospital today
2022-03-04 21:09:38	twee	everything good ?
2022-03-04 21:09:42	dzwdz	yeah
2022-03-04 21:09:59	dzwdz	i'm not sure if you were here when i was talking about the anaesthetic, but it went very well
2022-03-04 21:10:20	twee	honestly it's mostly fine, and my uni fixed their system to make it work better recently.  issue is freebsd has strange certificate names and i couldn't be bothered with that
2022-03-04 21:10:32	twee	i believe i might have been?  but also maybe not.  it rings a bell, glad it went well
2022-03-04 21:10:33	dzwdz	i have to wait a few weeks for my MRI results, but the others are great
2022-03-04 21:11:01	dzwdz	my colon is apparently "shiny"
2022-03-04 21:11:25	dzwdz	which also apparently is good
2022-03-04 21:13:34	twee	like shiny pokemen
2022-03-04 21:13:35	twee	good
2022-03-04 21:15:16	the_default	do *not* capture dzwdz's colon

2022-03-04 21:56:43	twee	but thunderbird is absolutely mediocre at best

2022-03-04 21:59:55	twee	i hate that that's a special feature

2022-03-04 22:03:19	cymen	Does gmail not speak imap anymore?

2022-03-04 22:03:23	twee	idk
2022-03-04 22:03:27	twee	i think they claim to
2022-03-04 22:03:33	twee	but it just stopped working for me a while back
2022-03-04 22:03:40	elly	gmail does speak imap
2022-03-04 22:03:43	twee	they've been pushing their "secure apps" thing for a while
2022-03-04 22:03:43	elly	I use mutt with it regularly
2022-03-04 22:03:58	elly	I don't really know what thunderbird means by having gmail support tbh
2022-03-04 22:04:06	twee	google don't want gmail to speak imap, and it's no longer the default for business google afaik
2022-03-04 22:04:13	twee	(at least that's what i've been told by uni tech support)
2022-03-04 22:04:22	twee	and for security reasons they are not allowing imap connections
2022-03-04 22:04:28	elly	yea
2022-03-04 22:04:39	elly	they presumably want to push people towards HTTPS auth, which can use 2factor
2022-03-04 22:04:54	elly	domain admins can disable use of app-specific passwords domain wide and a lot want to
2022-03-04 22:05:11	twee	when i sign into gmail using thunderbird, it takes me to a google page to confirm my account with 2fa and all, and then comes up under allowed applications or something in google account security, like via an api or something
2022-03-04 22:05:18	twee	idk
2022-03-04 22:05:18	dzwdz	just please let me use pubkeys for my email, ugh
2022-03-04 22:05:26	dzwdz	i mean for logging in
2022-03-04 22:05:31	elly	twee: ah, it's using oauth to log in
2022-03-04 22:05:35	elly	that is probably what they mean by support
2022-03-04 22:05:46	elly	mutt can't do that so I have to use an ASP with it
2022-03-04 22:05:47	twee	all i knwo is that i was happily using gmail with imap, and then it stopped working everywhere at once, and now i can't anymore
2022-03-04 22:06:05	twee	elly: what's an asp?
2022-03-04 22:06:27	elly	app-specific password
2022-03-04 22:06:46	elly	the old pre-oauth way of doing app authentication
2022-03-04 22:06:51	twee	ah
2022-03-04 22:07:26	twee	well for now i'll just stick with thunderbird and whatever it does to make it work
2022-03-04 22:07:37	elly	working is the best feature :)
2022-03-04 22:08:04	twee	indeed it is
2022-03-04 22:08:10	twee	working well is the dream though
2022-03-04 22:09:30	elly	yeah
2022-03-04 22:10:06	elly	unfortunately email clients other than the actual gmail app, even if they do work properly with gmail, usually don't have some of its other features and integrations
2022-03-04 22:10:28	twee	thats true
2022-03-04 22:10:39	twee	i basically only use inbox and reply though so
2022-03-04 22:11:22	elly	valid
2022-03-04 22:11:33	extratone	I thought jailbreaking was supposed to be simple? especially on old devices. 
2022-03-04 22:11:39	elly	I use the thing where you can reply to Docs comments directly from in Gmail a *lot*
2022-03-04 22:11:53	elly	extratone: depends on the device but generally yes
2022-03-04 22:12:03	twee	i didn't know that was a thing, but then i don't use docs much
2022-03-04 22:12:35	twee	i just have a personal and a uni email address and use them at the most basic level
2022-03-04 22:12:50	extratone	I'm like 4 failed methods in on a 4S with iOS 9.3.6 lol
2022-03-04 22:13:24	elly	ha, that's actually old enough you might have a hard time finding one that still runs
2022-03-04 22:14:25	extratone	I don't suppose there's any other method of reveritng iOS versions is there?
2022-03-04 22:14:45	extratone	that's all I'm tryna do.
2022-03-04 22:15:32	elly	like, going back to an older version?
2022-03-04 22:15:43	extratone	yes. 
2022-03-04 22:16:20	extratone	I found a few on Reddit but they seem even more complex.

2022-03-04 22:48:15	extratone	is it worth putting up a forum thread for other iOS users and how I use Town from my phone?

2022-03-04 23:00:24	extratone	okay :) I don't suppose bbj supports markdown.
2022-03-04 23:15:16	amcclure	fuck whoever reported antonmcclure.com to fortinet's fortiguard labs web filter as "spam urls", and fuck fortinet for not verifying before listing it as such
2022-03-04 23:18:38	dzwdz	does it say it's been a report?
2022-03-04 23:18:52	dzwdz	maybe it just got randomly flagged for some reason
2022-03-04 23:21:02	nihilazo	it's almost midnight, I should go to sleep
2022-03-04 23:21:13	nihilazo	oooor I don't go to sleep and instead lie in tomorrow instead of going out
2022-03-04 23:21:16	nihilazo	but I want to go out tomorrow

2022-03-04 23:21:30	dzwdz	nighty
2022-03-04 23:31:20	amcclure	2 freemium scans said there are 2 malware files that I need to sign up to see information on, and everything else I tried showed nothing malicious
2022-03-04 23:48:19	amcclure	I'm just going to change everyone's password to be on the safe side
2022-03-04 23:57:01	amcclure	could they be false positives?
2022-03-04 23:57:26	amcclure	or has a domain I linked to in a blog post gone bad? o_o

2022-03-05 03:33:27	malvarma	natalia: derek bailey has a guitar, he did not play guitar, he used guitar to play nonguitar
2022-03-05 03:33:49	malvarma	there are some more drum / bass heavy fusioney albums he is on though, u might like them better
2022-03-05 03:33:59	josh	going to gue gym is good
2022-03-05 03:34:02	josh	*fur
2022-03-05 03:34:03	josh	*gur
2022-03-05 03:34:10	josh	damn i can't type apparently
2022-03-05 03:34:35	bx	\o/ ive infected someone with gur
2022-03-05 03:34:44	natalia	malvarma: wonderful
2022-03-05 03:34:52	natalia	i am curious about those albums though
2022-03-05 03:35:04	natalia	music and dance is cool but not quite the mood presently
2022-03-05 03:35:05	bx	josh: typing is overrated, long as gur message arrives intact it works
2022-03-05 03:35:05	malvarma	wont be long before teachers in school scold kids who incorrectly use "the"
2022-03-05 03:35:16	josh	oh oops my keyboad was stuck in rot13 mode, just fixed it
2022-03-05 03:35:45	bx	josh: yoooo
2022-03-05 03:35:51	bx	that needs to be a thing
2022-03-05 03:35:53	malvarma	natalia: had a feeling. it's an album for a very specific mood
2022-03-05 03:35:58	bx	im adding it to my project list
2022-03-05 03:35:58	malvarma	let me suggest another
2022-03-05 03:36:12	josh	that wouldn't be very hard
2022-03-05 03:36:21	josh	in fact you could just create a keyboard map
2022-03-05 03:36:40	bx	hehehhe
2022-03-05 03:36:53	bx	I might even be able to do it using tmux commands...
2022-03-05 03:37:11	natalia	i have been spending some time trying to write a post about the iso-8601 date representation format, which is commonly known for stuff like 2022-03-04 but actually hilariously complex
2022-03-05 03:37:21	josh	if you used emacs you could just use M-x rot13-region
2022-03-05 03:37:23	natalia	someone made an iceberg meme about it and i wanted to try explaining it but it's kind of like. dry and boring
2022-03-05 03:37:40	natalia	unlike some of the icebergs this one is just not that interesting to consider individual elements of i think
2022-03-05 03:37:47	josh	that sounds kinda interesting tbh
2022-03-05 03:37:49	bx	^
2022-03-05 03:37:58	bx	i'd watch/read an explaination of that
2022-03-05 03:38:28	josh	i'd read the first few paragraphs and skim the rest most likely
2022-03-05 03:38:33	josh	but that wouldn't be your fault
2022-03-05 03:38:39	bx	i find it hillarious how we can have all this technology and yet people are still fucking up/debating things as simple as how we write what date it is
2022-03-05 03:38:51	bx	i woula
2022-03-05 03:39:00	bx	*i would most likely visit it in bursts
2022-03-05 03:39:10	malvarma	natalia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm2hAFAZayk
2022-03-05 03:39:10	josh	i think the thing is that writing the date isn't actually simple
2022-03-05 03:39:11	natalia	the iceberg, fyi https://i.redd.it/mumdxume3wf81.png
2022-03-05 03:39:15	extratone	still think DavodTime is the best.
2022-03-05 03:39:33	malvarma	i love how it almost sounds like a band that doesn't know how to play
2022-03-05 03:39:42	malvarma	but also like something very hard to play
2022-03-05 03:39:44	josh	everything has hidden complexities that you don't notice until you really start working with it
2022-03-05 03:39:57	bx	josh: truuue
2022-03-05 03:40:09	malvarma	YYYYMMDD right?
2022-03-05 03:40:09	bx	I think it speaks to people overcomplicating things though
2022-03-05 03:40:32	natalia	the iceberg is hard because there's a lot of things that aren't that interesting once their components, which would be explained in previous parts of the iceberg, are made clear
2022-03-05 03:40:49	bx	what if you explain it bottom up?
2022-03-05 03:40:49	josh	go backwards then lol
2022-03-05 03:40:53	bx	jinx
2022-03-05 03:41:01	bx	(semantic jinx)
2022-03-05 03:41:12	natalia	for example 1985Y4M/ isn't that different from ../1985-04-12, it just *looks* like that when you see it from a distance
2022-03-05 03:41:17	malvarma	this is the best iceberg ive ever seen
2022-03-05 03:41:35	bx	wtf
2022-03-05 03:41:41	natalia	malvarma: haha i love this one
2022-03-05 03:41:45	josh	good lord
2022-03-05 03:41:53	bx	...why are all these valid
2022-03-05 03:42:16	natalia	spoiler: some of them arent :)
2022-03-05 03:42:18	josh	ISO8601 supports regex
2022-03-05 03:42:22	malvarma	yeah his stuff was all over the place, because he collaborated with all kinds of musicians. but he always sounds determined to not play guitar on his guitar
2022-03-05 03:42:25	bx	this is cursed in a bad way
2022-03-05 03:42:31	natalia	and most of them are kind of silly extensions nobody uses
2022-03-05 03:42:46	bx	malvarma: what does not playing guitar on a guitar mean?
2022-03-05 03:42:56	malvarma	bx listen to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm2hAFAZayk
2022-03-05 03:43:17	natalia	in its widest form, iso 8601, the Singular Date Standard Everyone Raves About, features Three different ways to express a sequence of a year, a month, and a date
2022-03-05 03:44:02	bx	malvarma: this just seems like a special style
2022-03-05 03:44:08	bx	like slapping or harmonics
2022-03-05 03:45:14	malvarma	yeah very much. its even more detectable when hes on acoustic. he does a lot of comboes involving muted strings, harmonics, extended techniques, and very little stuff people would normally recognize as a guitar solo
2022-03-05 03:45:16	bx	somehow this sounds wierdly good
2022-03-05 03:45:32	bx	i tried popping on my uke gur other day
2022-03-05 03:45:37	bx	it kinda sounds ok?
2022-03-05 03:45:44	malvarma	you play uke?!
2022-03-05 03:45:49	bx	...well
2022-03-05 03:45:51	bx	i truy
2022-03-05 03:45:53	bx	*try
2022-03-05 03:46:00	malvarma	me too! i also try
2022-03-05 03:46:02	bx	also one string is broken
2022-03-05 03:46:08	bx	so i replaced it with a piece of string
2022-03-05 03:46:10	malvarma	ah that sucks
2022-03-05 03:46:14	josh	lol
2022-03-05 03:46:19	bx	its surprsingly ok
2022-03-05 03:46:22	malvarma	i bet that string sounds glorious
2022-03-05 03:46:27	josh	same tbh
2022-03-05 03:46:34	malvarma	nice josh !
2022-03-05 03:46:52	bx	town is secretyl filled with uke players
2022-03-05 03:46:56	josh	just replace all the strings with string
2022-03-05 03:47:00	bx	oh god
2022-03-05 03:47:06	josh	oh no that wasn't a "same i play uke"
2022-03-05 03:47:20	bx	o
2022-03-05 03:47:20	malvarma	oh! my bad
2022-03-05 03:47:32	bx	would you be open to starting to play gur uke ? <halfjoke>
2022-03-05 03:47:46	josh	although i play piano so i pretend i could play anything
2022-03-05 03:47:53	malvarma	replace all the strings on your uke with integers
2022-03-05 03:47:59	josh	i've played on ukes before, they are kinda weird
2022-03-05 03:48:04	bx	malvarma: HA
2022-03-05 03:48:05	josh	i don't like the order of the strings
2022-03-05 03:48:10	malvarma	reentrant tuning
2022-03-05 03:48:16	malvarma	ah but thats the beauty of it
2022-03-05 03:48:16	bx	you can reorder them if you want
2022-03-05 03:48:19	bx	also
2022-03-05 03:48:24	bx	i tried tuing mine by ear
2022-03-05 03:48:24	josh	replace them with complex numbers
2022-03-05 03:48:33	bx	i am 100% sure its not actually in tune
2022-03-05 03:48:34	malvarma	floating point uke
2022-03-05 03:48:49	bx	where my array uke at ?
2022-03-05 03:48:52	josh	or tensors?
2022-03-05 03:49:02	malvarma	just say its 100% in tune, in your own idiosyncratic microtonal system of tonal organization
2022-03-05 03:49:29	bx	ooooo
2022-03-05 03:49:29	josh	microtonal uke
2022-03-05 03:49:41	josh	it's "jazz"
2022-03-05 03:49:50	bx	id like to try swapping gur strings for electic guitar ones
2022-03-05 03:49:52	extratone	powerful.
2022-03-05 03:49:56	bx	and then use a magnetic pickup
2022-03-05 03:50:09	bx	also itd be fun to have paino hammers on it
2022-03-05 03:50:09	malvarma	ooh, i saw a electromagnetic uke
2022-03-05 03:50:12	josh	i'm sure electric ukes exist
2022-03-05 03:50:13	bx	O?
2022-03-05 03:50:14	extratone	I always wanted to put a bunch of pickups on a full upright piano soundboard.
2022-03-05 03:50:21	bx	dewit
2022-03-05 03:50:35	extratone	I'm sure it's been done but I don't know how to use gurgle.
2022-03-05 03:50:43	malvarma	i have an electric uke, but it's piezoelectric. made it myself from a crummier uke plus parts of broken things
2022-03-05 03:50:57	extratone	powerful 2
2022-03-05 03:51:03	bx	malvarma: niice
2022-03-05 03:51:10	bx	i have gur clip on piezos
2022-03-05 03:51:19	malvarma	those are good
2022-03-05 03:51:56	malvarma	extratone: whats gurgle?
2022-03-05 03:51:59	bx	i dont want to get any more music things before actually finishg a track though
2022-03-05 03:52:04	bx	google?
2022-03-05 03:52:06	extratone	google sorry.

2022-03-05 03:54:54	extratone	indeed I'm sorry I link that image so much I just find it... absolutely hilarious.
2022-03-05 03:55:00	extratone	because I am a child.

2022-03-05 03:55:15	bx	this is a good image
2022-03-05 03:55:26	malvarma	this should be the actual icon for chrome
2022-03-05 03:55:57	extratone	thank you!!! I've felt this way for a long time.
2022-03-05 03:56:25	extratone	I replace it whenever I remember. recently made a siri shortcut that builds the image back out of base64 just so I never lose it.

2022-03-05 03:58:00	josh	oh
2022-03-05 04:02:40	extratone	I hope I didn't ruin a good conversation again lol
2022-03-05 04:02:50	josh	of course not
2022-03-05 04:23:47	extratone	well personal automation is one of those topics ya know.
2022-03-05 04:35:11	extratone	wow just searching "tildeverse on iPhone" and my site is like the third result lol
2022-03-05 04:35:26	extratone	I guess it really is sortof an originalish idea.
2022-03-05 05:18:28	nincollin	tbh all devices should be able to be flashed/rooted/jailbroken/unlocked
2022-03-05 05:18:30	nincollin	it would reduce pointless e-waste
2022-03-05 05:32:03	extratone	agreed.
2022-03-05 05:32:23	extratone	maybe I'll see that become law in the US in my lifetime.
2022-03-05 05:32:32	extratone	probably not lol.
2022-03-05 06:39:18	extratone	I’ll bet if I brought up powershell that’d get a conversation going at this hour no?
2022-03-05 06:40:58	extratone	I was stumped for a good 5 minutes because I forgot Start-Service sshd.
2022-03-05 06:43:47	login	the error messages are not smart eonugh
2022-03-05 06:43:49	login	*enough
2022-03-05 06:44:13	extratone	to the degree that they don't really constitute error messages? lol
2022-03-05 06:44:51	extratone	the funniest thing is that there is a mac app for powershell distributed by Microsoft.
2022-03-05 07:04:16	login	so it works on macos natively?
2022-03-05 07:04:20	login	via that app?
2022-03-05 07:09:27	extratone	"natively" I'm not so sure. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.2

2022-03-05 15:21:08	extratone	uh oh did I break it.
2022-03-05 15:38:37	nihilazo	hi
2022-03-05 15:38:41	elly	hello :)
2022-03-05 15:39:05	nihilazo	how's town?
2022-03-05 15:39:30	elly	really excellent
2022-03-05 15:39:37	elly	slept well, just caught up on my RSS feeds and found a new one
2022-03-05 15:39:45	nihilazo	that's nice
2022-03-05 15:40:22	elly	yeah :)
2022-03-05 15:40:27	elly	sipping some coffee, considering my day
2022-03-05 15:41:15	extratone	that sounds healthy.
2022-03-05 15:41:41	extratone	I'm playing with puppy, who keeps knocking my iPhone suspension contraption on to me.
2022-03-05 15:42:16	extratone	the thing in these photos. https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/106935877849123993
2022-03-05 15:42:40	natalia	hello
2022-03-05 15:42:51	natalia	god, i should set up an rss reader, and also an rss feed on my own site
2022-03-05 15:43:02	nihilazo	hi
2022-03-05 15:43:34	natalia	anyway presently i am thinking about encryption
2022-03-05 15:43:43	extratone	uh oh.
2022-03-05 15:43:45	natalia	sqlite offers like, an on-disk encryption extension for its databases, right
2022-03-05 15:44:17	nihilazo	today I learned about polari and faild to buy any shiny leggings so that's both fun and a bit sad
2022-03-05 15:44:36	elly	https://i.imgur.com/Y7zltlc.png newsblur will actually autocomplete *any* feed URL that it knows of that more than a few people have
2022-03-05 15:44:44	elly	which is pretty darn cool for discovering new feeds
2022-03-05 15:44:56	natalia	and as a noncryptographer i am wondering about the security of disk encryption
2022-03-05 15:44:58	natalia	huh wild
2022-03-05 15:45:13	natalia	because database writes seem to be composed of like, small incremental changes
2022-03-05 15:45:41	elly	hm?
2022-03-05 15:46:43	natalia	like, if an attacker has access to all of the versions of your database you write to disk
2022-03-05 15:46:52	elly	you generally assume they don't
2022-03-05 15:46:55	natalia	and you make a lot of small changes that are written, like appending pieces of text to a table
2022-03-05 15:46:57	natalia	sure :P
2022-03-05 15:46:58	elly	if you are using disk crypto
2022-03-05 15:47:02	natalia	ah
2022-03-05 15:47:16	elly	disk crypto is intended to protect against someone getting access to your disk trying to retrieve data from it
2022-03-05 15:47:18	natalia	"disk encryption" was a misnomer on my part, thouhg,
2022-03-05 15:47:30	natalia	i meant to say uh, just the file is encrypted in this case sorry
2022-03-05 15:47:34	elly	ah
2022-03-05 15:47:51	elly	I don't know what threat that protects against exactly
2022-03-05 15:47:56	elly	just use full disk encryption
2022-03-05 15:48:07	natalia	fair enough
2022-03-05 15:48:54	natalia	i have a mobile device on which it'd be sufficiently difficult to get full disk encryption, but for some of my personal wiki stuff i encrypt that
2022-03-05 15:49:11	elly	(if you don't, even if your db contents are encrypted, unencrypted versions of it may get written to disk as part of your swap file or other temporary files)
2022-03-05 15:49:44	natalia	huh yeah
2022-03-05 15:49:57	natalia	tbh it does befuddle me who the encryption is *for*
2022-03-05 15:50:07	natalia	it's a proprietary extension (which means i guess i can't figure out any of the neat details anyway)
2022-03-05 15:50:21	elly	hmm
2022-03-05 15:50:21	natalia	it's very sqlite of them to only sell the extension that doesn't actually do anything useful to people who know what they're doing?
2022-03-05 15:50:23	natalia	:P
2022-03-05 15:50:32	elly	if I was going to guess, I would say that it exists for some kind of compliance reason
2022-03-05 15:51:56	natalia	hmm that makes sense
2022-03-05 15:54:02	natalia	idk like, i use file-based encryption on rare occasion because i have devices i like, *sort of* don't trust
2022-03-05 15:54:17	natalia	so like this sort of system is kind of a neat stop gap
2022-03-05 15:54:41	natalia	but that concern does not seem to be a big one for the kind of people who can fork over a thousand dollars for a license to the code for sure
2022-03-05 15:55:01	extratone	this just happened but I’ll bet it ain’t gonna last lol. https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/paulfollow.jpg
2022-03-05 16:01:47	elly	ooh, celeb juice
2022-03-05 16:04:23	extratone	having read Paul's editor's letters recently, I really think he could benefit from coming back here.

2022-03-05 17:27:16	login	is the joke that it is an emoji?
2022-03-05 17:27:33	nihilazo	I'm uncomfortable that a toot I made is getting so much attention
2022-03-05 17:27:36	nihilazo	it's scary
2022-03-05 17:27:52	nihilazo	especially because said toot is a random TIL post
2022-03-05 17:29:09	login	maybe it got promoted

2022-03-05 18:26:19	elly	are you excited?
2022-03-05 18:32:43	twee	i mean it's fun to work

2022-03-05 18:47:04	twee	elly: waiting
2022-03-05 18:51:14	elly	ah :)
2022-03-05 18:51:16	elly	good luck!
2022-03-05 18:54:18	nihilazo	I don't think I could ever do a job like that
2022-03-05 18:54:21	nihilazo	customer facing type stuff
2022-03-05 18:54:29	elly	how come?
2022-03-05 18:54:45	nihilazo	anxiety, autism, being generally bad at social stuff
2022-03-05 18:55:19	dzwdz	i mean
2022-03-05 18:55:26	dzwdz	it's not like you have to hold a good conversation with them
2022-03-05 18:55:38	dzwdz	there's probably some script to follow
2022-03-05 18:57:21	nihilazo	yeah but I'm the one they're gonna shout at if anything goes wrong
2022-03-05 18:57:21	natalia	a customer service job is not the worst possible way to improve your social skills
2022-03-05 18:57:35	nihilazo	and I'm the one who has to look happy when I come to their table and be able to take their order without having a breakdown
2022-03-05 18:57:40	dzwdz	natalia: true, actually
2022-03-05 18:57:51	natalia	coming from my own experience, it's not like, easy or anything
2022-03-05 18:58:25	nihilazo	ugh why does downloading podcasts have to not work in liferea. Why is there no good feed reader
2022-03-05 18:58:34	nihilazo	quiterss would be good if it didn't crash
2022-03-05 18:58:43	elly	newsblur :D
2022-03-05 18:58:45	nihilazo	or minimise to the taskbar and refuse to reappear
2022-03-05 18:58:48	nihilazo	newsblur?
2022-03-05 18:58:53	elly	the rss reader I use
2022-03-05 18:58:55	elly	I really like it
2022-03-05 18:59:18	nihilazo	oh it's a web service
2022-03-05 18:59:25	elly	yeah it is
2022-03-05 19:00:42	dzwdz	i want to create a communal rss2imap thing
2022-03-05 19:00:58	dzwdz	where you could connect your mail client to dzwdz@some.domain and have all your feeds forwarded there
2022-03-05 19:01:12	agafnd	that'd be a lot of emails.........
2022-03-05 19:01:32	dzwdz	that's on you for having lots of feeds
2022-03-05 19:01:42	dzwdz	email clients are perfect feed readers, prove me wrong
2022-03-05 19:02:02	dzwdz	no lockin to a single client, synchronization between devices without requiring webshit
2022-03-05 19:02:35	natalia	i mean "no lockin to a single client" is already what rss does yeah
2022-03-05 19:02:38	nihilazo	I want to try the tildeverse ttrss
2022-03-05 19:02:44	nihilazo	but idk how to get an account there
2022-03-05 19:02:46	dzwdz	natalia: no?
2022-03-05 19:02:50	dzwdz	if you move to a new client
2022-03-05 19:02:51	nihilazo	I used tinytinyrss a very long time ago
2022-03-05 19:02:54	nihilazo	and I'm not sure how it is now
2022-03-05 19:02:55	dzwdz	you lose all the data about unread feeds
2022-03-05 19:03:00	dzwdz	for example
2022-03-05 19:03:06	natalia	i suppose so yeah
2022-03-05 19:03:15	dzwdz	y'all know what
2022-03-05 19:03:25	dzwdz	i think i could figure this out with docker
2022-03-05 19:03:28	natalia	i do think email would be pretty good, honestly even a static web page would work for me
2022-03-05 19:03:49	elly	yeah, I used to have a static webpage generated by a cron job essentially
2022-03-05 19:03:53	elly	it did indeed work pretty well
2022-03-05 19:04:06	dzwdz	that's the healthiest way to do it tbh
2022-03-05 19:04:10	dzwdz	no unread entries piling up
2022-03-05 19:04:24	twee	dzwdz: i agree, i read my feeds via email, i'd dogfood a service if you made one
2022-03-05 19:04:33	twee	for convenience i currently use blogtrottr and it's ok
2022-03-05 19:04:46	elly	it worked fairly well but I ended up switching to newsblur because I wanted the unread tracking
2022-03-05 19:05:03	elly	and because the single feed model gave me trouble when I had sites that posted often and sites that posted rarely
2022-03-05 19:05:07	twee	i used to use a static web page, hacker news style headlines and i forwarded hn and lobste.rs there
2022-03-05 19:05:14	natalia	i want to patch an rss feed onto my own website but my main problem is.. i intentionally don't structure my website chronologically, and i don't know if i want to sacrifice that :P
2022-03-05 19:05:29	natalia	i did finally add a changelog, so an rss feed wouldn't be a terrible next step
2022-03-05 19:05:34	twee	i had a visited link style to strikethrough what i'd read
2022-03-05 19:05:45	dzwdz	twee: oooo, that's a super good idea
2022-03-05 19:06:04	dzwdz	but i don't have history synchronised across my browsers, sadly
2022-03-05 19:06:09	dzwdz	so that'd be annoying
2022-03-05 19:11:27	twee	me neither, i just only use one browser lol
2022-03-05 19:13:48	agafnd	symlinking the history directory for different firefox profiles
2022-03-05 19:13:57	agafnd	i'm sure that would cause no problems
2022-03-05 19:14:35	dzwdz	s/browsers/devices
2022-03-05 19:15:39	agafnd	symlinking the profile directory to a remote directory mounted with sshfs
2022-03-05 19:16:00	dzwdz	mobile devices?
2022-03-05 19:16:21	agafnd	right lol
2022-03-05 19:16:39	agafnd	also it would fail if you went offline like. ever
2022-03-05 19:16:59	agafnd	Which I guess would make it difficult to use a web browser anyway
2022-03-05 19:18:24	elly	ya, syncing with intermittent connectivity is very hard
2022-03-05 19:18:34	elly	you usually need a kind of journal approach
2022-03-05 19:18:43	dzwdz	it doesn't need to be the same file though
2022-03-05 19:19:00	dzwdz	have separate files for every browser instance
2022-03-05 19:20:13	elly	ya, but then you don't really have a synchronized history, you have a bunch of separate histories
2022-03-05 19:20:20	dzwdz	what's the difference?
2022-03-05 19:22:33	dzwdz	there isn't much difference between reading data from a single file and reading it from multiple files
2022-03-05 19:22:43	dzwdz	it's invisible to the user
2022-03-05 19:23:44	elly	hmm
2022-03-05 19:23:56	elly	usually synchronized history includes like, syncing when you delete entries as well
2022-03-05 19:24:31	dzwdz	my primary usecase for syncing history doesn't involve that; i never clean my history
2022-03-05 19:24:37	elly	ahh
2022-03-05 19:24:37	dzwdz	as in, never delete individual entries
2022-03-05 19:25:00	dzwdz	most of the features with minimal effort
2022-03-05 19:25:10	elly	go for it
2022-03-05 19:25:40	dzwdz	are browsers hackable for mere mortals?
2022-03-05 19:25:55	dzwdz	like i'd assume that'd be a pretty deep change
2022-03-05 19:30:44	twee	yeah i was basically imagining like "cat history/* | sort"
2022-03-05 19:30:59	dzwdz	yeah
2022-03-05 19:31:08	twee	which could work with something like surf?  probably?
2022-03-05 19:31:14	twee	or another nerd browser
2022-03-05 19:33:12	dzwdz	hm, seems like it'd be relatively simple to add to qutebrowser
2022-03-05 19:33:17	elly	most browsers store history in a sqlite database
2022-03-05 19:33:55	dzwdz	i don't think the storage format matters
2022-03-05 19:34:33	dzwdz	the interface via which the browser accesses it internally does
2022-03-05 19:35:16	dzwdz	if it's all nicely abstracted away into some functions from retrieving data from history and adding links, you could probably swap the implementation out for my idea
2022-03-05 19:36:04	elly	in Chromium it is done by this: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/history/core/browser/history_service.h?q=HistoryService&ss=chromium
2022-03-05 19:36:34	dzwdz	hm, speaking of google code
2022-03-05 19:36:59	dzwdz	do you think that if someone made an issue on [whatever issue tracker y'all use] about android's pathetic maximum password length limit someone'd bump that up?
2022-03-05 19:37:15	elly	possible? I don't know how Android tracks bugs
2022-03-05 19:37:15	dzwdz	like i think it'd be literally a single line change
2022-03-05 19:37:40	dzwdz	i have no idea why it's still there
2022-03-05 19:39:24	dzwdz	https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/180626957
2022-03-05 19:40:32	dzwdz	i love how i can't log into the issue tracker because i'm on qutebrowser
2022-03-05 19:40:36	elly	those kinds of bugs are super common unfortunately
2022-03-05 19:40:37	dzwdz	i'm not worthy of reporting bugs
2022-03-05 19:42:22	elly	ah well
2022-03-05 19:44:40	dzwdz	the "how the fuck are you in my email account" kind, or the "some googler made a stupid decision a few years back which weakens the security for seemingly no reason and could be fixed in around a minute but nobody has done it in over a decade" kind
2022-03-05 19:47:54	dzwdz	this annoys me way more than it should
2022-03-05 19:56:36	dzwdz	even if i did create an issue it wouldn't ever reach my phone
2022-03-05 19:56:43	dzwdz	s/it/the update
2022-03-05 19:56:44	sedbot	<dzwdz> even if i did create an issue the update wouldn't ever reach my phone
2022-03-05 19:56:51	dzwdz	assuming someone would finally bother to change that single line of code
2022-03-05 19:57:07	dzwdz	and i know google doesn't have time for such major changes
2022-03-05 19:57:22	elly	the "how are you in the email account" type of bug
2022-03-05 19:57:28	dzwdz	ah then
2022-03-05 20:00:23	twee	yooo thunderbird has a popup if you type attached in an email body but haven't attached anything
2022-03-05 20:00:31	twee	honestly talk about spark joy little features
2022-03-05 20:00:38	twee	that's made me really quite happy
2022-03-05 20:00:41	elly	nice :)
2022-03-05 20:00:46	elly	gmail does that too, it has saved me a time or two
2022-03-05 20:01:12	twee	cool feature
2022-03-05 20:06:11	the_default	harvesting a plant in botany just feels so ... sad. i don't know, can't really find a better word there. you've spent so much time caring for it, and you go and sacrifice it to have something new and different
2022-03-05 20:06:35	dzwdz	it'd be fun to have a botany-like which is more like a tamagotchi
2022-03-05 20:06:42	dzwdz	with people's gotchis getting into relationships n shit
2022-03-05 20:06:48	the_default	you don't need to harvest it, you don't gain anything from it, you're just sick and tired of staring at the same thing
2022-03-05 20:06:56	dzwdz	when you get another one it could send you postcards n shit
2022-03-05 20:06:57	the_default	dzwdz: how do you harvest a tamagotchi?
2022-03-05 20:07:09	dzwdz	you don't
2022-03-05 20:07:11	dzwdz	it moves out
2022-03-05 20:07:26	the_default	lame (/s)
2022-03-05 20:08:06	dzwdz	oh i haven't mentioned this in any public channels yet
2022-03-05 20:08:11	dzwdz	i've painted my nails black today
2022-03-05 20:08:13	extratone	you have to eat the device itself.
2022-03-05 20:08:14	the_default	cool!
2022-03-05 20:08:16	extratone	nice!
2022-03-05 20:08:25	dzwdz	at first it was weird because i didn't take into account how pale my skin is
2022-03-05 20:08:32	dzwdz	but now that i'm used to it i really like it
2022-03-05 20:09:14	dzwdz	i also put on the dumbest piece of clothing i have - a black dotted turtleneck - and it actually fits so well
2022-03-05 20:09:17	dzwdz	i look so fucking gay lol
2022-03-05 20:11:57	the_default	i love turtlenecks! but usually just plain colors
2022-03-05 20:12:08	dzwdz	i don't have any outside of this one
2022-03-05 20:12:45	dzwdz	i'd love some, though

2022-03-05 20:14:47	the_default	formal enough for school
2022-03-05 20:15:15	the_default	i just wear hoodie + sweatpants at home though
2022-03-05 20:18:53	dzwdz	btw, would anyone happen to have a place where i could host the rss2imap thing?
2022-03-05 20:19:19	the_default	yes, but not well
2022-03-05 20:19:31	the_default	actually no
2022-03-05 20:19:33	the_default	yes
2022-03-05 20:19:36	the_default	maybe
2022-03-05 20:23:59	extratone	you can host it on my neocities if you'd like.
2022-03-05 20:24:18	twee	it'd need to be dynamic right?
2022-03-05 20:24:32	dzwdz	yeah i need a proper server
2022-03-05 20:24:46	dzwdz	w/ docker
2022-03-05 20:24:53	extratone	oh... 
2022-03-05 20:25:03	dzwdz	this is going to be a mail server soo
2022-03-05 20:25:33	the_default	oh so no residential ips. i guess that's why you're asking instead of doing it yourself (i guess).
2022-03-05 20:25:57	dzwdz	it's just that i don't want to expose anything on my pi
2022-03-05 20:26:00	dzwdz	security etc
2022-03-05 20:26:12	dzwdz	i'd run a vm if it was more powerful
2022-03-05 20:26:14	dzwdz	but it isn't
2022-03-05 20:26:35	the_default	i really really just need to cough up the $20 to get my sever working
2022-03-05 20:26:43	dzwdz	what do you need, again?
2022-03-05 20:26:47	the_default	a cable
2022-03-05 20:26:51	dzwdz	what kind?
2022-03-05 20:27:12	the_default	some weird proprietary dell cable to connect the internal sas connector to the front panel
2022-03-05 20:27:41	dzwdz	hm

2022-03-05 20:28:00	the_default	i just can't get myself to waste more money on this thing. so instead of selling it, or actually getting it to do anything, i let it collect dust
2022-03-05 20:28:06	the_default	makes tons of sense (/s)
2022-03-05 20:28:22	the_default	piusbird: ok, will do!
2022-03-05 20:28:38	the_default	what're you streaming?
2022-03-05 20:29:18	piusbird	I think more of the game unless there's some coding you want to see
2022-03-05 20:29:53	piusbird	or some sysadminin stuff
2022-03-05 20:30:52	twee	has missmoss been on at all lately?
2022-03-05 20:31:00	dzwdz	i don't think so

2022-03-05 20:31:23	dzwdz	i think she's just very busy with work
2022-03-05 20:31:32	dzwdz	her neocities hasn't been updated at all either
2022-03-05 20:31:36	dzwdz	or at least it seems like it
2022-03-05 20:31:48	twee	often is the way: join as a teen, have fun, have to leave, come back later

2022-03-05 20:45:06	nihilazo	and he has reached peak flow
2022-03-05 20:45:08	juspib	dzwdz what's that thingy you want to host
2022-03-05 20:45:28	dzwdz	basically
2022-03-05 20:45:29	nihilazo	like, he has his setup so perfectly tuned that he can make a whole track super quickly
2022-03-05 20:45:46	dzwdz	you could point your mail client at dzwdz@thingy

2022-03-05 20:48:26	natalia	hi malvarma
2022-03-05 20:48:33	malvarma	natalia:  o/
2022-03-05 20:49:14	malvarma	how are you?
2022-03-05 20:54:04	natalia	brain is a bit sludge rn unfortunately
2022-03-05 20:54:07	natalia	thinking about networking code
2022-03-05 20:54:16	natalia	past 3 hours have whirred by
2022-03-05 20:54:34	malvarma	oh dear
2022-03-05 20:55:10	malvarma	i always struggle to come up with what to do when one's brain is like that
2022-03-05 20:55:19	natalia	how are you?
2022-03-05 20:55:58	malvarma	when i feel like that, sometimes i just wish someone would chloroform me
2022-03-05 20:56:37	natalia	haha yeah
2022-03-05 20:56:38	malvarma	i am ok. was preparing to apply for a different job. the cover letter part is always hard
2022-03-05 20:56:48	natalia	what field iydm?
2022-03-05 20:56:58	malvarma	because the job ads are written so poorly its hard to know what they are looking for
2022-03-05 20:57:37	malvarma	field... well im very general. supposed to be marketing, but i end up doing unrelated web stuff
2022-03-05 20:57:46	malvarma	so this job is for a job that combines that
2022-03-05 20:59:03	malvarma	they want me to know sharepoint. they added that in a little sentance at the bottom of the description. like, is that really a thing?
2022-03-05 20:59:17	elly	knowing sharepoint?
2022-03-05 20:59:25	malvarma	im sure plenty of businesses use sharepoint for their intranet. but there are really people who are like "yes im a sharepoint expert"
2022-03-05 20:59:36	malvarma	and businesses are like "good we need a sharepointmonger"
2022-03-05 20:59:45	elly	I'm sure there are
2022-03-05 20:59:55	elly	I have heard people assert expertise with just about anything you can imagine
2022-03-05 21:00:02	malvarma	hmm, to give context, though
2022-03-05 21:00:09	dzwdz	elly: what was the funniest one
2022-03-05 21:00:11	elly	I interviewed a candidate a few weeks ago who had "APIs" listed as a skill on their resume
2022-03-05 21:00:17	elly	not any specific one, just APIs in general
2022-03-05 21:00:25	malvarma	this ad also wants someone who knows html, css, javscript, various CMSes, have a marketing background, have social media experience, have design experience
2022-03-05 21:00:26	natalia	LMAO
2022-03-05 21:00:28	malvarma	and managerial skills
2022-03-05 21:00:38	elly	malvarma: sounds like a real generalist role, heh
2022-03-05 21:00:47	dzwdz	elly: bruh
2022-03-05 21:00:47	elly	I would guess they aren't gonna get all of them and are hoping for most
2022-03-05 21:00:51	dzwdz	how did they get the interview
2022-03-05 21:00:52	malvarma	well im saying, they better hire me. im the only person they are gonna get with all that crap
2022-03-05 21:00:56	natalia	i am an expert in decimal numbering
2022-03-05 21:01:18	elly	dzwdz: the recruiters don't generally disqualify you for having one dumb thing on your resume
2022-03-05 21:01:33	elly	malvarma: sounds like an easy cover letter to write :P
2022-03-05 21:01:35	malvarma	thats great natalia ! our business absolutely depends on place value notation
2022-03-05 21:01:40	natalia	i mean, at least with that you could be like yeah i can test for divisibility by 9
2022-03-05 21:01:57	elly	"dear prospective employer, I am one of probably 10 people on earth who has all of the skills you listed! it is your lucky day"
2022-03-05 21:02:15	elly	and go from there
2022-03-05 21:02:24	malvarma	i wish i could actually write something like that. a recruiting firm has the listing
2022-03-05 21:02:27	elly	oh
2022-03-05 21:02:36	malvarma	so some jerkwad recruiting cog has to read it first
2022-03-05 21:02:41	elly	yeah, gotcha
2022-03-05 21:03:32	elly	anyway, I've interviewed people who self-described as experts with just about anything... I interviewed a person not that long ago who had NetBIOS on their resume!
2022-03-05 21:03:50	elly	recruiters are often keyword-grepping to find candidates so people sometimes just go all in with the keywords
2022-03-05 21:03:53	malvarma	"dear fellow professional person, i am a professional person with multitudinous experience in proficiencies! below are some keywords for your scanner: synergy, powerpoint, html5"
2022-03-05 21:04:08	elly	unironically
2022-03-05 21:04:17	natalia	i am curious if anyone here has insights into those awful scanner things
2022-03-05 21:04:22	malvarma	well they also want someome with seo experience
2022-03-05 21:04:27	natalia	a while back i had a really funny idea that i don't think would make it past them
2022-03-05 21:04:37	elly	malvarma: "if you were good at your job we'd have heard of you"
2022-03-05 21:04:52	twee	nihilazo: that looks pretty cool
2022-03-05 21:04:55	malvarma	well, unless im using seo for reputation management
2022-03-05 21:05:16	elly	https://elly.town/d/resume.html this is how I do it - you can have a bunch of keywords and still not make it seem like you just dumped them all in without context
2022-03-05 21:05:55	malvarma	oh i got my resume down. thank you. i like your approach, and i take a similar one
2022-03-05 21:06:03	elly	yay :)
2022-03-05 21:06:10	dzwdz	damn your first job seems fun
2022-03-05 21:06:18	elly	Green Hills?
2022-03-05 21:06:21	dzwdz	yea
2022-03-05 21:06:28	elly	it was fun, that's the one where it was a defense contractor
2022-03-05 21:06:44	dzwdz	ah
2022-03-05 21:06:47	elly	they originally wanted to hire me to work on the RTOS itself, but they couldn't have a non-American work on it for contract reasons
2022-03-05 21:06:51	dzwdz	also, what was that kernel you've worked on?
2022-03-05 21:06:53	elly	so I got reassigned to work on the compiler and debug tools
2022-03-05 21:06:54	dzwdz	i don't think you've mentioned that yet
2022-03-05 21:07:08	malvarma	glad to see an internship that actually involves learning things
2022-03-05 21:07:22	elly	the one mentioned at CMU? it's actually closed source and private, funnily enough - it's the reference implementation for the OS class' projects
2022-03-05 21:07:31	elly	so it is not published anywhere
2022-03-05 21:07:45	dzwdz	i was more asking what was novel about it
2022-03-05 21:07:48	elly	oh
2022-03-05 21:08:12	elly	it's complicated to explain, but because it is a teaching system it supports a LOT of different behavior modes
2022-03-05 21:08:34	elly	like, for example, if you ask the kernel to schedule another thread, does that happen right away, after a short delay, etc
2022-03-05 21:08:43	dzwdz	WAIT that was an uni
2022-03-05 21:08:47	elly	or if you request data off the disk how long does it take to come back, do you always get a full buffer back, &c
2022-03-05 21:08:51	elly	yeah, CMU is a university
2022-03-05 21:08:51	dzwdz	holy shit i'm jealous of your two first jobs
2022-03-05 21:08:56	dzwdz	how the fuck did you land them
2022-03-05 21:09:10	elly	I was at university basically
2022-03-05 21:09:21	elly	that summer internship, I was hired out of university for
2022-03-05 21:09:31	elly	and then the research programmer job, I had been a teaching assistant for the OS class
2022-03-05 21:09:51	dzwdz	but how did you get into both of those situations
2022-03-05 21:10:38	elly	CMU is a somewhat famous university so there were a bunch of companies recruiting there, and I am pretty good at what I do
2022-03-05 21:10:42	elly	is I guess the most direct answer
2022-03-05 21:10:55	dzwdz	but like
2022-03-05 21:11:21	dzwdz	i don't think hiring people have magical glasses which show the information about what people are good at next to their bodies
2022-03-05 21:11:44	elly	are you asking about the interviews?
2022-03-05 21:11:45	dzwdz	you don't get a job by just being good
2022-03-05 21:11:52	elly	I did get interviewed for that internship, for sure
2022-03-05 21:11:59	dzwdz	no but how did that interview happen
2022-03-05 21:12:00	natalia	(btw: awful resume idea is: i used to make a lot of LaTeX based concrete poetry type art, such as https://equa.space/shadows/preview.png -- i have always wanted ot make a resume template that lets me decorate one of the margins or something with a cool art piece that is secretly a ton of keywords)
2022-03-05 21:12:05	elly	I applied
2022-03-05 21:12:08	dzwdz	ah
2022-03-05 21:12:10	dzwdz	well then
2022-03-05 21:12:14	dzwdz	lol
2022-03-05 21:12:21	malvarma	natalia: ahahahah!@!!!!!!
2022-03-05 21:12:23	elly	I was like, I am a sophomore CS student at this university, I am interested in operating systems and compiler design
2022-03-05 21:12:28	natalia	(judging from what i heard i don't think this would work, but i've always wanted to try it just because.)
2022-03-05 21:12:33	elly	and they were like, alright, come talk to us a bit more
2022-03-05 21:12:39	dzwdz	i interpreted "i was hired out" as them seeking you out
2022-03-05 21:12:45	elly	oh, not as a sophomore no
2022-03-05 21:13:09	elly	one of my jobs offers at the end of university was a company that came to me but mostly I was starting those conversations
2022-03-05 21:13:29	natalia	i appreciate the ascii art look actually being styled accessible text by the way
2022-03-05 21:13:39	natalia	s/ascii art/drawing box
2022-03-05 21:13:39	sedbot	<natalia> i appreciate the drawing box look actually being styled accessible text by the way
2022-03-05 21:13:52	elly	the boxes are css borders on divs
2022-03-05 21:13:58	dzwdz	i didn't even associate that with ascii art
2022-03-05 21:14:00	elly	they should be screenreader-invisible
2022-03-05 21:14:00	bx	afternoon town
2022-03-05 21:14:04	elly	hello!
2022-03-05 21:14:09	dzwdz	sup

2022-03-05 21:14:24	the_default	evening bx
2022-03-05 21:14:40	elly	(the HTML source of my resume has a bunch of comments and extra details about a lot of these jobs, also)
2022-03-05 21:14:41	natalia	maybe it's just me then but i have a strong association with short-width, box-drawing based, hand-written old text documents
2022-03-05 21:14:52	elly	ah, yeah :)
2022-03-05 21:14:57	elly	I could have used box drawing characters to do it
2022-03-05 21:15:03	elly	if it was plain text I might've
2022-03-05 21:15:14	malvarma	i remember borders. they were nice, back in the day
2022-03-05 21:15:30	malvarma	and bevels, and the ocasional drop shadow
2022-03-05 21:15:34	elly	heck yeah
2022-03-05 21:15:38	elly	I still do love this box style
2022-03-05 21:15:38	bx	dzwdz: not much is up, mostly pondering how to continue this bit of music and cursed C/Js :D
2022-03-05 21:15:41	bx	you?
2022-03-05 21:15:50	dzwdz	finally working on that rss2imap thing
2022-03-05 21:15:51	elly	my slide decks are all rounded borders and monospace fonts, stylistically
2022-03-05 21:15:59	dzwdz	but now that i think about it i should end the break from the draft and get back to it
2022-03-05 21:16:03	elly	I am very pleased with the visual design language I settled on
2022-03-05 21:16:33	bx	dzwdz: Oh nice, i remmeber you mentiotning that before
2022-03-05 21:16:52	 *	anton is currently watching https://www.twitch.tv/piusbird
2022-03-05 21:17:01	malvarma	me too
2022-03-05 21:17:06	malvarma	good show
2022-03-05 21:18:20	natalia	huh, so i've been using ed(1) for a project, and i followed the advice of someone a bit ago to use rlwrap
2022-03-05 21:18:27	natalia	and.. well, that makes inserting tabs break, lol
2022-03-05 21:18:32	natalia	wonder if that's fixable
2022-03-05 21:20:17	elly	rlwrap around ed? oh my
2022-03-05 21:20:25	elly	that sounds chaotic
2022-03-05 21:20:41	bx	that sounds like a good feature for a newer ed
2022-03-05 21:20:45	natalia	i wanted to try it just for fun mostly, i missed my ^A and ^E when inserting
2022-03-05 21:20:52	natalia	but it isn't worth it, too intrusive
2022-03-05 21:21:17	natalia	my main ed+adhd problem is having to switch Contexts too often when noticing a simple typo, and i was hoping it'd help with that
2022-03-05 21:21:24	elly	if you make a mistake that cannot be fixed with backspace in ed, just hit enter and fix the line post hoc
2022-03-05 21:21:30	elly	imo
2022-03-05 21:21:56	dzwdz	but left/right arrows
2022-03-05 21:22:14	natalia	i mean i do agree in theory, and to be fair i am asking for cognitive load when using ed lol
2022-03-05 21:22:47	natalia	ed is kind of nice though because i can more easily view what i *just* entered, and read that to review it
2022-03-05 21:23:10	malvarma	im just imagining you're talking about a person named edward
2022-03-05 21:23:15	natalia	true...
2022-03-05 21:23:18	malvarma	and i agree, ed's kind of nice
2022-03-05 21:24:51	extratone	I still need to learn how to do more than just open ed and quit it.
2022-03-05 21:25:48	natalia	edward doesn't understand when you speak nonsense at him and just sort of gives you a puzzling look
2022-03-05 21:26:11	extratone	lmao.
2022-03-05 21:26:47	malvarma	thats what programming is. there are little people inside your computer. like reboot. you just gotta tell them what to do
2022-03-05 21:26:55	<--	palmdrop (palmdrop@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
2022-03-05 21:27:02	extratone	I will only question about ed: is there a way to save changes to the file you've opened and what is it.
2022-03-05 21:27:08	natalia	w
2022-03-05 21:27:10	extratone	ask*
2022-03-05 21:27:11	dzwdz	YOU are the little people in my computer though
2022-03-05 21:27:12	extratone	BLESS YOU

2022-03-05 21:27:55	twee	natalia: there's definitely a version of ed out there that uses readline
2022-03-05 21:28:48	extratone	I've actually downloaded like 5 manuals on ed but I guess I'm newish to reading man page format.

2022-03-05 21:30:23	twee	anyone have any good resources on typesetting with troff?
2022-03-05 21:30:42	extratone	ed is the singular editor natively installed on the CLI app I'm using so this is a big deal.
2022-03-05 21:31:44	natalia	that's hilarious, what app
2022-03-05 21:31:58	natalia	ed isn't even installed by default on debian anymore :(
2022-03-05 21:32:16	malvarma	waiting for the job ad that requires 10 yrs experience of ed
2022-03-05 21:32:43	bx	imagine walking into an interview
2022-03-05 21:32:52	twee	oh shit
2022-03-05 21:32:58	twee	im in my sixth year of emacs experience
2022-03-05 21:33:02	bx	and they ask you to demonstrate your ed profficiency
2022-03-05 21:33:02	twee	which is crazy
2022-03-05 21:33:21	bx	im on my 7th year of nano :D
2022-03-05 21:33:25	malvarma	please write some ed hotkeys on this whiteboard

2022-03-05 21:33:54	twee	good year to be on, the_default
2022-03-05 21:33:57	natalia	i mean technically you could use readline to make macros (sorry sorry)
2022-03-05 21:34:04	bx	oh my god
2022-03-05 21:34:07	extratone	natalia, Blink Shell https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306
2022-03-05 21:34:16	anton	I think I'm still on my 0th year of emacs
2022-03-05 21:34:19	the_default	twee: you meean you use nano for normal editing? or have used it for 7 years?
2022-03-05 21:34:42	natalia	(wish i knew that when i was using ed on a far poorer network connection when i joined here originally)
2022-03-05 21:34:49	natalia	extratone: what's the difference between that and iSH, if you've used that?
2022-03-05 21:35:11	malvarma	'proficient in ls. expert at pwd."
2022-03-05 21:35:16	elly	heck yeah
2022-03-05 21:35:35	the_default	wow, not even beginner in mv
2022-03-05 21:35:39	extratone	oh when it comes to iOS, I've used everything. do you mean functional difference or construction?
2022-03-05 21:35:51	natalia	functional
2022-03-05 21:35:54	malvarma	"mkdir ninja"
2022-03-05 21:36:10	twee	the_default: i've used nano since starting using linux, and have spent about two of those years using nano as my primary editor
2022-03-05 21:36:15	natalia	i know a little about iSH's construction because i'm friends with its main developer but don't know a lot about the interface concerns
2022-03-05 21:36:28	twee	see https://noa-s.neocities.org/nano.html
2022-03-05 21:36:42	twee	and the hacker news discussion criticising my lack of capitalisation :/

2022-03-05 21:37:04	twee	madness
2022-03-05 21:37:06	bx	twee: same story lol
2022-03-05 21:37:15	extratone	Blink is built almost exclusively to deal with remote files. they both get into the filesystem natively but ya know iSh is more like an Alpine emulator.
2022-03-05 21:37:19	extratone	a-Shell is a fork of Blink. https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438
2022-03-05 21:37:39	natalia	aha!
2022-03-05 21:37:53	extratone	I’m working on a thing about Blink and Town right now, natalia. https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink
2022-03-05 21:38:03	anton	twee: I find it easier to read things when there are capital letters personally
2022-03-05 21:38:12	natalia	ed but no ex or vi? :P
2022-03-05 21:38:15	anton	tbh, I don't entirely understand the trend of no caps
2022-03-05 21:38:48	extratone	anti-establishment lol
2022-03-05 21:38:51	natalia	mad respect for whatever design decision led to that though honestly
2022-03-05 21:38:55	natalia	i switch between caps and no caps a lot
2022-03-05 21:39:01	elly	no caps?
2022-03-05 21:39:08	the_default	no cap
2022-03-05 21:39:16	malvarma	ALL CAPS ALL THE TIME
2022-03-05 21:39:18	elly	oh, not capitalizing sentence starts?
2022-03-05 21:39:33	malvarma	i think it depends on what you're writing
2022-03-05 21:39:37	dzwdz	speaking of all caps, rip DOOM
2022-03-05 21:39:45	elly	hm?
2022-03-05 21:39:51	malvarma	caps are nice when reading long paragraphs
2022-03-05 21:39:52	natalia	elly: yeah, and or anything
2022-03-05 21:39:55	natalia	idk i'm very inconsistent about it
2022-03-05 21:40:02	malvarma	but unnecessary for single lines of text
2022-03-05 21:40:06	anton	yeah
2022-03-05 21:40:07	twee	i personally say words with capitals differently in my head and it throws off what i mean
2022-03-05 21:40:09	dzwdz	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSJeHDlhYls
2022-03-05 21:40:15	natalia	nowadays with actual writing i tend to capitalize things because it helps for readability for a lot of people i've talked to, but i don't like the tone it imparts on my text sometimes
2022-03-05 21:40:20	twee	i write my essays for uni with caps
2022-03-05 21:40:33	natalia	i like the aesthetic of lowercase headers, so i tend to do that anyways
2022-03-05 21:40:38	elly	valid
2022-03-05 21:40:49	twee	i always do headers lower case, and my name is always lower case
2022-03-05 21:40:58	twee	i tend to capitalise people's names
2022-03-05 21:41:07	bx	I like using what ever symbol looks better / is easier to write...
2022-03-05 21:41:12	the_default	hOW ABOUT THIS? rEVERSE CAPS. oH GOD I HATE IT
2022-03-05 21:41:20	twee	i don't capitalise emails, i do capitalise submitted work.  i don't capitalise things on my personal site
2022-03-05 21:41:44	dzwdz	my journal might just be the only nonofficial thing i write where i care about capitalisation
2022-03-05 21:41:49	twee	i do capitalise when talking to some of my friends who use me to learn better english, because i think it's unfair to them to become acclimatised to my native quirks
2022-03-05 21:42:03	bx	Oh that's a point
2022-03-05 21:42:16	natalia	not capitalizing sentences is ingrained in me partially via toki pona (which doesn't capitalize anything but its set of proper nouns)
2022-03-05 21:42:22	dzwdz	o, you have friends specifically to help them practice english?
2022-03-05 21:42:26	dzwdz	that's neat
2022-03-05 21:42:27	twee	i might write a style guide at some point, i don't believe in capitalising i
2022-03-05 21:42:34	twee	dzwdz: yeah
2022-03-05 21:42:53	dzwdz	how did that come about?
2022-03-05 21:43:03	twee	i mean generally it starts like that and then we're normal friends, or vice versa, but if they ask me to help with english i will use the Queen's English
2022-03-05 21:43:11	twee	various societies mostly
2022-03-05 21:43:24	extratone	paul ford finally replied to my tilde tweet at him hehe. https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1500224762257281030

2022-03-05 21:44:17	twee	extratone: cute :)
2022-03-05 21:44:22	dzwdz	aww
2022-03-05 21:44:38	twee	i really like danah boyd's page on it

2022-03-05 21:45:05	natalia	today on: Let's Ask Quora!
2022-03-05 21:45:08	extratone	oh my god... I did not know english dot stackexchange dot com existed until this moment and I'm scared.
2022-03-05 21:45:10	natalia	> “I” is capitalized because it refers to a specific person, in this case, it refers to you.
2022-03-05 21:45:57	twee	it's a decent one tbh
2022-03-05 21:46:24	dzwdz	i crashed thunderbird!
2022-03-05 21:46:51	elly	time to file a bug!
2022-03-05 21:47:20	dzwdz	i haven't updated in a while and the crash was random
2022-03-05 21:47:26	dzwdz	i'm not going to bother
2022-03-05 21:47:29	elly	rip
2022-03-05 21:47:31	bx	dzwdz: i pictured gur planes withg ur puppets crashing at firs

2022-03-05 21:52:16	dzwdz	sneak peek
2022-03-05 21:52:47	extratone	ooo
2022-03-05 21:53:18	dzwdz	and you can just connect to this over imap
2022-03-05 21:53:27	dzwdz	i'll create a web interface for subscribing for feeds n stuff
2022-03-05 21:54:15	bx	looking good
2022-03-05 21:54:58	malvarma	the_default: lOVE iT
2022-03-05 21:55:18	dzwdz	juspib: fyi, this is basically what i wanted the server for
2022-03-05 21:56:10	dzwdz	i wonder if there are people out there who'd use that as a paid service
2022-03-05 21:57:10	malvarma	thunderbird doesn't do RSS on it's own?
2022-03-05 21:57:36	dzwdz	the point is that this works over imap
2022-03-05 21:57:51	dzwdz	automatically syncs across devices
2022-03-05 21:57:56	dzwdz	you aren't locked into a single client
2022-03-05 21:57:58	malvarma	is that so you can sync clients and know whats read and isnt read?
2022-03-05 21:57:59	dzwdz	etc
2022-03-05 21:58:01	dzwdz	yeah
2022-03-05 21:58:03	dzwdz	pretty much
2022-03-05 21:58:06	malvarma	ah good deal
2022-03-05 21:58:31	malvarma	i usually just export a list of feeds and sync that, but true that doesn't keep track of what i've read
2022-03-05 21:58:43	malvarma	this is easier
2022-03-05 21:59:22	twee	anker have some very nice cable colours
2022-03-05 21:59:35	twee	but for some reason some of them are usb-c->lightning exclusive :/
2022-03-05 21:59:39	dzwdz	not that i'd bill y'all, but 5 people paying $1/mo for this would already pay for a cheap vps
2022-03-05 21:59:41	twee	why can i not have a pink cable
2022-03-05 22:01:30	malvarma	i dont think i'd pay for something like that, but perhaps someone would
2022-03-05 22:01:49	malvarma	sometimes i try to come up with business ideas, and i get stuck because i think "i would never buy something like that"
2022-03-05 22:02:02	twee	but then you have to think
2022-03-05 22:02:06	malvarma	because i would never buy anything. and thats why everything i own is old and falling a part
2022-03-05 22:02:08	twee	"maybe i would use that for free"
2022-03-05 22:02:15	twee	and then come up with a way to put user tracking in it
2022-03-05 22:02:21	dzwdz	^
2022-03-05 22:02:59	elly	I am currently paying $3/mo for newsblur
2022-03-05 22:03:00	malvarma	lol
2022-03-05 22:03:14	elly	I wonder how many other people are using subscription rss clients
2022-03-05 22:03:35	twee	i'm paying like five quid for simple hosting on gandi and that's about it subscription wise
2022-03-05 22:03:39	twee	i reckon a fair few?
2022-03-05 22:03:47	twee	miniflux is a sustainable business now i think
2022-03-05 22:04:00	malvarma	yeah a good number of people subscriped to stuff after google reader went away, i think
2022-03-05 22:05:05	twee	the kind of nerds who used rss in google reader era are the kind of nerds who are like ah yeah, i'm gonna pay to keep a good thing going now that i've been fucked
2022-03-05 22:05:15	twee	everyone else went google/apple news or feedly
2022-03-05 22:05:29	twee	yo what happened to flipboard
2022-03-05 22:05:32	twee	i think that's the name
2022-03-05 22:05:33	elly	a big part of why I pay for newsblur is so it will keep existing, definitely
2022-03-05 22:05:40	twee	good shout
2022-03-05 22:06:17	elly	same deal for sourcehut
2022-03-05 22:06:28	twee	according to newsblur's homepage they have had 4,481 (log in i think) in the past day
2022-03-05 22:06:29	extratone	on iOS, Inoreader is the popuular free option still. imo rss is not a nerd thing. or at least it was pretty democratized with google reader.
2022-03-05 22:06:33	malvarma	i am so worried about stuff not expisting if i dont pay for it. ive got patreon and libera pay funnelling dollars to various things
2022-03-05 22:06:45	malvarma	but then i think "but i cant pay for this alone. what if nobody else pays"
2022-03-05 22:07:04	dzwdz	open source funding is a joke
2022-03-05 22:07:11	bx	i mean if you cant alone then itll just shutdown and then you wont have too
2022-03-05 22:07:15	elly	malvarma: yeah, the only real answer to that is like, if it goes away you switch to something else
2022-03-05 22:07:38	malvarma	dzwdz: yes it sadly is
2022-03-05 22:07:41	elly	which is why it's important to pick a service where you can migrate easily I guess
2022-03-05 22:07:48	twee	yeah
2022-03-05 22:07:54	extratone	I've been using Windows for years. I basically prepare for every single application to go out of support at any time lol
2022-03-05 22:07:59	juspib	quote for today: Childhood is when you're a child, and adulthood is when you're an adult
2022-03-05 22:08:02	dzwdz	this is so often glossed over
2022-03-05 22:08:02	twee	i was so impressed with how fast i was able to move my email
2022-03-05 22:08:05	dzwdz	funding aside
2022-03-05 22:08:11	bx	!qotd
2022-03-05 22:08:11	anna	How far is a light-year? How far is a light-year?
2022-03-05 22:08:15	malvarma	and elly thats always the thing in the back of my mind
2022-03-05 22:08:32	dzwdz	projects should make migrating away from them as easy as possible
2022-03-05 22:08:34	twee	that's why i have a winrar license
2022-03-05 22:08:37	twee	i lie, i don't
2022-03-05 22:08:43	twee	i bought one as a birthday presetn for a friend
2022-03-05 22:09:04	extratone	a good present, I'd say.
2022-03-05 22:09:13	bx	a winrar licence feels almost like some kind of rare artificact
2022-03-05 22:09:28	bx	like finding a dinosaur fossil
2022-03-05 22:09:37	elly	newsblur both imports and exports OPML
2022-03-05 22:09:45	extratone	the amount of redundant developer effort/time/money going into basically identical apps on the iOS platform is actually sickening
2022-03-05 22:09:49	dzwdz	soaking of buying software, I've just remembered coming across some dude selling firefox on a darknet market
2022-03-05 22:09:59	dzwdz	speaking*
2022-03-05 22:10:00	extratone	but I don't want to burden you all with such thoughts, actually.
2022-03-05 22:10:10	malvarma	tired: buying nfts. wired: buying a winrar license
2022-03-05 22:10:17	extratone	lol
2022-03-05 22:10:45	bx	malvarma: plottwist it comes stored as a .rar
2022-03-05 22:10:46	dzwdz	yo wait a sec
2022-03-05 22:10:52	bx	like gur packaging on scisors
2022-03-05 22:11:09	dzwdz	i think you've just discovered a slightly sensible usecase for nfts
2022-03-05 22:11:13	malvarma	ahahahahaha
2022-03-05 22:11:14	extratone	dzwdz that thing where open source stuff get fraudulently sold? yeah, that is the entirety of microsoft's app marketplace rn.
2022-03-05 22:11:17	dzwdz	software licensing
2022-03-05 22:11:18	elly	https://i.imgur.com/HYRJIKc.png gosh
2022-03-05 22:11:29	malvarma	but we do software licensing now and its fine
2022-03-05 22:11:30	dzwdz	extratone: on a fucking darknet market though
2022-03-05 22:11:33	dzwdz	like, lel
2022-03-05 22:12:02	bx	elly: lmao
2022-03-05 22:12:13	bx	we need more dramatically labeled buttons
2022-03-05 22:12:15	elly	we do
2022-03-05 22:12:18	extratone	gimp for $4.99 though.
2022-03-05 22:12:30	 *	malvarma rapidly clicks 'erase yourself' waiting for something to happen
2022-03-05 22:12:36	extratone	lol
2022-03-05 22:12:48	bx	dzwdz: I mean i also used it to sent a bad lady gaga remix...
2022-03-05 22:12:53	elly	I like the use of email for snapshotting, it's clever
2022-03-05 22:13:04	elly	if you do destructive actions newsblur mails you copies of your OPML export
2022-03-05 22:13:09	dzwdz	bx: dude
2022-03-05 22:13:13	dzwdz	darknet markets != tor
2022-03-05 22:13:18	bx	ik ik
2022-03-05 22:13:19	dzwdz	i was talking about drug marketplaces
2022-03-05 22:13:20	bx	but like
2022-03-05 22:13:32	bx	wait
2022-03-05 22:13:38	dzwdz	the perfect place to get your browser from
2022-03-05 22:13:41	bx	why are they selling software on a drug market place
2022-03-05 22:13:47	bx	thats for drugs
2022-03-05 22:13:56	dzwdz	well it's a general marketplace
2022-03-05 22:14:02	dzwdz	you can also buy shitty fortnite aimbots
2022-03-05 22:14:08	dzwdz	firefox
2022-03-05 22:14:16	bx	I could sell a bad lady gag remix
2022-03-05 22:14:19	bx	*haha
2022-03-05 22:14:21	bx	*gaga
2022-03-05 22:14:26	juspib	tilde.town is a darnket marketplace
2022-03-05 22:15:00	dzwdz	danknet
2022-03-05 22:15:02	twee	elly: id be shocked if a premium rss reader didn't let you import and export opml
2022-03-05 22:15:04	extratone	I always suspected.
2022-03-05 22:15:05	malvarma	linux is my drug of choice
2022-03-05 22:15:10	malvarma	i need rehab
2022-03-05 22:15:13	extratone	isn't opml just xml
2022-03-05 22:15:21	elly	twee: me also
2022-03-05 22:15:28	malvarma	im addicted to making computers inconvenient
2022-03-05 22:15:32	elly	extratone: "just xml" is like saying "isn't [format] just bytes"
2022-03-05 22:15:34	bx	malvarma: lmao
2022-03-05 22:15:36	elly	you still have to interpret it
2022-03-05 22:15:43	juspib	linux is making computers convenient tho
2022-03-05 22:15:43	bx	what would be rehab? bsd?
2022-03-05 22:16:14	dzwdz	it'd be throwing your computer out the window
2022-03-05 22:16:16	malvarma	juspib: depending on your perspective
2022-03-05 22:16:18	extratone	malvarma, try macos. it's just linux you have to persuade instead of command.
2022-03-05 22:16:25	dzwdz	ACAB
2022-03-05 22:16:29	dzwdz	(all computers are bastards)
2022-03-05 22:16:35	bx	extratone: i wish that wasnt accurate
2022-03-05 22:16:37	elly	imo computer rehab would be rearranging your life so you use computers less
2022-03-05 22:16:37	bx	well
2022-03-05 22:16:39	malvarma	ALL CAPS ARE BEST
2022-03-05 22:16:42	bx	its more like bsd you persuade
2022-03-05 22:17:13	bx	elly: or so they hurt you less to use
2022-03-05 22:17:14	extratone	I have banned myself from using Linux because I can't stop myself from fiddling.
2022-03-05 22:17:25	elly	bx: yeah, maybe
2022-03-05 22:17:37	elly	if computers hurt you to use you should definitely fix that, if you want to use computers as a career :P
2022-03-05 22:17:48	extratone	(even though I've just endlessly fiddling with iOS apps instead, which is just more frustrating.)
2022-03-05 22:17:49	bx	ive had to stop using gur standing rig gur last few weeks and my back hurts from sitting
2022-03-05 22:18:06	 *	bx doesnt want to use them as a carreer
2022-03-05 22:18:15	dzwdz	i think i'm only using computers because of stockholm syndrome
2022-03-05 22:18:19	 *	bx is mildly concerned that could eventually be his only option
2022-03-05 22:18:29	juspib	compare "apt install program" to looking for an exe in your browser then clicking thru the gui installer
2022-03-05 22:18:32	malvarma	using computers for anything besides neat art projects and the ocasional spreadsheet was a mistake
2022-03-05 22:18:38	bx	^ that
2022-03-05 22:18:45	dzwdz	i disagree
2022-03-05 22:18:50	elly	aw
2022-03-05 22:18:54	elly	I really enjoy computering
2022-03-05 22:18:57	dzwdz	computers are invaluable
2022-03-05 22:18:58	elly	I'm sad to hear that folks don't
2022-03-05 22:19:02	bx	i like em
2022-03-05 22:19:17	bx	i dont like it when corporate bs kinda bogs them down though
2022-03-05 22:19:27	extratone	juspib there's winget now. baby windows is finally almost a real operating system. it has its own package manager!
2022-03-05 22:19:29	dzwdz	free access to information, safe communication with people around the globe, etc
2022-03-05 22:19:38	malvarma	i think many people are forced to use computers, and forced to use unhealthy and bad types of computer things
2022-03-05 22:19:46	bx	truuue
2022-03-05 22:19:54	dzwdz	i was getting destroyed in chess by some south african dude last week
2022-03-05 22:19:56	dzwdz	thanks to computers
2022-03-05 22:19:59	malvarma	but if they weren't, more people would realize computering is fun
2022-03-05 22:20:03	bx	As a tool for communication and human expession / math i think computers are wonderful things
2022-03-05 22:20:04	extratone	* linux belongs to the working class. *
2022-03-05 22:20:07	malvarma	dzwdz: thats a good use of computers
2022-03-05 22:21:16	natalia	it would be nice if linux belonged to the working class but i find that sort of unbelievable
2022-03-05 22:21:26	dzwdz	what would that even mean
2022-03-05 22:21:29	bx	^
2022-03-05 22:21:41	bx	does it belong to anyone
2022-03-05 22:21:48	dzwdz	as far as i'm concerned, linux is a very nice tool for anyone with resources to spy on me
2022-03-05 22:21:52	dzwdz	so much code to hide some shit in
2022-03-05 22:22:08	bx	you just remdined me of soemthing
2022-03-05 22:22:13	malvarma	linux belongs mostly to the shared interests of a lot of players, mostly corporations that depend on it? but i guess it also belongs to anyone who uses it, since you get the source code
2022-03-05 22:22:39	dzwdz	that's a weird definition of belonging
2022-03-05 22:22:46	natalia	sure but like, if all of the sudden a bunch of corporations don't want to fund it anymore, that belonging is mostly meaningless
2022-03-05 22:22:54	natalia	because oops security vulnerabilities
2022-03-05 22:23:09	malvarma	yeah there are multiple weird definitions of belonging that come into play
2022-03-05 22:23:17	dzwdz	very hot take
2022-03-05 22:23:22	dzwdz	software doesn't have to have bugs
2022-03-05 22:23:36	malvarma	like, does any software belong to me if i cant modify it?
2022-03-05 22:23:41	dzwdz	it's possible to write perfect software
2022-03-05 22:23:53	dzwdz	updates are overrated
2022-03-05 22:24:17	malvarma	at a certain scale, i dont think you can expect perfection, in practice
2022-03-05 22:24:21	extratone	I suppose I should've said *rightfully belongs* and I don't mean ownership in that sense.
2022-03-05 22:24:33	malvarma	but if you're planning to run an old os and not hook it up to a network, that should be fine
2022-03-05 22:24:35	bx	what do gur updates even do for most stuff, win update doesnt add shit i eve use
2022-03-05 22:24:50	dzwdz	see
2022-03-05 22:24:52	extratone	I guess I just believe Linux should be vastly more democratized
2022-03-05 22:25:01	dzwdz	microkernels are a thing
2022-03-05 22:25:05	juspib	software belongs to you if you are the author or it's free software
2022-03-05 22:25:13	malvarma	bx sometimes remove vulnerabilities that make you susceptible to malware
2022-03-05 22:25:27	dzwdz	you can have a perfectly implemented kernel
2022-03-05 22:25:43	dzwdz	see: seL4, which is mathematically proved to be correct
2022-03-05 22:25:49	bx	malvarma: ok those are fine, but it downloads waaaay more than that
2022-03-05 22:26:13	bx	dzwdz: i agree you can have a bug free kernel, but updates can still be needed to account for hw issues
2022-03-05 22:26:19	malvarma	then why aren't we using seL4 for everything? (not trying to be a jerk, honestly curious)
2022-03-05 22:26:19	bx	e.g. spectre and friends
2022-03-05 22:26:32	elly	malvarma: it doesn't support the hardware people have
2022-03-05 22:26:36	elly	or the apps people have
2022-03-05 22:26:39	bx	^
2022-03-05 22:26:41	bx	also
2022-03-05 22:26:43	dzwdz	and i don't think there are consumer oses for it
2022-03-05 22:26:44	bx	its barebones af
2022-03-05 22:26:48	dzwdz	well there's that one
2022-03-05 22:26:50	elly	those two factors are 100% of why nobody uses most OSes
2022-03-05 22:26:50	bx	there are some iiirc
2022-03-05 22:26:50	dzwdz	uh
2022-03-05 22:26:59	dzwdz	fuck, i forgot the name
2022-03-05 22:26:59	bx	i think its called geode
2022-03-05 22:27:01	dzwdz	but it's weird
2022-03-05 22:27:07	dzwdz	genode
2022-03-05 22:27:09	natalia	verified in what sense also? there is surely a plethora of weird cpu hardware bugs or new attack mechanisms whatever right?
2022-03-05 22:27:16	bx	dzwdz: thats gur one
2022-03-05 22:27:20	dzwdz	wdym new attack mechanisms
2022-03-05 22:27:32	dzwdz	here i'm talking about software only
2022-03-05 22:27:35	elly	like, the discovery of rowhammer or similar
2022-03-05 22:27:39	elly	hardware bugs that require software fixes
2022-03-05 22:27:46	bx	^
2022-03-05 22:27:49	elly	or spectre/meltdown
2022-03-05 22:28:14	natalia	even like "does it formally verify itself against timing attacks" seems to be an interesting question
2022-03-05 22:28:17	natalia	not that timing attacks are *new* but
2022-03-05 22:28:30	elly	I don't know of any system that is formally proven sidechannel-free
2022-03-05 22:28:34	dzwdz	software can be proved to work correctly within some given assumptions
2022-03-05 22:28:42	bx	though iirc sel4 is verified in gur senes that it assumes gur hw to be unbreachable
2022-03-05 22:28:44	elly	yeah but if those assumptions don't match reality, what is that worth?
2022-03-05 22:28:47	dzwdz	so you assume a bunch of stuff about the cpu that you're using
2022-03-05 22:28:49	malvarma	could you make something as complex as the linux kernel and practically expect it to be free of bugs, or is it only for things that are barebones
2022-03-05 22:28:58	dzwdz	it's still worth knowing that the software is solid
2022-03-05 22:29:01	bx	malvarma: seλ4 is verry barebones
2022-03-05 22:29:03	bx	it has to be lol
2022-03-05 22:29:21	natalia	not to say that formal verifications are useless, but i think the idea of a forever perfect piece of (networking) code is rooted in a lot of bad assumptions
2022-03-05 22:29:32	dzwdz	it's the difference between not trusting either the hardware or software, or trusting the software
2022-03-05 22:29:32	bx	it only really provides threads, mem managment and message parsing
2022-03-05 22:29:36	dzwdz	not perfect, but a big improvement
2022-03-05 22:29:40	malvarma	i definitely think we don't always own the HW we run things on, if it has firmware we can't play with. but you have to make compromises
2022-03-05 22:29:40	juspib	question, do qualcomm chips have a backdoor minix inside like amd and intel?
2022-03-05 22:29:53	elly	the last qualcomm chip I worked with was just running regular linux
2022-03-05 22:30:01	elly	it probably depends on the chip
2022-03-05 22:30:05	dzwdz	dude
2022-03-05 22:30:11	bx	whats counted as regular linux?
2022-03-05 22:30:15	dzwdz	why are you worrying about cpu backdoors when you've just talked about apt
2022-03-05 22:30:18	elly	the linux kernel
2022-03-05 22:30:24	dzwdz	which is a mechanism for running arbitrary code from random people as root
2022-03-05 22:30:30	bx	elly: As in unpactched?
2022-03-05 22:30:34	malvarma	u gotta trust somebody
2022-03-05 22:30:36	twee	not random people
2022-03-05 22:30:39	elly	bx: I have no idea
2022-03-05 22:30:39	juspib	i'm not worrying i'm asking
2022-03-05 22:30:41	dzwdz	literally random people
2022-03-05 22:30:48	natalia	another thing is like, if some microkernel only provides a subset of what you want, are you sure you're not creating a different attack vector in the other independent systems you're bound to need instead?
2022-03-05 22:30:48	dzwdz	i have no reason to trust any of the package maintainers
2022-03-05 22:31:07	dzwdz	or the people writing the software that gets packaged
2022-03-05 22:31:09	dzwdz	etc
2022-03-05 22:31:24	malvarma	there's always r e p r o d u c i b l e  b u i l d s
2022-03-05 22:31:26	dzwdz	natalia: the difference is, kernels require full privileges to the machine
2022-03-05 22:31:32	dzwdz	processes don't
2022-03-05 22:31:38	elly	malvarma: also very difficult
2022-03-05 22:31:42	dzwdz	that other independent system can be isolated
2022-03-05 22:31:43	elly	but cool! and feasible
2022-03-05 22:31:52	dzwdz	malvarma: you still have to trust the source
2022-03-05 22:32:02	dzwdz	your pc depends on billions of lines of code
2022-03-05 22:32:05	dzwdz	have fun reading through all that
2022-03-05 22:32:05	elly	dzwdz: they can theoretically be isolated, but (eg) spectre was specifically about how, on all modern chips, they practically can't be
2022-03-05 22:32:28	dzwdz	which doesn't mean we shouldn't try
2022-03-05 22:32:31	elly	agreed!
2022-03-05 22:32:36	malvarma	i agree. all this stuff is hard, and it always comes down to trust, since nobody can independently audit something as complex as our entire computer systems
2022-03-05 22:32:38	juspib	i trust all random people
2022-03-05 22:32:40	elly	but focusing on it solely as a software problem doesn't seem like the way to go :P
2022-03-05 22:32:48	dzwdz	malvarma: which isn't inherently a property of computers
2022-03-05 22:32:56	juspib	the rule is clear, trust everybody until they do something bad
2022-03-05 22:32:57	dzwdz	it's just how things are at the time
2022-03-05 22:33:05	dzwdz	elly: why?
2022-03-05 22:33:06	twee	i wanted to message my old cello teacher but she's changed jobs so i went on facebook
2022-03-05 22:33:16	twee	it's so weird seeing people from one setting in a different setting
2022-03-05 22:33:20	twee	she loves craft beer
2022-03-05 22:33:21	malvarma	dzwdz: true, we make things too complex. layers upon layers. i think a certain level of complexity does come with the territory though
2022-03-05 22:33:39	dzwdz	we're so fucking far off from the level of complexity needed
2022-03-05 22:33:39	bx	twee: i really thought you were gonna say she works in like heavy industry or something now
2022-03-05 22:34:07	juspib	3.9ghz cpu? no one needs to run that many instructions
2022-03-05 22:34:37	dzwdz	i firmly believe that (on the software side) you can have a system where all the trusted parts are simple enough to be fully understood by a small team if not a single person
2022-03-05 22:34:51	malvarma	we should reduce the complexity where feasible. keep in mind, the politics, economic interests, and politics beneath it all are also complex, and will require some complexity in our technology
2022-03-05 22:35:08	bx	dzwdz: without all gur drivers i'd like to think so as well
2022-03-05 22:35:15	twee	bx: nah she's still a cello teacher, but like seeing her personal facebook timeline, she does long distance swimming, drinks craft beer, collects pineapple paraphenalia (i knew that),,, it's just odd
2022-03-05 22:35:31	malvarma	dzwdz: you could! there are older computers where you could absolutely do that
2022-03-05 22:35:34	bx	long distance swimming sounds good
2022-03-05 22:35:42	dzwdz	bx: i'm not talking about something which'd support all pc setups
2022-03-05 22:36:04	bx	ah
2022-03-05 22:36:24	malvarma	but if you want something more capable than a c64, i think you'd start to escape what one person could keep in their head. even considering all the cruft we could eliminate
2022-03-05 22:36:28	bx	twee: That sounds like when you see a teacher outside of school for gur first time as a kid
2022-03-05 22:36:55	juspib	why would you want something more capable than a c64? c64 did a very good job
2022-03-05 22:37:00	elly	it really depends what functionality you want from the system
2022-03-05 22:37:05	dzwdz	^
2022-03-05 22:37:07	elly	complexity is the price of functionality
2022-03-05 22:37:08	bx	juspib: well i like to have more ram
2022-03-05 22:37:24	elly	if you are fine not having like, wifi or suspend-resume or accelerated graphics or ..., you can write a very small system
2022-03-05 22:37:26	malvarma	the c64 cant run my DAW
2022-03-05 22:37:32	juspib	you don't need lots of software to support more ram
2022-03-05 22:37:49	bx	i meant like enough to draw + animated
2022-03-05 22:37:52	bx	*animate
2022-03-05 22:38:03	twee	twee: i always had a weird expereince of that, because my dad was a teacher so i got to see it from the other side, and new a bunch of my middle school teachers because of my dad already
2022-03-05 22:38:10	elly	software is big because what people want from it is big
2022-03-05 22:38:15	bx	krita can take a couple of gigs on bigger files
2022-03-05 22:38:27	juspib	yea i mean that
2022-03-05 22:38:28	malvarma	software can also be bloated too, lets not forget that
2022-03-05 22:38:36	bx	twee: That sounds even more sureal
2022-03-05 22:38:45	bx	^ what malvarma said
2022-03-05 22:39:01	dzwdz	elly: not only
2022-03-05 22:39:03	bx	all gur people using electron when they could not be is proof of that
2022-03-05 22:39:06	malvarma	but even bloat free, if you want certain things, you pay a price.
2022-03-05 22:39:09	dzwdz	software is also big because of legacy cruft
2022-03-05 22:39:16	twee	bx: yup lol
2022-03-05 22:39:19	dzwdz	software is also big because many programmers just don't care about small code
2022-03-05 22:39:22	elly	bx: they could not be, at the price of more engineer time or less portability or whatever else
2022-03-05 22:39:22	twee	anyways im clocking out now, sleepy times
2022-03-05 22:39:38	juspib	happy sleptime
2022-03-05 22:39:39	elly	electron is not popular for no reason - it's popular because it meets people's needs a lot of the time
2022-03-05 22:39:45	juspib	i fell asleep yesterdsy
2022-03-05 22:39:45	malvarma	even running a barebones computer, like the hypothetical one we are discussing... a person could theoretically hold it all in their head, but i wouldnt wanna expect everyone too
2022-03-05 22:39:46	twee	an experimental composer has asked me to mess around with cello tone with him tomorrow at an ungodly hour
2022-03-05 22:39:48	bx	elly: im honestly not convinced its saving people that much time
2022-03-05 22:39:52	malvarma	twee: gn o/
2022-03-05 22:39:54	bx	maybe in gur short term
2022-03-05 22:39:54	twee	sweet dreams all
2022-03-05 22:39:57	bx	Gn twee
2022-03-05 22:39:59	twee	o/
2022-03-05 22:40:00	dzwdz	malvarma: the point is, that if it's possible
2022-03-05 22:40:07	elly	bx: I encourage you to try making a cross-platform GUI app some other way
2022-03-05 22:40:18	bx	dearimgui is p good
2022-03-05 22:40:21	dzwdz	then the people who can, and who have the experise required, can verify that the system is trustworthy
2022-03-05 22:40:22	juspib	the point is puters are all about trust
2022-03-05 22:40:25	dzwdz	not backdoored in any ways etc
2022-03-05 22:40:30	anton	urgent action: https://stallman.org/archives/2022-jan-apr.html#5_March_2022_(Urgent:_Vacant_US_diplomat_offices)
2022-03-05 22:40:39	juspib	and what's funny is there is no trust because there has been lots of betrayals
2022-03-05 22:40:47	juspib	but puters go on anyway
2022-03-05 22:40:58	malvarma	dzwdz: right. and if you have a more complex system, you have to trust more people to verify each component
2022-03-05 22:41:22	dzwdz	so the bases of our systems should be simple
2022-03-05 22:41:24	malvarma	i agree that we should work to reduce that number as much as possible, and make it simpler and easier to do that verification
2022-03-05 22:41:37	malvarma	yes the bases of our systems should be simple
2022-03-05 22:42:05	elly	the "just write a small os kernel and have people verify it" idea is like, 60 years old at this point
2022-03-05 22:42:27	elly	it has not yet succeeded but maybe some day
2022-03-05 22:42:39	dzwdz	if stuff like seL4 counts
2022-03-05 22:42:43	malvarma	we all have to figure out what we need, understand where we have to compromise, either in what features we give up, or what level of "software freedom" we give up
2022-03-05 22:43:07	malvarma	its not easy and i dont think everyone will reach the same conclusion. but most people dont think about it at all
2022-03-05 22:43:07	dzwdz	then i think the issue is that those kernels make it hard for users to run untrusted software
2022-03-05 22:43:18	juspib	we just need to wait for a super high level programming language so we can implement a kernel in 100 lines
2022-03-05 22:43:19	dzwdz	most of the software that you'll run is impossible to verify
2022-03-05 22:43:35	juspib	and then people will be finding bugs in the language instead of the kernel
2022-03-05 22:43:40	elly	juspib: it doesn't help - then you have to verify the implementation of the language
2022-03-05 22:43:43	elly	right, exactly
2022-03-05 22:44:05	elly	malvarma: yeah, you are basically on point
2022-03-05 22:44:08	dzwdz	so you have neat, tiny kernels like plan 9
2022-03-05 22:44:13	dzwdz	which also trust all software that you run
2022-03-05 22:44:22	juspib	honestly
2022-03-05 22:44:35	elly	security is a feature that you can choose to trade off for features or size or whatever else and for most people the value of it is not that high as long as they aren't getting hacked on the daily
2022-03-05 22:44:36	juspib	we need to wait for chip fabs to be more accessible
2022-03-05 22:44:39	elly	(including me, tbh)
2022-03-05 22:44:49	juspib	and then force everyone to design and fab their own cpus
2022-03-05 22:44:50	anton	https://twitter.com/TobyMargo/status/1500230639844401152 I'm confused on what this was about
2022-03-05 22:44:51	dzwdz	i don't understand why we aren't
2022-03-05 22:44:58	juspib	and write their own systems
2022-03-05 22:45:00	dzwdz	i'm literally running billions of unaudited lines of code
2022-03-05 22:45:05	juspib	and everyone will be happy
2022-03-05 22:45:07	dzwdz	from people who often aren't even getting paid
2022-03-05 22:45:23	elly	because it is mostly not worth the effort to do
2022-03-05 22:45:32	dzwdz	ransomware?
2022-03-05 22:45:44	elly	the returns on ransomwaring random end user devices are probably pretty low
2022-03-05 22:45:47	bx	how much of gur code do we cut out if we remove every optional module from gur kernel?
2022-03-05 22:45:48	elly	especially random *linux* devices
2022-03-05 22:46:06	dzwdz	just power, generally speaking?
2022-03-05 22:46:17	malvarma	there are companies that will probably spend less on ransom than what they lose switching to less powerful software
2022-03-05 22:46:30	elly	there aren't that many people who both have the ability to do supply-chain attacks on big packages and care about having code execution on your laptop
2022-03-05 22:46:32	dzwdz	linux users often have access to lots of shit
2022-03-05 22:46:39	dzwdz	i'm not talking about my laptop lel
2022-03-05 22:46:50	dzwdz	i'm talking about laptops of executives
2022-03-05 22:46:51	juspib	i have access to lots of shit
2022-03-05 22:46:54	elly	well, that's why you aren't hacked all the time :P
2022-03-05 22:47:18	malvarma	gee though, i think we shouldn't use big bloated software thingies to run important infrastructure, and worse of all, hook itup to the internet
2022-03-05 22:47:24	dzwdz	still, it's unsettling that the only reason why is "nobody has bothered to"
2022-03-05 22:47:30	elly	that's how *all* security works
2022-03-05 22:47:37	juspib	no it isn't unsettlimg
2022-03-05 22:47:37	elly	it is all about cost of attack
2022-03-05 22:47:37	dzwdz	...no
2022-03-05 22:47:40	elly	it is
2022-03-05 22:47:47	malvarma	and managing risk
2022-03-05 22:47:50	malvarma	you cant eliminate it
2022-03-05 22:47:54	juspib	not giving a fuck if the most beautiful thing humans do
2022-03-05 22:47:56	elly	it is literally about cost of attack vs cost of defense
2022-03-05 22:48:01	juspib	s/if/is
2022-03-05 22:48:02	sedbot	<juspib> not giving a fuck is the most beautiful thing humans do
2022-03-05 22:48:19	dzwdz	so i know that it doesn't make to talk about security in a purely computing sense
2022-03-05 22:48:29	dzwdz	i've literally just mentioned blackmailing and violence
2022-03-05 22:48:31	dzwdz	but
2022-03-05 22:48:39	dzwdz	if i encrypt something with proper cryptography and there are no breakthroughs
2022-03-05 22:48:47	dzwdz	it's litterally impossible to decrypt, even if you bother to
2022-03-05 22:48:58	dzwdz	now, could you go and beat me up?
2022-03-05 22:49:00	dzwdz	yes
2022-03-05 22:49:07	dzwdz	but that only gives you access to my data
2022-03-05 22:49:10	elly	as I said, all about cost
2022-03-05 22:49:11	juspib	no i couldn't
2022-03-05 22:49:11	dzwdz	supply chain attacks are global
2022-03-05 22:49:15	elly	they aren't
2022-03-05 22:49:15	malvarma	but maybe you care more about the data security than your life
2022-03-05 22:49:26	elly	global ones get found very quickly, in general, and the ones really seen in the wild are targeted
2022-03-05 22:49:27	juspib	dzwdz i would cut my hands off rather than hit u
2022-03-05 22:49:33	dzwdz	<3
2022-03-05 22:49:39	elly	like, compromising *just* the apt mirror you know your target uses
2022-03-05 22:49:42	elly	that sort of thing
2022-03-05 22:50:00	elly	cheaper, easier to go undetected
2022-03-05 22:50:03	dzwdz	log4j
2022-03-05 22:50:09	elly	a classic!
2022-03-05 22:50:21	dzwdz	took a fair bit of time to find
2022-03-05 22:50:25	elly	it's true
2022-03-05 22:50:36	elly	probably a bug, I would guess?
2022-03-05 22:50:39	elly	(and not an attack)
2022-03-05 22:50:42	dzwdz	what does it change?
2022-03-05 22:50:44	elly	but who knows
2022-03-05 22:50:52	dzwdz	the intent doesn't matter
2022-03-05 22:50:57	elly	well, in one sense nothing, but an attacker doesn't have to "pay" to insert bugs someone else inserts
2022-03-05 22:51:06	elly	so buggy software drives cost-of-attack down
2022-03-05 22:51:08	malvarma	i dont think anyone will argue that log4j wasn't a sh*t show. we should expect better, no?
2022-03-05 22:51:24	juspib	i always disliked java
2022-03-05 22:51:28	malvarma	why did i censor shit? sorry
2022-03-05 22:51:40	juspib	just don't install software i dislike and u'll be good
2022-03-05 22:51:48	dzwdz	but also, why should a logging thing have access to the network / anything other than stdout/stderr/the log dirs
2022-03-05 22:52:00	elly	dzwdz: network logging is both real and common
2022-03-05 22:52:05	malvarma	juspib: <3
2022-03-05 22:52:19	dzwdz	why should the logging thing decide where it connects to, though
2022-03-05 22:52:29	elly	dunno, that's just how it's usually designed
2022-03-05 22:52:39	malvarma	dzwdz: well in a 'hardened' system, dont they do stuff like that? remove things that are unnecessary and potentially dangerous?
2022-03-05 22:52:47	elly	yeah
2022-03-05 22:52:49	dzwdz	also access to resources on the system itself is a bigger issue
2022-03-05 22:53:05	dzwdz	actually, how was log4j exploited in the wild
2022-03-05 22:53:15	elly	by causing it to log messages containing strings you controlled
2022-03-05 22:53:20	elly	which were then interpreted by the log formatter
2022-03-05 22:53:23	dzwdz	no but for what
2022-03-05 22:53:28	dzwdz	i know how the exploit worked
2022-03-05 22:53:35	juspib	remember when sudo had a privilege escalation bug in it
2022-03-05 22:53:35	dzwdz	i'm looking up what it was used for
2022-03-05 22:53:42	dzwdz	polkit
2022-03-05 22:53:42	elly	I don't know of any widespread compromises using it
2022-03-05 22:53:59	dzwdz	php had a privilege escalation root because some module runs as root
2022-03-05 22:54:03	dzwdz	because linux security
2022-03-05 22:54:07	dzwdz	s/root/bug
2022-03-05 22:54:09	dzwdz	for 10 years kek
2022-03-05 22:54:11	elly	yea
2022-03-05 22:54:12	piusbird	that was a good show i think
2022-03-05 22:54:21	dzwdz	and it still runs as root, obviously
2022-03-05 22:54:33	dzwdz	because when you shoot yourself in the foot you keep the gun there and just hope not to pull the trigger again
2022-03-05 22:54:49	malvarma	piusbird: it was fun
2022-03-05 22:55:39	piusbird	and I'm getting more comfortable behind the camera every time
2022-03-05 22:55:47	elly	it is... hm, let's call it 5,000 lines of C and assembly to have something that boots and runs something vaguely unix-y on whatever machine you happen to have, assuming that machine is reasonably friendly
2022-03-05 22:55:50	natalia	i feel like a lot of ways people propose security in codebases are not aligned to the way things actually happen. like, log4j i'm pretty sure is small enough for another person to understand it, but nobody did [for a long time]
2022-03-05 22:55:54	elly	I strongly recommend putting your idea into practice
2022-03-05 22:56:12	dzwdz	> unixy
2022-03-05 22:56:22	elly	like, with fork, exec, open, close, read, and write
2022-03-05 22:56:26	dzwdz	ah
2022-03-05 22:56:35	elly	meaning you can create processes, read files off disk, &c
2022-03-05 22:56:42	dzwdz	i was deciding about how snarky i wanted to be about unix's security model
2022-03-05 22:56:50	elly	we used to have students do this in about 12 weeks of time, so
2022-03-05 22:57:00	elly	I suspect it is tractable for one person in not very long
2022-03-05 22:57:04	elly	I encourage you to go do it
2022-03-05 22:57:10	elly	a running demo is worth a lot of manifestos
2022-03-05 22:57:12	dzwdz	i literally have that
2022-03-05 22:57:15	malvarma	i dont wanna scare anyone, but all this talk of the fragility and complexity of computer systems reminds me that the same can be true of most things
2022-03-05 22:57:32	malvarma	and it's frightening, to me!
2022-03-05 22:57:34	juspib	glasses are fragile
2022-03-05 22:57:41	juspib	i dropped one and it broke
2022-03-05 22:57:53	malvarma	juspib: omg like i broke my eyeglasses one time and thank goodness i had a spare pair
2022-03-05 22:58:00	dzwdz	if you're referring to the draft - i've mentioned that i'm writing it because i want to use it to convince the people who can help me take the project further to, well, help me take it further
2022-03-05 22:58:09	malvarma	but now i just have one and im constantly thinking about buying new glasses
2022-03-05 22:58:21	malvarma	but also they are expensive and i dont like how any of them fit, eugh what a mess
2022-03-05 22:58:50	malvarma	piusbird: you have a good energy for streaming. well, im no expert. but i know what i like. it's very laid back and comfortable
2022-03-05 22:58:55	elly	malvarma: and yeah, real
2022-03-05 22:59:06	elly	supply chain disruptions and stuff bring that home for a lot of people
2022-03-05 22:59:11	elly	"oh I guess my supermarket is out of... bread"
2022-03-05 22:59:20	elly	"oh crap my ability to feed myself depends on the efforts of thousands of strangers"
2022-03-05 22:59:28	malvarma	we also should reduce complexity there. but for a lot of things, there's also just flexibility that saves us
2022-03-05 22:59:38	juspib	i meant like glasses you fill with water to drink
2022-03-05 22:59:54	malvarma	like if you run out of coffee, you start making drinks out of chicoree, etc
2022-03-05 23:00:03	juspib	why'd you wear eyeglasses, just start seeing better
2022-03-05 23:00:05	elly	malvarma: yeah
2022-03-05 23:00:08	bx	elly: that quote is like half of my stress towards modern life
2022-03-05 23:00:31	malvarma	eyedoctor: snap out of it!
2022-03-05 23:00:52	elly	malvarma: yeah!
2022-03-05 23:00:55	malvarma	primitive life must be very stressful too though. ever watch that primitive technology guy on youtube?
2022-03-05 23:01:00	elly	in that vein, we have been trying to buy more stuff that comes from around here or close by
2022-03-05 23:01:06	elly	so it is at least like... less brittle
2022-03-05 23:01:23	piusbird	well ty malvarma
2022-03-05 23:01:31	bx	malvarma: i was just thinking like grown within a couple miles
2022-03-05 23:01:36	bx	rather than primitive
2022-03-05 23:01:52	bx	though depending on where you were living primitive sounds kinda calm
2022-03-05 23:01:53	elly	there is a grocery delivery service near here that allows you to filter by that (distance the food travelled to get to you)
2022-03-05 23:01:56	malvarma	elly: ahahaha no joke, i started drinking more yaupon for that reason
2022-03-05 23:01:56	elly	it's very neat
2022-03-05 23:02:32	malvarma	most of the things i eat are probably not too dependent on imports, unless im eating them out of season
2022-03-05 23:02:36	juspib	i think everyone should make their lives depend on imports from Poland
2022-03-05 23:02:44	juspib	that'd be cool
2022-03-05 23:03:27	malvarma	the xkcd comic about modern stacks built on some weird package with one maintainer, but it's keilbasa
2022-03-05 23:03:41	elly	unironically

2022-03-05 23:10:11	malvarma	its probably not good to judge other people's food too harshly
2022-03-05 23:10:11	dzwdz	lent?
2022-03-05 23:10:22	elly	lent!
2022-03-05 23:10:24	elly	malvarma: it is definitely not good
2022-03-05 23:10:43	malvarma	its tradition to sacrafice something for the lenten season. in the past, some people would go without meat or dairy
2022-03-05 23:10:43	dzwdz	oh it's a christian thing
2022-03-05 23:10:45	bx	i like judge it, but not in gur same way id judge other stuff
2022-03-05 23:10:48	elly	yeah
2022-03-05 23:10:49	dzwdz	i just had no idea what it was
2022-03-05 23:11:01	elly	one of my partners and I are vegan-ing for lent
2022-03-05 23:11:11	malvarma	that rules
2022-03-05 23:11:24	juspib	the problem with anomals that eat trash is they don't taste very good
2022-03-05 23:11:26	elly	it is: hard
2022-03-05 23:11:27	dzwdz	i never signed up for eating
2022-03-05 23:11:40	bx	^
2022-03-05 23:11:53	malvarma	you know they say tilapia is a trash fish, but i think they taste fine
2022-03-05 23:12:08	malvarma	very basic fish, not very flavorful, but thats what you need sometimes
2022-03-05 23:12:20	natalia	i would really like to go vegetarian but i have made probably negative progress towards this
2022-03-05 23:12:31	natalia	it will happen but probably not where i am presently
2022-03-05 23:12:34	elly	natalia: I have advice if you want
2022-03-05 23:12:35	juspib	i have never heard of tilapia
2022-03-05 23:12:40	natalia	elly: always appreciate it
2022-03-05 23:12:42	bx	not consuming dairy asside from butter and some chocolates has in fact removed quite a few things from my option
2022-03-05 23:12:51	malvarma	tilapia is a fish you can farm. so it's
2022-03-05 23:12:54	elly	natalia: well, what makes it difficult?
2022-03-05 23:12:56	malvarma	...sustainable?"
2022-03-05 23:13:04	dzwdz	i'm thankful that my colon disease is a rocksolid explanation for my horrible (non-)eating habits
2022-03-05 23:13:19	dzwdz	imagine just eating food like a normal person
2022-03-05 23:13:25	elly	literally can't
2022-03-05 23:13:27	bx	No, i dont think i will
2022-03-05 23:13:30	elly	(eating disorder survivor over here)
2022-03-05 23:13:34	malvarma	tilapia is very cheep too
2022-03-05 23:13:45	bx	"normal" people put sauce on things
2022-03-05 23:13:52	bx	and layer things
2022-03-05 23:13:59	natalia	elly: i live with and partially depend on people who aren't at all interested, mostly!
2022-03-05 23:14:00	juspib	according to wikipedia tilapia lives in africa and levant?
2022-03-05 23:14:04	elly	fact: there is no "normal" way to eat
2022-03-05 23:14:13	bx	true
2022-03-05 23:14:14	malvarma	low levels of mercury! Now i love my swordfish but i dont wanna eat that more than once a year
2022-03-05 23:14:29	juspib	fact: my way to eat is the normal way to eat
2022-03-05 23:14:33	bx	there's mercury in swordfish
2022-03-05 23:14:35	bx	?
2022-03-05 23:14:40	juspib	and i eat when i am hungry or bored
2022-03-05 23:14:42	elly	natalia: ah, gotcha - that is very tough, but IME most meat-eaters will also happily eat vegetarian dishes, at least part of the time
2022-03-05 23:14:56	malvarma	yeah its pretty high in swordfish. but yo, that's like the steak of fish. if i liked steak.
2022-03-05 23:15:08	natalia	another barrier: my knowledge about food and nutrition is awful and i'm not sure where to start. seems like something i just oops! missed out on at the age other people were supposed to Know about it
2022-03-05 23:15:08	elly	like, for example, scrambled eggs + potatos for breakfast, or something
2022-03-05 23:15:17	elly	ooh
2022-03-05 23:15:37	malvarma	oh i dont think anyone teaches people proper nutrition. or cooking. it seems like you just have to be lucky.
2022-03-05 23:15:48	bx	malvarma: i wonder how it gets in there, could you like filter it somehow
2022-03-05 23:15:49	elly	well, there is a lot of stuff out there you can read, but also it's not too hard to do a mostly ok job
2022-03-05 23:15:53	natalia	i would like to first cut out beef and pork probably
2022-03-05 23:15:55	elly	bodies mostly aren't that picky
2022-03-05 23:16:19	bx	elly: uhhhh
2022-03-05 23:16:24	natalia	which i.. honestly i probably do eat less of both of those now; just because the thought of it is less appealing
2022-03-05 23:16:34	malvarma	yeah i dont think you have to pick things apart. just eat a variety of foods, and not too many highly processed ones
2022-03-05 23:16:36	natalia	that wasn ot supposed to be a semicolon
2022-03-05 23:16:40	elly	so you can kinda do like... "each meal has a protein and a carb, I eat leaves at least once a day" and roll with that
2022-03-05 23:16:54	elly	asterisk, if you have special nutritional needs talk to your doctor
2022-03-05 23:17:01	malvarma	plus its dependent on what fits your body and lifestyle
2022-03-05 23:17:05	elly	yeah
2022-03-05 23:17:26	natalia	i need to get better at meal preparation too. i have a pretty long-term low energy for it so i have to work it into a system that works well for me
2022-03-05 23:17:39	elly	the *best* thing to do is, during and after eating, reflect on how you feel, and eat foods that feel good to eat and that you feel good after eating
2022-03-05 23:17:42	elly	that is a good signal
2022-03-05 23:18:10	elly	for cooking, practice more than anything
2022-03-05 23:18:14	elly	practice breeds confidence
2022-03-05 23:18:16	malvarma	im doing a food journal. thats probably not good for someone with an eating disorder. i dont think i have one though
2022-03-05 23:18:25	malvarma	it taught me that i eat a lot of weird things at 1AM
2022-03-05 23:18:33	elly	malvarma: if you want to food journal, and have disordered eating, STRONG STRONG recommend for Recovery Record
2022-03-05 23:18:51	malvarma	right, you had showed me that
2022-03-05 23:19:11	malvarma	i read more of your post after that. it's fascinating the thought they put into making a program that supports people
2022-03-05 23:19:15	elly	yeah :)
2022-03-05 23:19:17	dzwdz	> eat foods that feel good to eat
2022-03-05 23:19:22	dzwdz	aaaaand how do you find those?
2022-03-05 23:19:28	dzwdz	when i look for recipes, 99% look repulsing
2022-03-05 23:19:44	malvarma	its almost as much effort that some companies put into how to manipulate and exploit people
2022-03-05 23:19:46	elly	I do it by sometimes trying things even if I think I will dislike them
2022-03-05 23:19:52	elly	not always, but sometimes
2022-03-05 23:20:04	malvarma	its good to see that better things ar possible, if we work together
2022-03-05 23:20:08	elly	malvarma: indeed
2022-03-05 23:20:10	dzwdz	it's so fucking hard though
2022-03-05 23:20:16	elly	a lot of worthwhile things are hard
2022-03-05 23:20:33	bx	most in fact
2022-03-05 23:20:36	malvarma	dzwdz: what do you like to eat normally?
2022-03-05 23:20:45	elly	it took me a long time to develop food habits and routines that support my life instead of detracting from it
2022-03-05 23:20:48	 *	bx should try and get back into eating apples/beats
2022-03-05 23:20:49	elly	but it was highly worthwhile
2022-03-05 23:20:58	dzwdz	malvarma: i don't really want to talk about that, sorry
2022-03-05 23:21:04	malvarma	no worries i get it
2022-03-05 23:21:57	dzwdz	my current plan for dealing with this is:
2022-03-05 23:21:59	dzwdz	don't
2022-03-05 23:22:20	bx	most unfamiliar/odd food textures my brain kinda like, rejects
2022-03-05 23:22:26	dzwdz	and then once i have a partner hope that instead of being a dealbreaker for them, they'll help me guide that somehow
2022-03-05 23:22:27	elly	bx: valid
2022-03-05 23:22:44	malvarma	if you have a difficult relationship with food, or you are averse to many foods, then looking for recipies is besides the point
2022-03-05 23:23:06	bx	it takes me like a long time to adjust to a new one
2022-03-05 23:23:06	elly	I had a nutritionist who was a big help to me, also
2022-03-05 23:23:16	elly	both in terms of finding foods and in terms of getting confident with food and cooking
2022-03-05 23:23:23	bx	That seems like a smart move
2022-03-05 23:23:32	bx	i mostly like cooking
2022-03-05 23:23:37	dzwdz	i talked to my therapist about this but she didn't help much at all
2022-03-05 23:23:48	elly	yeah, you want a nutrition specialist generally
2022-03-05 23:24:00	dzwdz	but
2022-03-05 23:24:18	dzwdz	considering that this won't affect me until i start living with other people
2022-03-05 23:24:26	dzwdz	i've mentioned the plan
2022-03-05 23:24:34	elly	you do you
2022-03-05 23:24:42	malvarma	take it one step at a time
2022-03-05 23:25:11	elly	natalia: btw, one more tip for being with non-vegetarians: cook, and produce a meal that is mostly vegetarian, has a meat component for them, and a non-meat replacement component for you
2022-03-05 23:25:38	natalia	i like that one :)
2022-03-05 23:25:50	dzwdz	i'd love to switch to vegetarianism if i was able to
2022-03-05 23:26:07	elly	natalia: it works well! our old household in new york had 2 vegans, 2 vegetarians, and one person who really liked meat
2022-03-05 23:26:12	elly	and we made it work by having meals that were parts like that
2022-03-05 23:26:55	malvarma	i knew a guy who had food issues, and started the soylent thing, and i thought it was odd, but it helped him actually eat stuff besides pizza, so now i dont make soylent jokes
2022-03-05 23:27:08	dzwdz	soylent?
2022-03-05 23:27:24	elly	malvarma: yeah! soylent used to be a one of my main depression foods
2022-03-05 23:27:27	dzwdz	oh is that just like liquid food
2022-03-05 23:27:30	malvarma	which i totally did, when it came out, because of the hubris of some hacker news bro thinking they could just crush up vitimins and put it ini a drink
2022-03-05 23:27:39	malvarma	and that would be all you need
2022-03-05 23:27:47	bx	i take it that did not work?
2022-03-05 23:27:56	natalia	tbh, being vegetarian is mostly a subset of like, properly doing Food In General for me, which i need a lot of work to work out
2022-03-05 23:27:56	elly	the like "can't get myself to prepare even a simple meal but at least I can drink this" worked well for me
2022-03-05 23:28:04	natalia	and some of that might just depend on weird mental state things for me but i'm okay with that
2022-03-05 23:28:10	malvarma	and i still have reservations about the company, but i see that it does have a use for people who supplement their meals with it. though it's probably a bit expensive
2022-03-05 23:28:20	elly	natalia: for me, the real thing I had to put a lot of work into was making conscious and deliberate food choices
2022-03-05 23:28:27	elly	vs picking stuff because it was convenient or for emotional reasons
2022-03-05 23:28:50	elly	once I was able to get that change to mostly stick, then it was a lot easier to adjust anything else
2022-03-05 23:29:32	malvarma	some days im bagel, other days im pizza
2022-03-05 23:29:43	juspib	hot take
2022-03-05 23:29:48	juspib	food is cringe
2022-03-05 23:29:48	elly	valid to eat pizza or bagels
2022-03-05 23:29:53	elly	juspib: terrible take
2022-03-05 23:29:56	dzwdz	juspib: good take
2022-03-05 23:29:59	natalia	food is BASED
2022-03-05 23:30:04	dzwdz	on what
2022-03-05 23:30:08	malvarma	organic chemistry
2022-03-05 23:30:14	elly	carbon compounds, yeah
2022-03-05 23:30:17	juspib	based on deez nuts
2022-03-05 23:30:22	dzwdz	:ooooooooo
2022-03-05 23:30:26	malvarma	nuts are food and thats cringe
2022-03-05 23:30:37	dzwdz	depends on the kind of nuts
2022-03-05 23:30:45	malvarma	true
2022-03-05 23:30:52	dzwdz	i suppose the other kind is eatable too
2022-03-05 23:31:02	malvarma	well testicles are afood too. they call them rocky mountain oysters
2022-03-05 23:31:10	bx	i like pistachios, but taking gur shells off is kinda a time sink
2022-03-05 23:31:25	bx	malvarma: wait what
2022-03-05 23:31:36	bx	is it gur teste OF an oyseter?
2022-03-05 23:31:41	juspib	i like my sunflower seeds crunchy
2022-03-05 23:31:43	elly	of a bull
2022-03-05 23:32:17	bx	Oh
2022-03-05 23:32:52	bx	do you get any extra nutrition out of it
2022-03-05 23:33:31	elly	in re: food knowledge: I really like this post https://www.grubstreet.com/2018/03/ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutrition.html
2022-03-05 23:34:44	malvarma	bx yes its some kind of meat, you get callories
2022-03-05 23:34:48	malvarma	i have never eaten such a thing
2022-03-05 23:35:16	malvarma	i have strict dietary laws, that i tell people are religious, but actually it's just my food preferences encoded into law
2022-03-05 23:35:51	elly	do you like them?
2022-03-05 23:37:03	juspib	my organism has two rules regarding food, 1. no bad food 2. no meat in soups, unless it's sausage
2022-03-05 23:37:08	malvarma	no cow parts for me. just milk. that should gross me out. but it doesnt
2022-03-05 23:38:10	malvarma	im drinking milk. from a cow. how is that not weird
2022-03-05 23:38:43	malvarma	oh well in other news, i should get going. wishing everyone a happy whatever day it is, and a fruitful whatever tomorrow is!
2022-03-05 23:38:48	bx	elly: this is an intresting article
2022-03-05 23:38:50	dzwdz	cya
2022-03-05 23:38:52	malvarma	good night morning
2022-03-05 23:38:56	<--	malvarma (malvarma@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
2022-03-05 23:38:59	juspib	happy sleeping
2022-03-05 23:39:09	juspib	i have some good sleeps lately
2022-03-05 23:39:09	bx	laters malvarma
2022-03-05 23:39:17	elly	bx: it is very good
2022-03-05 23:39:39	dzwdz	what's it about?
2022-03-05 23:39:54	dzwdz	healthy eating as in physically healthy or also mentally healthy
2022-03-05 23:40:43	bx	so far this seems to be physically
2022-03-05 23:40:51	bx	thought im not all gur way thru
2022-03-05 23:40:54	elly	physically, yeah
2022-03-05 23:41:02	elly	it doesn't talk about the mental health aspects of eating at all
2022-03-05 23:41:06	dzwdz	ah
2022-03-05 23:41:13	dzwdz	not what i expected considering how this convo was going
2022-03-05 23:41:33	elly	yeah, I was replying to natalia mentioning earlier that they don't really know much about how to eat in a nourishing way
2022-03-05 23:42:28	natalia	aha re this article
2022-03-05 23:42:28	dzwdz	ahh
2022-03-05 23:42:38	natalia	What happens if I eat too much yogurt?
2022-03-05 23:42:40	natalia	﻿We have no idea. Probably you get full.
2022-03-05 23:42:45	elly	haha yes
2022-03-05 23:45:30	dzwdz	i wonder what would be the implications of some scifi drug that'd let people photosynthesise
2022-03-05 23:46:27	elly	if we got energy from sunlight? that would be rad
2022-03-05 23:46:39	bx	you probs wont get much though
2022-03-05 23:46:46	dzwdz	fuck yeah it would
2022-03-05 23:46:54	elly	we don't have much surface area compared to plants, it's true
2022-03-05 23:46:57	bx	plants dont have gur energy to have muscles for a reason
2022-03-05 23:46:58	dzwdz	but it also sounds like something that an interesting story could be written about
2022-03-05 23:47:03	bx	Truue
2022-03-05 23:47:13	bx	i'd be down to just eat soil and water
2022-03-05 23:47:17	dzwdz	we could sleep for longer in the sunlight
2022-03-05 23:47:21	bx	and have leaves on my head
2022-03-05 23:47:23	dzwdz	and be active in the night
2022-03-05 23:47:28	dzwdz	like a shittier version of vampires
2022-03-05 23:47:38	elly	I think we would probably still need other food to get the right nutrients
2022-03-05 23:48:10	dzwdz	hm
2022-03-05 23:48:25	dzwdz	i was picturing a world where you could live only off photosynthesis
2022-03-05 23:48:44	elly	ah, that would be a pretty big change
2022-03-05 23:48:47	dzwdz	any other ways we could get energy other than photosynthesis?
2022-03-05 23:48:51	dzwdz	that don't require eating
2022-03-05 23:48:53	elly	photosynthesis produces glucose from sunlight but you need a lot of other stuff to live
2022-03-05 23:48:56	dzwdz	we could modify the premise a bit
2022-03-05 23:48:56	elly	like, vitamins and minerals
2022-03-05 23:49:16	elly	but maybe you could take a drug that both contains those vitamins/minerals and makes you photosynthesize
2022-03-05 23:50:11	bx	or eat soil!
2022-03-05 23:50:31	dzwdz	i'll pass, the area i live in is way too polluted
2022-03-05 23:50:31	extratone	if any of you are looking for stuff to watch, legitimately the most creative yearly event I know of is about to happen. https://youtu.be/_CGCIKqHhp0
2022-03-05 23:50:46	elly	what is it?
2022-03-05 23:51:06	extratone	it's hard to describe, but it's called the Viyda Gaem Awards.
2022-03-05 23:51:21	extratone	I always describe it to people as the most insane motion graphics flex I've ever seen lol
2022-03-05 23:51:32	extratone	I do not play or follow video games but I watch every year.
2022-03-05 23:52:31	bx	after watching gur "Danger humans" video and reading some of deathworlders, ive wondered what a planet where plant like things are gur most inflential species would look like, would they maybe have gur normal ground based plant bodies with a moving bit that is is thetherd/undocks
2022-03-05 23:53:08	bx	kinda being like humans but instead of consuming gur plants their integerated as one being, they give over gur nutrients willingly as an extention of gur body, rather than as food
2022-03-05 23:53:15	dzwdz	i went to their channel, clicked on a random old video
2022-03-05 23:53:20	dzwdz	skipped to a random portion
2022-03-05 23:53:27	dzwdz	and they're saying r*tard over and over again
2022-03-05 23:53:30	dzwdz	great look
2022-03-05 23:53:37	extratone	REALLY??? the VGAs????
2022-03-05 23:53:56	dzwdz	2019 director's cut, blue checkmark award
2022-03-05 23:54:07	extratone	I'm sorry I had no idea. 
2022-03-05 23:54:11	dzwdz	lol np
2022-03-05 23:54:24	extratone	I watched that show! not the director's cut though.
2022-03-05 23:54:59	extratone	that's weird because my family will freely use the n word but the r word is absolutely banned. I'm surprised I didn' pick it up.
2022-03-05 23:55:10	dzwdz	wait wait hold up
2022-03-05 23:55:14	dzwdz	aren't you white
2022-03-05 23:56:36	extratone	yes. I shouldn't say "freely" like it happens often, but my siblings are terrible people tbh.
2022-03-05 23:56:56	extratone	two of my sisters are members of Moms for Liberty - the people taking books away from children.
2022-03-05 23:57:09	elly	yuck
2022-03-05 23:57:20	bx	that's sad
2022-03-05 23:58:00	dzwdz	oh those guys
2022-03-05 23:58:06	extratone	that issue in particular is hateful imo. but yeah the ignorance is sad in general.
2022-03-05 23:58:29	extratone	but no r word! lol

2022-03-06 00:06:38	natalia	playing with cqueues today, for an irc bot
2022-03-06 00:07:06	natalia	if i am being honest it is frankly a little annoying
2022-03-06 00:07:50	natalia	it promises (and delivers!) a nice polling-based async system for lua, but like, it only provides networking utilities to do so, and you have to rewrite a lot of what is basically the same code anyway to provide a similar interface for, say, asyncronously reading lines from a file
2022-03-06 00:08:42	elly	time for upstream patches? :)
2022-03-06 00:10:07	natalia	maybe! :)
2022-03-06 00:10:44	natalia	tbh, there's probably a lot of good, socket-dependent reasons why it only exposes a socket interface; i mean like, i have to rewrite the same code, but they would probably have to make significant changes too
2022-03-06 00:11:32	natalia	however cqueues IS smart and like, i can make my own non-blocking interfaces on file descriptors -- i can probably make a nice just-lua-and-luaposix library for it
2022-03-06 00:17:36	extratone	I think I just successfully edited my weechat config file for the first time.
2022-03-06 00:17:45	extratone	*applause*

2022-03-06 00:28:55	llamanator	Does town chat notify everyone whenever someone joins and leaves the chat? How does everyone have this client open all the time?
2022-03-06 00:29:26	petra	Normally people have joins and parts set to, at minimum, not send notifications
2022-03-06 00:29:31	natalia	does town chat notify: yes, as do all irc rooms, but some people hide the messages
2022-03-06 00:29:48	natalia	how: with tmux usually--oh i think i. misread the question
2022-03-06 00:31:08	extratone	now imagine keeping it open all the time on your multitasking-throttled cecullar telephone.
2022-03-06 00:31:25	elly	I have joins/parts/quits hidden in irssi
2022-03-06 00:31:39	elly	but yeah people definitely leave clients open

2022-03-06 00:37:31	natalia	the cqueues code has F U L L S P A C E headers
2022-03-06 00:37:39	natalia	not like actual fullspace just space-spaced
2022-03-06 00:42:16	extratone	grandfather clocks are cool.
2022-03-06 00:47:55	llamanator	They have a somewhat rustic and old school charm to them for me.
2022-03-06 00:49:37	extratone	they can also terrify, which is a plus.
2022-03-06 00:49:58	extratone	the louder the bong the better in my (nonexistant) household

2022-03-06 11:16:23	the_default	there were a few job listings a while back for cleaners that i honestly considered applying for. they actually paid well (considering they're hiring unskilled teenagers)
2022-03-06 11:16:29	the_default	but i just have no time
2022-03-06 11:16:37	the_default	maybe when i get my shit together

2022-03-06 11:20:45	extratone	but maybe that's because I just talk about me lol.
2022-03-06 11:21:07	extratone	cleaning in general? or a specific type of cleaning?

2022-03-06 12:17:37	the_default	it is so good at what it does
2022-03-06 12:17:48	the_default	but does it in a horrible adobe AIR way
2022-03-06 12:17:52	the_default	with floating windows
2022-03-06 12:17:59	the_default	that don't play nice with my tiling wm

2022-03-06 12:18:04	the_default	it's so jank
2022-03-06 12:18:14	the_default	and because it runs in actionscript
2022-03-06 12:18:15	dzwdz	does your wm not support floating mode?
2022-03-06 12:18:25	dzwdz	oh god, that's a name i haven't heard in a long time
2022-03-06 12:18:32	the_default	it does, it's just this app (running in wine), really doesnt like it
2022-03-06 12:18:50	the_default	who tf is like: ok we need to deal with transforming large images, time to use actionscript
2022-03-06 12:19:29	the_default	and i know, i'm complaining about stuff i don't understand
2022-03-06 12:19:31	the_default	but still
2022-03-06 12:19:57	dzwdz	they just used whatever they had experience with
2022-03-06 12:20:29	the_default	yeah, i know that's the real answer. more suprised i couldn't easily find a modern replacement
2022-03-06 12:20:40	the_default	that's probably me being lazy with google

2022-03-06 14:52:18	palmdrop	a lot better than the last place that was on ground level
2022-03-06 14:52:58	bx	>baby mountains
2022-03-06 14:53:05	bx	thats a nice way of putting it

2022-03-06 14:55:57	bx	it looks really pretty
2022-03-06 14:56:11	bx	but i have no idea whats going on with those side bits, are tehy textures ?
2022-03-06 14:56:25	palmdrop	I like interfaces and want to play around with them
2022-03-06 14:56:41	palmdrop	if you hover the 3d shape in the middle the images on the sides will change
2022-03-06 14:56:48	palmdrop	the textures are zooms from photos
2022-03-06 14:57:04	palmdrop	that's the project, sort of, grabbing textures/details/patterns from photos I take
2022-03-06 14:58:19	bx	OH
2022-03-06 14:58:23	bx	I was clicking on gur textures lol
2022-03-06 14:59:57	bx	do you know those chinese lanterns?
2022-03-06 15:00:08	bx	gur ones that float after you light them
2022-03-06 15:00:16	palmdrop	yeah
2022-03-06 15:00:33	bx	gur colours on what ive gotten remind me of that, a nice warm vibe
2022-03-06 15:00:43	palmdrop	some of them will do that
2022-03-06 15:01:32	palmdrop	fun fact the 3d thing is based on html/css so you can rightclick any image and save it or open in a tab
2022-03-06 15:01:34	bx	I like it allot, thanks for sharing it
2022-03-06 15:01:40	palmdrop	glad you liked it
2022-03-06 15:01:45	bx	wait what
2022-03-06 15:01:50	bx	i assumed this was webgl
2022-03-06 15:03:16	bx	is there a place i can view gur code for it ?
2022-03-06 15:03:38	palmdrop	https://github.com/palmdrop/slices
2022-03-06 15:03:51	palmdrop	it's a svelte app with three.js using the CSS3DRenderer
2022-03-06 15:04:04	palmdrop	so no webgl canvas, but three.js for 3d transformations
2022-03-06 15:04:22	bx	threejs has a cssrenderer?
2022-03-06 15:04:37	palmdrop	yes!
2022-03-06 15:04:51	palmdrop	or, it's not in the main bundle
2022-03-06 15:04:54	bx	its been too long since i played with it, but i was amazed that you could do 3d games in a browser as a teenager
2022-03-06 15:05:35	bx	why 1000x707px
2022-03-06 15:05:41	palmdrop	browsers have become insanely powerful
2022-03-06 15:05:56	palmdrop	because golden ratio haha
2022-03-06 15:06:10	palmdrop	or hmm
2022-03-06 15:06:28	bx	golden ratio?
2022-03-06 15:06:43	extratone	does anyone recognize this ringtone?
2022-03-06 15:06:44	extratone	https://sndup.net/f79d
2022-03-06 15:07:06	extratone	golden ration definitely has to do with pee.
2022-03-06 15:07:09	extratone	ratio*
2022-03-06 15:07:30	palmdrop	not sure 1000x707 actually is the golden ratio
2022-03-06 15:09:22	palmdrop	it's not. I thought that was why I picked it
2022-03-06 15:10:04	bx	so
2022-03-06 15:10:04	palmdrop	but well it's based on sqrt(2). 1000/sqrt(2) === 707
2022-03-06 15:10:30	bx	whats so good about sqrt(2)?
2022-03-06 15:10:50	palmdrop	if you split the long side in half
2022-03-06 15:10:58	palmdrop	the two new parts will have the same proportions

2022-03-06 15:24:30	palmdrop	luckily we don't have to worry about powering the washing machine or dryer, we got a shared one on our floor
2022-03-06 15:24:49	palmdrop	well anyone on our floor can walk in and steal clothes if they like
2022-03-06 15:24:55	bx	ah

2022-03-06 15:28:58	dzwdz	odds on getting called a faggot in school?
2022-03-06 15:29:52	bx	idk, polish school sounds harsher on that
2022-03-06 15:30:04	bx	though
2022-03-06 15:30:12	bx	i also might have a skewed image
2022-03-06 15:36:21	juspib	i give it 5% though idk your school
2022-03-06 15:41:24	nihilazo	important question
2022-03-06 15:41:28	nihilazo	if you name something, does that make it yours
2022-03-06 15:41:42	bx	no
2022-03-06 15:41:49	bx	people name thier children
2022-03-06 15:42:03	bx	and also i name allot of rodents and bugs
2022-03-06 15:42:12	bx	they just kinda exist in gur garden
2022-03-06 15:42:17	juspib	if you name it then it means that you named it
2022-03-06 15:42:26	dzwdz	if you give someone a nickname then they're yours
2022-03-06 15:42:36	nihilazo	dzwdz no
2022-03-06 15:42:50	nihilazo	go to horny jail
2022-03-06 15:42:56	bx	dzwdz: what if they dont like gur nickname
2022-03-06 15:42:57	dzwdz	dude what
2022-03-06 15:43:06	dzwdz	i was thinking slavery
2022-03-06 15:43:08	dzwdz	perv
2022-03-06 15:43:20	nihilazo	giving somebody a nickname makes them a slave????
2022-03-06 15:43:22	dzwdz	bx: they have to
2022-03-06 15:43:24	dzwdz	yes
2022-03-06 15:43:29	dzwdz	nico
2022-03-06 15:43:35	nihilazo	what are you smoking rn dz
2022-03-06 15:43:45	dzwdz	> if you name something, does that make it yours
2022-03-06 15:43:49	dzwdz	it's the logical conclusion?
2022-03-06 15:43:57	nihilazo	what the fuck
2022-03-06 15:44:11	dzwdz	depends on your exact definition of owning a human i guess
2022-03-06 15:44:27	nihilazo	we're not talking about the ownership of humans, we're only talking about names
2022-03-06 15:44:34	nihilazo	specifically the name of a toy shark
2022-03-06 15:44:42	nihilazo	for the shark thief is back
2022-03-06 15:44:45	juspib	you own a human when you can take their kidney and they won't be upset
2022-03-06 15:44:53	bx	nihilazo: i mean it was already your shark
2022-03-06 15:44:57	dzwdz	name the shark thief
2022-03-06 15:45:03	juspib	gregory
2022-03-06 15:45:16	dzwdz	wait, are they using that argument?
2022-03-06 15:45:22	nihilazo	yes
2022-03-06 15:45:26	bx	well they wrong
2022-03-06 15:45:30	dzwdz	give them a nickname and say that you own them now
2022-03-06 15:45:32	nihilazo	they say that they own the shark because they named it
2022-03-06 15:45:44	nihilazo	no because they already named themselves
2022-03-06 15:45:50	nihilazo	I can't rename them
2022-03-06 15:45:54	dzwdz	things have more than one name
2022-03-06 15:45:57	bx	^
2022-03-06 15:45:58	dzwdz	you're both nico and nihilazo
2022-03-06 15:46:02	dzwdz	and things can have more than one owner

2022-03-06 16:03:52	dzwdz	why

2022-03-06 16:04:15	nihilazo	you give them a name
2022-03-06 16:04:20	dzwdz	then ask them what name they want
2022-03-06 16:04:22	dzwdz	and give it to them
2022-03-06 16:04:31	dzwdz	do it sneakily though
2022-03-06 16:04:35	dzwdz	so they don't name themselves
2022-03-06 16:04:42	nihilazo	how do you give somebody a name sneakily
2022-03-06 16:04:50	dzwdz	like "yo if you had to choose a different name for yourself, what would it be"
2022-03-06 16:04:54	dzwdz	then they answer "bob"
2022-03-06 16:05:16	nihilazo	o
2022-03-06 16:05:19	dzwdz	then you say "boom i name your bob, now i own you"

2022-03-08 16:06:54	elly	oh yeah, I think that was meant to happen
2022-03-08 16:06:58	@natalia	morning
2022-03-08 16:07:05	elly	I don't see any news coverage about it at the moment, maybe it is ongoing
2022-03-08 16:07:44	zyloh	from what i can tell it hasn't started yet
2022-03-08 16:11:55	arisotura	hi
2022-03-08 16:12:00	arisotura	how are you folks
2022-03-08 16:12:07	extratone	my town picked a great time to have "weather week" where they randomnly test the sirens.
2022-03-08 16:12:10	default	hey arisotura!
2022-03-08 16:12:15	elly	hello!
2022-03-08 16:12:27	elly	I am trying to think of what my goals are for this workday
2022-03-08 16:13:02	zyloh	hiya
2022-03-08 16:15:38	juspib	busy times in the white house
2022-03-08 16:20:33	extratone	I'm sure all of you have taken off work because there's an apple event today.
2022-03-08 16:20:44	extratone	(yes, there are regular people who actually do that.)
2022-03-08 16:20:57	extratone	even though they're pre-filmed now.
2022-03-08 16:26:14	ellie	morning all
2022-03-08 16:26:35	ellie	lol hearing about all these events is reminding me how much i should be paying attention to this sorta stuff
2022-03-08 16:27:18	elly	especially if you ship software for mac or iOS they are usually worth paying attention to
2022-03-08 16:29:15	ellie	hmm, true
2022-03-08 16:33:21	extratone	well I can tell you - having watched every one live for the past two years - they're not fun anymore.
2022-03-08 16:33:42	elly	indeed
2022-03-08 16:33:49	elly	I also generally watch them and they are not really fun
2022-03-08 16:33:51	extratone	and paying attention to the amount of hype is just deeply alarming now.
2022-03-08 16:34:00	elly	but like, the first time they told us we were all going to have to port to arm64 was at an event
2022-03-08 16:34:04	elly	so, worth knowing about :P
2022-03-08 16:34:36	extratone	if only there was a publication you could trust to quickly outline the important bullet points of an apple event lol
2022-03-08 16:34:44	elly	if only
2022-03-08 16:37:00	extratone	sometimes I allow myself to daydream about starting a modern technology publication that’s actually about technology.
2022-03-08 16:42:47	piusbird	oh i did something boneheaded when developing my inital irc bot and it's going to cause problems on todays stream
2022-03-08 16:43:09	extratone	how dare you!
2022-03-08 16:43:24	piusbird	but we'll turn it into a lesson
2022-03-08 16:43:39	twee	apple event?  im so out of the loop of any such event
2022-03-08 16:43:41	extratone	that's very clever.
2022-03-08 16:43:56	extratone	I was completely joking when I brought it up lol
2022-03-08 16:44:02	twee	last one i actually heard anything about beforehand was the apple watch one, like seven years ago
2022-03-08 16:44:11	piusbird	because now i need to use an IPC socket to get around it
2022-03-08 16:44:39	piusbird	ha-ha-ho-ho-he-he
2022-03-08 16:44:58	extratone	I won’t do my usual rant but it’s essentially: think about how ridiculous the whole concept of making predictions before events held by the most proprietary-ass organization on earth.
2022-03-08 16:45:06	extratone	is
2022-03-08 16:45:49	twee	i hope they announce the ipod
2022-03-08 16:46:19	extratone	^
2022-03-08 16:47:27	default	gimme the scroll wheel
2022-03-08 16:48:43	twee	scroll wheels are hot
2022-03-08 16:51:40	extratone	I missed the scroll wheel but have maintained that my first generation iPod Shuffle (the one that was a USB drive with buttons and a 3.5mm jack, basically) was the highest value consumer tech product I’ve ever owned.
2022-03-08 16:54:25	default	OH
2022-03-08 16:54:56	default	lmao. i've been needing a little mp3 player so i can move around my room while listening to music
2022-03-08 16:55:03	default	forgot all about my lil shuffle
2022-03-08 16:55:11	default	s/my/my mum's/
2022-03-08 16:55:12	sedbot	<default> forgot all about my mum's lil shuffle
2022-03-08 16:58:12	twee	i knew someone once who owned an ipod shuffle, it was great
2022-03-08 16:58:21	twee	very cool
2022-03-08 16:59:12	default	huh the original ipod had an hdd
2022-03-08 16:59:26	twee	a very small one
2022-03-08 16:59:31	extratone	yup. you could feel it rotating too.
2022-03-08 16:59:32	twee	smallest hdd ever
2022-03-08 16:59:33	twee	or something
2022-03-08 16:59:47	twee	i remember watching steve jobs talk about the tiny hard drive
2022-03-08 17:00:27	dzwdz	well someone didn't watch dankpods
2022-03-08 17:00:48	default	i wonder if the original ipod's still hanging around somewhere downstairs
2022-03-08 17:00:50	default	brb
2022-03-08 17:11:50	juspib	if the eu manages to cut russian oil/gas imports that'll be huge
2022-03-08 17:14:52	dozens	this was my favorite ipod -- https://ttm.sh/iJi.jpg
2022-03-08 17:15:20	dozens	put roxbox on that bad boy and rock out
2022-03-08 17:17:33	extratone	gorg. and good cuticles.
2022-03-08 17:18:35	extratone	lthe idea that it’s a serious questions Americans are apparently asking ourselves: are we willing to pay more for gas for a free Ukraine?
2022-03-08 17:19:29	kirch	!sotd https://youtu.be/lWQb_T9_nwA
2022-03-08 17:20:37	twee	yeah they are some good hands
2022-03-08 17:20:43	<--	default (the_default@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
2022-03-08 17:21:43	twee	my favourite was the ipod nano g2
2022-03-08 17:22:18	dozens	guys they are not my hands
2022-03-08 17:22:37	dozens	if they were, i would have an onlyhands account
2022-03-08 17:22:45	dozens	because i would be a hand model
2022-03-08 17:25:13	extratone	wait is onlyhands a thing.
2022-03-08 17:25:21	extratone	also what the hell is "WiFi 6."
2022-03-08 17:26:04	twee	searched onlyhands and nfts came up :/
2022-03-08 17:26:15	elly	extratone: 802.11ax
2022-03-08 17:26:45	extratone	is it necessary? did anyone ask for it?
2022-03-08 17:26:49	elly	yes
2022-03-08 17:26:56	elly	people always want more range, throughput, and signal quality for wifi
2022-03-08 17:27:06	elly	well, "necessary" is of course subjective
2022-03-08 17:27:09	elly	but it definitely has an audience
2022-03-08 17:27:25	twee	95% approval in the sponsor ballot
2022-03-08 17:27:30	twee	whatever that means but it seems popular
2022-03-08 17:32:47	extratone	does anybody want to see my funniest apple event tweet. it's okay if no.
2022-03-08 17:34:27	piusbird	sure
2022-03-08 17:34:47	extratone	https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1437857453174108163
2022-03-08 17:49:49	juspib	wifi 6 is like wifi 5 but better
2022-03-08 17:50:01	dzwdz	it's 120% normal wifi
2022-03-08 17:50:19	juspib	unless you're with the slow movement, in which case it's worse
2022-03-08 17:50:35	elly	it's specifically better designed for busy RF environments
2022-03-08 17:50:48	elly	which, as someone who has like 50 overlapping wifi networks in range of their house, I appreciate :P
2022-03-08 17:51:22	juspib	and wifi 7 appears to be just a flex for now
2022-03-08 17:52:15	twee	extratone: cant lie i dont get it
2022-03-08 17:52:19	juspib	regarding cutting edge, am5 socket when?
2022-03-08 17:53:07	extratone	twee, basically I find the whole idea of huge phone funny, but the idea is that they are preventing me from leaving.
2022-03-08 17:53:18	extratone	big bully phones.
2022-03-08 17:54:05	juspib	back in the day you had to keep your phone connected to the wall to make calls
2022-03-08 17:55:18	twee	extratone: i seee
2022-03-08 17:55:20	twee	i have a tiny phone
2022-03-08 17:55:36	twee	https://www.unihertz.com/products/jelly-2
2022-03-08 17:56:45	extratone	cute. and I do not mean that in demeaning way at all.
2022-03-08 17:56:51	extratone	a*
2022-03-08 17:56:54	dzwdz	that's cool
2022-03-08 17:57:04	dzwdz	but reading anything on it would be a paiiiin
2022-03-08 17:57:14	extratone	read a book
2022-03-08 17:57:44	elly	ok, that is definitely an adorable phone
2022-03-08 17:57:48	extratone	one of the things I’ve actually been astonished by - revisiting the iPhone 4S in the past few weeks - has been how much I enjoy reading on it.
2022-03-08 17:58:08	elly	I would really like if my next phone fit in my jeans pockets again
2022-03-08 17:58:29	dzwdz	cargo pants ftw
2022-03-08 17:58:49	elly	my old iPhone 5S and 5SE both fit
2022-03-08 17:58:53	elly	but my new phone is far too big
2022-03-08 17:59:06	twee	small phones are so nice
2022-03-08 17:59:07	-->	arplo (arplo@localhost) has joined #tildetown
2022-03-08 17:59:22	twee	using someones big (or normal i guess) sized phone feels so huuuge
2022-03-08 17:59:31	dzwdz	don't women's pants have smaller pockets?
2022-03-08 17:59:48	elly	they definitely do
2022-03-08 17:59:53	dzwdz	WAIT IS THERE A CARGO DRESS
2022-03-08 17:59:55	elly	far, far smaller
2022-03-08 17:59:59	dzwdz	oh god there is
2022-03-08 18:00:18	dzwdz	https://i.pinimg.com/originals/72/5c/82/725c829433b7544556832d9d87915101.jpg
2022-03-08 18:00:25	elly	the design intent is like, smaller pockets break up your outline less, and you are kinda assumed to have a purse with you anyway
2022-03-08 18:00:31	elly	and tbf I usually *do* have a purse with my phone in it
2022-03-08 18:00:32	elly	but still
2022-03-08 18:00:39	dzwdz	that dress + cargo pants
2022-03-08 18:00:41	dzwdz	storage heaven
2022-03-08 18:01:15	juspib	my new phone is a wide boy
2022-03-08 18:01:16	dzwdz	a cargo jacket too because at this point, why limit yourself
2022-03-08 18:02:06	juspib	cant really fit it in my pants pockets but it's amazing for reading
2022-03-08 18:02:22	elly	I am so happy with my kobo libra for reading
2022-03-08 18:02:28	elly	I have started carrying it with me everywhere
2022-03-08 18:02:59	dzwdz	i left my kindle over at my grandparents' and haven't had access to it for something like 10 days now :(
2022-03-08 18:03:12	dzwdz	the kobos do seem cool
2022-03-08 18:03:41	dzwdz	do they handle the web well?
2022-03-08 18:04:20	elly	I don't know tbh, I put epubs on it
2022-03-08 18:04:38	dzwdz	oh righttt, you don't have to bother with converting them to mobi either
2022-03-08 18:04:45	elly	I use it as a USB mass storage device that displays epubs
2022-03-08 18:04:56	extratone	regarding reading on my 4S - https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/4sreading.JPG
2022-03-08 18:04:59	elly	I don't think it actually has the house wifi configured even
2022-03-08 18:06:09	josh	\o.//oo\\o/
2022-03-08 18:06:21	dzwdz	/o\o/
2022-03-08 18:06:42	josh	' drop table waves;-- o/
2022-03-08 18:08:16	juspib	/oooo/
2022-03-08 18:08:27	josh	you ever plug in an old drive and waste a bunch of time looking through the dumb shit you used to do
2022-03-08 18:08:36	josh	this is why i never store any data
2022-03-08 18:09:12	elly	I have done that! but I don't think it is a waste really
2022-03-08 18:09:25	elly	it's kind of cool to see how you have changed over time ime
2022-03-08 18:09:27	josh	it's kinda fun to reminisce
2022-03-08 18:09:29	dzwdz	^
2022-03-08 18:09:52	extratone	having lost all of my drives once... all that ends up happening is I waste time trying to recover stuff from other sources.
2022-03-08 18:10:12	extratone	but I can suppose it would have been healthy for another type of human.
2022-03-08 18:10:28	dzwdz	oh no, i hope your other stuff was okay
2022-03-08 18:10:29	josh	then you throw all that shit in a folder called "old" and copy over whatever you're backing up this time not to be seen ever again until next time you do this again and repeat the cycle
2022-03-08 18:10:30	elly	yeah, I erased ~all my data back in 2011 so I have nothing from before then and I feel fine about that
2022-03-08 18:10:35	elly	josh: lol, yes
2022-03-08 18:10:39	elly	~/old/old/old gang
2022-03-08 18:10:45	josh	hell yeah lol
2022-03-08 18:11:20	dzwdz	if you do that then it just means that you don't organise your data well enough
2022-03-08 18:11:34	elly	counterpoint: I organize it exactly well enough
2022-03-08 18:11:44	elly	spending more time organizing it further would be wasted
2022-03-08 18:11:56	josh	ln -s ~/old ~/old/old/old/old
2022-03-08 18:12:46	josh	i organize my new stuff as much as is reasonable
2022-03-08 18:12:52	josh	but old stuff goes onto the pile
2022-03-08 18:13:13	extratone	no I lost everything. all my photo/video/audio equipment plus three external drives and two computers. (someone promised to pay a storage unit bill and didn't.)
2022-03-08 18:13:16	elly	I have a theory about this, which is that organizing data has exactly the same satisficer/maximizer split as most other aspects of psychology
2022-03-08 18:13:17	josh	until the drive fails or i do something stupid and blow it all away
2022-03-08 18:13:36	josh	ouch that sucks extratone
2022-03-08 18:13:37	elly	and so people tend to either have an organization scheme that is "just barely good enough" (like me) or people tend to have one that they work on and improve constantly
2022-03-08 18:13:40	elly	extratone: ow
2022-03-08 18:13:56	extratone	it's not the worst thing that's happened to me but it was pretty close. I appreciate the sympathy.
2022-03-08 18:14:08	extratone	I miss my mics the most tbh.
2022-03-08 18:15:01	extratone	I wasn't upset that they didn't pay - just that they didn't TELL me they weren't going to.
2022-03-08 18:15:11	josh	yeah, i'd be pretty damn annoyed thbh
2022-03-08 18:15:42	extratone	it was an alcoholic ex mother in law whom I should have never trusted, so.
2022-03-08 18:16:10	josh	:/
2022-03-08 18:16:12	extratone	god I am so tired of listening to apple executives use adjectives.
2022-03-08 18:16:14	josh	that sounds rough
2022-03-08 18:16:22	josh	ban adjectives
2022-03-08 18:16:28	elly	apple presenter noun and verb only challenge
2022-03-08 18:16:29	extratone	I was just thinking that.
2022-03-08 18:16:42	elly	We are shipping a phone. It will be available in November.
2022-03-08 18:16:50	dzwdz	sounds like a wm
2022-03-08 18:16:50	m455	good technical writing right there
2022-03-08 18:17:00	elly	m455: ha yes
2022-03-08 18:17:05	dzwdz	fuck, writing on my phone is awful
2022-03-08 18:17:20	dzwdz	that sounds like an idea for a quirk channel
2022-03-08 18:17:29	dzwdz	nouns and verbs only
2022-03-08 18:17:32	extratone	dzwdz that's my thing you know. are you using an external keyboard?
2022-03-08 18:17:37	josh	is "my" an adjective?
2022-03-08 18:17:53	elly	I don't think so
2022-03-08 18:18:02	josh	it operates like one
2022-03-08 18:18:06	elly	I'm actually not sure what part of speech that is
2022-03-08 18:18:13	dzwdz	i'm using an osk on a screen that is half dead
2022-03-08 18:18:19	elly	apparently it's a "determiner"
2022-03-08 18:18:22	elly	thanks, OED
2022-03-08 18:18:22	josh	"possessive adjective"
2022-03-08 18:18:35	elly	"possessive pronoun" too, apparently
2022-03-08 18:18:35	dzwdz	i have to move the keyboard around to get to certain letters
2022-03-08 18:18:43	extratone	oh jesus.
2022-03-08 18:19:16	josh	you need a new whatever device you're using
2022-03-08 18:20:06	dzwdz	naw
2022-03-08 18:20:10	dzwdz	i like this phone
2022-03-08 18:20:23	dzwdz	i should just go to a repair shop but i can't be bothered to
2022-03-08 18:20:25	josh	what kinda phone you got
2022-03-08 18:20:40	dzwdz	xiaomi mi a2 lite
2022-03-08 18:20:58	dzwdz	i also have a phone gifted from a friend (huawei p10 lite iirc) that i have with me too
2022-03-08 18:21:13	dzwdz	but i don't trust it with basically any of my accounts so it's literally just a device for playing chess
2022-03-08 18:21:22	josh	man look at mr money bags with two phones
2022-03-08 18:21:34	josh	eat the rich

2022-03-08 18:22:20	josh	what happened
2022-03-08 18:22:54	dzwdz	i'm too lazy to look for the security advisory
2022-03-08 18:22:59	dzwdz	but there are two critical use-after-frees
2022-03-08 18:23:11	insom	hey fam. lol hexchat showed I had a mention but it was hundreds of lines ago, UX could be better here!
2022-03-08 18:23:18	dzwdz	which makes it the second day in a row where a critical vuln in some popular software is discovered
2022-03-08 18:23:36	dzwdz	what are your bets for tommorow's vuln
2022-03-08 18:23:44	josh	google hacked
2022-03-08 18:23:45	elly	it's been a while for Windows
2022-03-08 18:23:52	elly	josh: *that* would be quite noteworthy
2022-03-08 18:24:21	dzwdz	eh, i don't think it'll be windows yet
2022-03-08 18:24:23	dzwdz	maybe day 6/7
2022-03-08 18:24:51	josh	RCE in ping
2022-03-08 18:25:07	elly	that would also be quite noteworthy
2022-03-08 18:25:21	josh	gcc has been a trojan all this time and no one's realized
2022-03-08 18:25:29	dzwdz	rce in package managers
2022-03-08 18:25:36	elly	josh: Trusting Trust vibes
2022-03-08 18:25:45	josh	rce in browsers but only in a sandbox
2022-03-08 18:25:55	elly	RCE in the renderer would not be newsworthy
2022-03-08 18:25:59	dzwdz	rce in aws
2022-03-08 18:26:07	elly	AWS would be a pretty exciting one
2022-03-08 18:26:16	josh	turns out computers will just run whatever you tell them
2022-03-08 18:26:19	dzwdz	i was just referring to sshing into a vps you own
2022-03-08 18:26:25	dzwdz	and running code there
2022-03-08 18:26:53	elly	that could be quite a fun parody video
2022-03-08 18:26:59	josh	QEMU is totally and utterly broken
2022-03-08 18:27:03	elly	AWS COMPLETELY HACKED ARBITRARY CODE EXEC UNPATCHED FOR YEARS
2022-03-08 18:27:10	elly	video of you provisioning an instance and sshing in
2022-03-08 18:27:31	dzwdz	how 2 gain rce on aws
2022-03-08 18:27:38	josh	in fact, tomorrow, someone will prove that sandboxing is mathematically impossible
2022-03-08 18:27:45	elly	oh fuck oh god
2022-03-08 18:27:47	juspib	dzwdz we xiaomi bros
2022-03-08 18:27:56	elly	josh: researchers are always proving stuff like that, is the thing
2022-03-08 18:27:59	dzwdz	(set to 009 sound system)
2022-03-08 18:28:05	elly	nobody cares all that much though
2022-03-08 18:28:14	josh	yeah i don't think that would be all that note worthy
2022-03-08 18:28:21	elly	they're like "no matter what you do if you can get a cpu to do 7 multiply instructions in a row you get root" and people kinda shrug and are like "oh well"
2022-03-08 18:28:22	josh	i mean obviously it would be kinda
2022-03-08 18:28:25	elly	"I guess that's how life is"
2022-03-08 18:28:46	elly	we just accept that we live in a world where a teenager with a pringles and a software radio could, if they wanted to, probably steal your credit card
2022-03-08 18:28:49	josh	OSes just role out a patch to run a nop every 7 instructions
2022-03-08 18:28:52	dzwdz	i use a handmade ben eater-style cpu for extra security
2022-03-08 18:29:01	elly	josh: yeah literally
2022-03-08 18:29:09	elly	until the intel firmware patch arrives to do the same thing
2022-03-08 18:29:18	josh	yep
2022-03-08 18:29:23	dzwdz	but then people won't run it because it isn't free software
2022-03-08 18:29:29	josh	something that surprised me
2022-03-08 18:29:41	josh	i really expected when the whole ukraine thing began
2022-03-08 18:29:44	juspib	dzwdz i laugh at your hand made cpu
2022-03-08 18:29:50	josh	that literally everything was about to be hacked (in ukraine)
2022-03-08 18:29:52	juspib	i print my chips in a handmade fab
2022-03-08 18:29:59	josh	so maybe we aren't as fucked as i thought we were
2022-03-08 18:30:11	dzwdz	why do you think they'd announce that
2022-03-08 18:30:27	dzwdz	what, would russia just deface their sites or something
2022-03-08 18:30:39	josh	i had always assumed everything was already pwned and the first thing that would happen in a major war would be that critical infrastructure would go completely dark
2022-03-08 18:30:49	josh	no i'm talking like power plants and shit
2022-03-08 18:31:27	dzwdz	well this isn't /that/ major yet
2022-03-08 18:31:34	josh	yeah true
2022-03-08 18:31:43	josh	maybe they could and just don't want people to know they have the capability
2022-03-08 18:32:26	dzwdz	i wonder if anyone has compiled gpg for cardiac yet
2022-03-08 18:32:54	josh	like running on a heart?
2022-03-08 18:33:02	dzwdz	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARDboard_Illustrative_Aid_to_Computation
2022-03-08 18:33:53	josh	that's neat
2022-03-08 18:35:03	elly	that is a cool device
2022-03-08 18:36:01	elly	hm, approximately 1000 bits of memory, though
2022-03-08 18:36:07	elly	that might not be enough
2022-03-08 18:36:28	josh	they should've made it a lisp machine
2022-03-08 18:36:33	dzwdz	yeah you need to network multiple of them together
2022-03-08 18:37:15	elly	distributed bigint computation running on physical computers :o
2022-03-08 18:37:39	josh	networking is just the operators shouting numbers at each other
2022-03-08 18:37:59	josh	it's wireless, even
2022-03-08 18:40:36	josh	just need two new insturctions, YEL and EAR
2022-03-08 18:40:43	juspib	folding@cardiac
2022-03-08 18:40:58	dzwdz	see it's literally foldable
2022-03-08 18:41:01	dzwdz	it's cardboard

2022-03-08 18:41:29	tomasino	hmm, did that bot go away?
2022-03-08 18:41:34	dzwdz	we had a restart
2022-03-08 18:41:37	tomasino	ahh
2022-03-08 18:41:44	tomasino	well, it's fun!
2022-03-08 18:46:29	@natalia	hmmmm, having trouble finding good lua resources for beginners
2022-03-08 18:46:44	@natalia	i think i am going to have to like, find a bunch of cool resources from better guides for other languages and then adapt them
2022-03-08 18:48:59	tomasino	exercism.io stuff+
2022-03-08 18:49:02	tomasino	?
2022-03-08 18:50:30	@natalia	i am looking at sicp and htdp right now to see if there is much i can teach about designing programs
2022-03-08 18:51:48	extratone	is there a high-value method of converting my wired keyboard’s input to Bluetooth that my iPhone will understand?
2022-03-08 18:52:05	@vilmibm	high low
2022-03-08 18:53:11	tomasino	raspberry pi project!
2022-03-08 19:05:19	dzwdz	do we happen to have a #queer channel or something?
2022-03-08 19:11:31	@natalia	i think we used to; i haven't been in it for a long time because i think it was inactive
2022-03-08 19:11:51	@natalia	i prefer to just talk about queer things here myself
2022-03-08 19:13:17	dzwdz	was it a general channel or was it #gender?
2022-03-08 19:13:19	dzwdz	also like
2022-03-08 19:14:48	dzwdz	if you ask about queer stuff here you can't use "y'all" to refer to the others
2022-03-08 19:19:22	@natalia	sure you can just say: "queer people: ..."
2022-03-08 19:19:31	@natalia	but no it was named #queer
2022-03-08 19:19:41	@natalia	i think it had the fate of many channels via many server restarts

2022-03-08 20:34:09	dzwdz	oh hey, that didn't ping me
2022-03-08 20:34:11	dzwdz	huh
2022-03-08 20:34:13	@vilmibm	commuting is not great
2022-03-08 20:34:24	caff	extratone: Yeah, haha. It's been running for years.
2022-03-08 20:34:38	caff	dzwdz: There's an invisible character inserted into names to keep it from pinging people :)
2022-03-08 20:34:43	dzwdz	ooo, smart
2022-03-08 20:34:49	extratone	I would have used it but I don't think anybody would like my songs of the days.
2022-03-08 20:35:06	dzwdz	that's even better
2022-03-08 20:35:30	caff	All the more reason to set those songs :) Discovery is the best way to find new music. My music's been an extremely eclectic mix over the year.
2022-03-08 20:35:34	caff	Err, years.
2022-03-08 20:36:35	caff	I still have aspirations of making a SOTD data explorer page at some point. severak's SOTDbot DJ page was also super neat :)
2022-03-08 20:36:49	dzwdz	wait, i thought that was what sotd was made for
2022-03-08 20:37:35	caff	Made for what?
2022-03-08 20:37:46	dzwdz	the dj page
2022-03-08 20:38:23	extratone	alright I'll start off with something mild. !sotd https://youtube.com/watch?v=jky5-kKbY98

2022-03-08 20:39:51	extratone	Nasenbluten as an infant.
2022-03-08 20:40:38	caff	Never heard them before, but this is dope :)
2022-03-08 20:40:49	caff	Honestly, sotdbot has helped me grow my musical tastes a ton.
2022-03-08 20:41:35	extratone	if there was one request I'd have for it, caff, it'd be integration with Odesli (song.link)
2022-03-08 20:42:00	caff	That's been on my todo list for a while, haha. Sadly I haven't really built any new features for SOTDbot in the past year or two.
2022-03-08 20:42:08	caff	Just kept it from breaking (usually, sometimes)
2022-03-08 20:42:30	extratone	lol well I'm not complaining. I just try to advocate for Odesli at every opportunity.
2022-03-08 20:42:41	caff	I need to go through and test the integrations I built again, but at least at some point it was working with Soundcloud, Archive.org, and a couple others.
2022-03-08 20:42:58	caff	Oh yeah. It's super nice to have a streaming-service agnostic music link :D
2022-03-08 20:43:42	extratone	Blinded by the light \ revved up like a deuce \ another roller in the night has always sounded like the experience of birth to me. 
2022-03-08 20:44:01	caff	I need to go back and look and see if I actually ever applied for a Odesli API key.
2022-03-08 20:44:47	extratone	I was about to give you mine but apparently I didn't put it in my password manager :/
2022-03-08 20:45:09	extratone	I'm a paying customer for artist pages for my friends so.
2022-03-08 20:45:26	caff	Oh nice! Yeah, all my experiences with Odesli so far have been overwhlemingly positive.
2022-03-08 20:46:23	extratone	oh no... the dev docs are on Notion.
2022-03-08 20:46:35	caff	Yeaaah. But it's at least well written.
2022-03-08 20:49:26	caff	Oh, and dzwdz, nope. Just something that severak made after I made the bot. :)
2022-03-08 20:49:42	caff	But yeah, if anyone does want to play with the data, it's located at ~caff/code/sotdbot/sotd.db

2022-03-08 21:28:05	nihilazo	a lil bit and it kinda sucked. I think I only like really light beers lol
2022-03-08 21:28:12	dzwdz	beer's overrated
2022-03-08 21:28:17	nihilazo	kvass is the shit
2022-03-08 21:28:53	nihilazo	it's like the bits of beer I like but also kinda like lemonade. It's good shit. And I can make it at home
2022-03-08 21:29:01	dzwdz	i've never had it tbh
2022-03-08 21:29:12	extratone	I mentioned this when I first came in this IRC a few weeks ago but I created a Raindrop collection of all Tilde sites as my “gift” to the tildeverse. https://raindrop.io/davidblue/tilde-22520136
2022-03-08 21:29:40	dzwdz	i have a good excuse against peer pressure so
2022-03-08 21:30:03	dzwdz	i've also heard enough stories from my friends who do drink, lel
2022-03-08 21:30:56	nihilazo	TIL the version of moonshell I was running was an unstable version specifically made for use with an expansion board. oops
2022-03-08 21:31:04	nihilazo	time to try the stable moonshell 2.10
2022-03-08 21:31:08	dzwdz	speaking of versions
2022-03-08 21:31:12	dzwdz	update firefox and thunderbird
2022-03-08 21:31:14	nihilazo	see if it's better as a DS music player to try

2022-03-08 21:35:58	twee	also i recommend going to a decent beer place and trying a bunch (cough brew york), there's a whole lot of variety
2022-03-08 21:36:52	twee	extratone: wow that's a lot of sites
2022-03-08 21:37:20	extratone	elly, if you’re still here, what was that web-based outlining tool you shared recently? or am I thinking of someone else?
2022-03-08 21:37:47	extratone	the funny thing is that I don't even remember how I (created that collection.)
2022-03-08 21:40:24	nihilazo	twee: https://tilde.town/~nihilazo/recipes/kvass.html
2022-03-08 21:40:38	nihilazo	also yeah I do want to try a bunch of different beers. I think I could find one I really like
2022-03-08 21:40:56	nihilazo	because there's parts of beers I've tried (a few different IPAs) that I really like and parts I really don't
2022-03-08 21:41:44	twee	cant say im an ipa fan tbh
2022-03-08 21:42:14	twee	i go through phases of what i want to drink
2022-03-08 21:45:23	extratone	just ls on your recipes directory nihilazo.. that's a lot lol

2022-03-08 21:50:27	nihilazo	extratone: I collect them and share them as I make them
2022-03-08 21:51:04	extratone	no I'm sorry for bothering you hehe. I just have a friend who's asking me about web-based text editing services specifically for outlining.
2022-03-08 21:51:41	elly	nah I use vi
2022-03-08 21:53:27	extratone	powerful. :O
2022-03-08 21:55:59	petra	web-vi would be a concept and a half
2022-03-08 21:56:03	petra	viw
2022-03-08 22:03:18	twee	wi
2022-03-08 22:06:55	nihilazo	I once used a web port of vim but it sucked
2022-03-08 22:06:59	nihilazo	(even more than normal vim)
2022-03-08 22:07:03	extratone	yes, I think I should suggest building that from scratch lol
2022-03-08 22:07:04	nihilazo	(like, it sucked as a port)

2022-03-09 07:48:20	nihilazo	there are patches that people sell to put on service dog harnesses that say things like "ask to pet" and I kinda want to put an "ask to pet" patch on my patch jacket becuase I think it's funny
2022-03-09 07:48:27	nihilazo	but idk what degree to which that is hella furry cringe
2022-03-09 07:50:49	dzwdz	lmaooooo
2022-03-09 07:50:51	dzwdz	do it
2022-03-09 07:51:06	dzwdz	god that's fucking magnificent
2022-03-09 07:53:14	nihilazo	I actually got the idea from the dorian electra x left hand collab, which has some similarly furry shit
2022-03-09 07:53:17	nihilazo	I think that dorian is a furry
2022-03-09 07:53:35	nihilazo	or at least embracing furry imagery to some degree
2022-03-09 07:54:01	dzwdz	i don't think so
2022-03-09 07:54:15	dzwdz	unless by dorian you mean dzwdz
2022-03-09 07:56:12	nihilazo	by dorian I mean dorian electra. I mean they did some really quite furry photoshoots and there's some furry-ish stuff in the left hand collab thing
2022-03-09 07:56:39	nihilazo	altho it may just be part of the "weird internet shit" ideas around my agenda. who knows, whatever
2022-03-09 07:56:46	nihilazo	dzwdz: finally coming out as a furry? :P
2022-03-09 07:58:55	juspib	does ios allow the user to have two instances of the same program running?
2022-03-09 07:59:21	juspib	cuz i just realized android doesn't so it's not a proper multitasking os
2022-03-09 08:09:33	extratone	juspib iOS does not, as far as I know, but I think iPadOS does.
2022-03-09 08:12:59	nihilazo	funny thing with me calling myself a furry is that I'm probably technically not a furry by some definitions bc I don't have a fursona and don't really like fursuit heads (I think they can be kinda weird looking most of the time)
2022-03-09 08:13:04	nihilazo	but idk, it's a vibe
2022-03-09 08:13:07	nihilazo	furry is a vibe
2022-03-09 08:14:40	nihilazo	dunno why town is the place I'm talking about this? I guess bc it's the most supportive community I'm in
2022-03-09 08:17:20	extratone	well I hear you. I don't think a fursona is an absolute requisite, but I don't know much.
2022-03-09 08:21:30	nihilazo	I guess I'm kinda making a fursona rn lol or at least coming up with ideas for one

2022-03-09 09:39:58	juspib	are they just txt with formatting?
2022-03-09 09:40:26	twee	basically
2022-03-09 09:40:35	twee	it's a zipped set of xml files
2022-03-09 09:40:54	twee	the one that shocks me is djvu
2022-03-09 09:40:57	twee	how are they so small
2022-03-09 09:42:32	nihilazo	epub is html in a zip right
2022-03-09 09:42:33	nihilazo	basically
2022-03-09 09:42:37	nihilazo	slightly different
2022-03-09 09:43:12	extratone	my question is - how on earth is PDF still the professional/academic standard.
2022-03-09 09:44:12	extratone	Adobe’s own PDF reader is called Acrobat... as if advanced acrobatics are required to read its damned text files lol.
2022-03-09 09:46:06	juspib	"no one wants to rewrite TeX" is the reason
2022-03-09 09:50:21	twee	swear pdf isn't even the default output for tex
2022-03-09 09:50:27	twee	make postscript the standard
2022-03-09 09:50:53	twee	then again, i'm so much happier with (most) pdfs i receive than when i receive a .docx, or even worse a .doc file
2022-03-09 09:51:05	nihilazo	doesn't tex outfput .dvi by default
2022-03-09 09:51:08	nihilazo	or something like that
2022-03-09 09:51:19	nihilazo	everybody uses pdftex because it kinda sorta works
2022-03-09 09:51:25	twee	yeah
2022-03-09 09:51:29	twee	and people like .pdf enough
2022-03-09 09:51:29	nihilazo	(as much as TeX ever really works, I'm not a fan of it)
2022-03-09 09:51:36	twee	tbh now that browsers open pdfs its decent
2022-03-09 09:51:42	nihilazo	I like .pdf a lot more than I like anything else that people send me
2022-03-09 09:51:46	nihilazo	you send me a .docx I hate you
2022-03-09 09:51:53	twee	i dont agree with it philosophically, but firefox and chromes readers are way better than acrobat for everyday use
2022-03-09 09:51:58	nihilazo	you send me a .doc then I assume you are 80 years old and don't know what you're doing
2022-03-09 09:52:05	nihilazo	you send me a PDF I can actually read your document
2022-03-09 09:52:12	nihilazo	and that's better than .doc[x]

2022-03-09 09:53:13	nihilazo	lol
2022-03-09 09:53:16	twee	if i become a professor, i'll be 100% making sure that all my readings are available as, i dont know, markdown and compiled pdf
2022-03-09 09:53:52	nihilazo	same, I'd make sure that my stuff was available in like, pdf, markdown (or some other plaintext format), and basic html (because everybody has a basic html viewer)
2022-03-09 09:54:11	nihilazo	(well, everybody with a modern device that will view digital documents)
2022-03-09 09:54:26	twee	yeah
2022-03-09 09:54:32	nihilazo	I'm not a fan of LaTeX and I've been looking for something better for ages

2022-03-09 09:55:01	juspib	i don't get why gif is at the bottom
2022-03-09 09:55:19	twee	some time last year i wrote a gemtext to ms roff parser
2022-03-09 09:55:20	twee	it was shit
2022-03-09 09:56:45	nihilazo	sile is interesting
2022-03-09 09:57:00	nihilazo	I might check it out when I next need to make documents
2022-03-09 09:57:19	nihilazo	I feel like document processing/slideshow tools are the tools that I get obsessed over finding good ones, even tho I rarely ever need them
2022-03-09 09:58:06	nihilazo	"The standard-fish function takes a height, width, direction symbol, color string, eye-color string, and boolean to indicate whether the fish’s mouth is open"
2022-03-09 09:58:09	nihilazo	I love racket docs
2022-03-09 09:59:09	twee	that's so cool
2022-03-09 09:59:13	twee	oh yeah theres pollen
2022-03-09 09:59:23	nihilazo	pollen?

2022-03-09 10:00:17	nihilazo	there is actually stdlib functions for drawing fish.
2022-03-09 10:01:13	twee	https://github.com/gfngfn/SATySFi also found this
2022-03-09 10:01:26	twee	pollen is the racket-based typesetting system used by the beautiful racket guy
2022-03-09 10:01:36	twee	who i don't like much i don't think
2022-03-09 10:02:07	nihilazo	in racket-land there's also scribble
2022-03-09 10:02:16	nihilazo	but I think that's more just a doc tool
2022-03-09 10:03:51	twee	ahh, i was trying to find scribble when i remembered pollen
2022-03-09 10:03:54	 *	nihilazo is going through HTDP rn
2022-03-09 10:04:00	twee	i did half my epq with scribble
2022-03-09 10:04:04	nihilazo	o nice
2022-03-09 10:04:04	twee	and then moved to word
2022-03-09 10:04:09	nihilazo	I gave up on my epq
2022-03-09 10:04:25	nihilazo	it got too much doing 2nd year A-level and epq at the same time
2022-03-09 10:04:26	twee	wait no, i did it in latex in the end
2022-03-09 10:04:29	twee	yeah that's fair
2022-03-09 10:04:46	nihilazo	so far my take on racket is "you can draw pictures in the repl and that's really cool"
2022-03-09 10:04:50	juspib	do you have land?
2022-03-09 10:04:54	nihilazo	but it's a whole world i am very interested in exploring more
2022-03-09 10:05:02	nihilazo	the racket world
2022-03-09 10:05:14	twee	yo the times in times new roman is the times newspaper
2022-03-09 10:05:16	nihilazo	once I finish htdp I might explore it more for things other than just doing htdp
2022-03-09 10:05:17	twee	how did i only just now that
2022-03-09 10:05:27	nihilazo	it's also the best font 4 kids

2022-03-09 10:10:20	juspib	all my brothers and even one of my sisters have land
2022-03-09 10:10:41	nihilazo	I tried roff/troff once
2022-03-09 10:10:47	nihilazo	the output is OK
2022-03-09 10:10:52	nihilazo	the syntax is awful
2022-03-09 10:11:00	twee	yes
2022-03-09 10:11:04	nihilazo	and using it with pandoc is far more painful than using TeX with pandoc, so that's what I'm currently doing
2022-03-09 10:11:07	nihilazo	but I don't like it
2022-03-09 10:11:18	nihilazo	because it doesn't give me the control I want over how things look
2022-03-09 10:11:19	twee	writing a simple overlay isn't too hard
2022-03-09 10:11:42	nihilazo	without doing hacky workarounds or lacing my markdown with \formatting[nonsense]{from stackoverflow} co
2022-03-09 10:11:47	nihilazo	s/ co //
2022-03-09 10:12:52	nihilazo	for all its problems, it is easy to change how a word document is visually
2022-03-09 10:12:57	nihilazo	which I've found hard with TeX
2022-03-09 10:13:22	nihilazo	LaTeX looks like LaTeX and I don't want it to, and don't want to learn a bunch of .sty stuff to change that
2022-03-09 10:13:47	twee	i personally like the latex look
2022-03-09 10:13:50	twee	except the massive margins
2022-03-09 10:16:10	twee	all i want from a typesetter, as a humanities student, is a couple of levels of headings, bullets and numbered lists, paragraphs, horizontal rules,,, not sure what else
2022-03-09 10:16:28	twee	simple syntax, utf-8 first (probably), and standard fonts
2022-03-09 10:17:09	twee	i wouldn't even mind if it compiled to jpg if i could easily print it out
2022-03-09 10:20:56	juspib	tex compiler to rtf

2022-03-09 10:24:25	nihilazo	rtf is an interesting format to me
2022-03-09 10:24:51	nihilazo	but it's one of those annoying formats with no real specification
2022-03-09 10:25:45	twee	well it has a spec, just microsoft won't share it
2022-03-09 10:25:54	twee	i like that it's just plain text
2022-03-09 10:26:46	twee	to be honest i feel like there's a lot to be said for a html format
2022-03-09 10:26:49	twee	like, it's not the worst
2022-03-09 10:26:58	twee	there are a bunch of quality of life stuff missing though
2022-03-09 10:27:51	extratone	I was under the impression most of y'all command line-living folks were plaintext/markdown only. guess I was wrong.
2022-03-09 10:28:07	twee	i use plain text a fair amount
2022-03-09 10:28:20	twee	markdown is kind of ugly to me, i don't like the inline formatting choices
2022-03-09 10:28:26	twee	and it's vaguely defined
2022-03-09 10:28:53	twee	i'm not really a command line living folk though
2022-03-09 10:29:22	 *	twee writes all their notes in png
2022-03-09 10:30:03	 *	nihilazo is not a command line person either
2022-03-09 10:30:57	extratone	sorry :/ that came across as quite discriminitory but it was meant as a label of respect.
2022-03-09 10:31:30	extratone	multimarkdown is a lot more tightly defined, no?
2022-03-09 10:32:13	twee	not a clue
2022-03-09 10:32:17	extratone	I agree that it can look messy. especially with asterisk unordered lists instead of hypenated unordered lists.
2022-03-09 10:32:34	nihilazo	I don't hate markdown as a format, other than that every program processes it slightly differently
2022-03-09 10:32:44	nihilazo	it's a markup dialect family rather than a markup language
2022-03-09 10:32:45	juspib	i am a cli+browser person
2022-03-09 10:32:54	nihilazo	I am an ex-cli person
2022-03-09 10:33:01	twee	ooh interestingly multimarkdown's compiler supports odt
2022-03-09 10:33:17	extratone	really. I didn't know that.
2022-03-09 10:33:47	twee	i can't find easy access to a spec on their site :/
2022-03-09 10:34:07	twee	ah found one
2022-03-09 10:34:27	twee	but like, **bold** __bold__ *italic* _italic_ what?
2022-03-09 10:34:41	twee	i like how org does those things most
2022-03-09 10:35:44	tomasino	the markdown text markup never really jived in my brain. been writing in plain text too long and *this* was bold
2022-03-09 10:35:58	extratone	well I've been wanting to write a more specific variation of markdown for drafts but developing syntaxes involves an understanding of regex that I do not have.
2022-03-09 10:38:07	extratone	extradown does have a good ring to it lol
2022-03-09 10:39:54	 *	nihilazo is considering making new css for his site
2022-03-09 10:41:24	juspib	tilde.town site?
2022-03-09 10:41:45	nihilazo	yeah
2022-03-09 10:41:59	juspib	yea do that
2022-03-09 10:42:03	juspib	it looks bad
2022-03-09 10:42:10	juspib	at least on mobile
2022-03-09 10:42:51	nihilazo	time to get my base stylesheet, which is bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com
2022-03-09 10:42:58	nihilazo	then work from there
2022-03-09 10:43:23	juspib	that's good for useful sites
2022-03-09 10:43:30	juspib	personal sites are meant to be fancy
2022-03-09 10:44:02	nihilazo	yeah but it's a base for me adding fanciness
2022-03-09 10:51:52	juspib	my fren from finland doesn't text me back anymore
2022-03-09 10:52:28	juspib	and i keep my discord account mostly to chat with him so i might go free soon
2022-03-09 10:54:55	twee	yeah it's *bold* /italic/ _underline_
2022-03-09 10:55:40	twee	i like simple personal sites
2022-03-09 10:55:53	tomasino	samesies
2022-03-09 10:55:59	tomasino	i'm quite proud of tomasino.org
2022-03-09 10:57:56	nihilazo	https://ttm.sh/iJa.png
2022-03-09 10:57:58	nihilazo	boring so far
2022-03-09 10:58:00	nihilazo	but readable
2022-03-09 10:59:55	juspib	not really readable
2022-03-09 11:00:07	juspib	proprietary language
2022-03-09 11:00:18	nihilazo	toki pona?
2022-03-09 11:00:31	nihilazo	it's in english too
2022-03-09 11:00:45	nihilazo	everything in toki pona is just a translation of the english
2022-03-09 11:01:43	tomasino	rock on. do as you like, as all personal sites should
2022-03-09 11:01:45	tomasino	break some rules
2022-03-09 11:03:14	extratone	tomasino, this is very cool (site.)
2022-03-09 11:03:56	twee	i like it
2022-03-09 11:04:26	twee	proprietary language is a bit of a stretch
2022-03-09 11:04:41	twee	tomasino: im liking your last.fm, medium compatibility
2022-03-09 11:05:02	juspib	https://juspib.ducklog.com/ this is the peak of web design
2022-03-09 11:05:12	twee	je suis disagree
2022-03-09 11:05:32	twee	i quite like yours nico
2022-03-09 11:05:46	extratone	tilde.news looks cool.
2022-03-09 11:06:00	tomasino	:)
2022-03-09 11:06:07	tomasino	i just updated tomasino.org to add some "bold"
2022-03-09 11:06:28	extratone	agreed juspib
2022-03-09 11:07:10	twee	https://ttm.sh/iJO.png
2022-03-09 11:07:11	tomasino	juspib, excellent content
2022-03-09 11:07:21	twee	tilde.news is decent
2022-03-09 11:08:34	twee	i like copy.sh
2022-03-09 11:08:34	extratone	y’all wanna see the peak of web design alright. https://iowa.neocities.org
2022-03-09 11:09:04	extratone	don't explore too far though there's some embarrasingly insensitive language somewhere.
2022-03-09 11:13:25	nihilazo	is it too tacky to make links on my website do animated rainbows when hovered over
2022-03-09 11:13:32	juspib	no
2022-03-09 11:14:10	nihilazo	the other thing I'm thinking is making sure my site remains accessible with old browsers, screen readers etc
2022-03-09 11:14:18	nihilazo	but it's perfectly accessible without any css at all
2022-03-09 11:14:21	nihilazo	so any css is just flair
2022-03-09 11:15:48	twee	no
2022-03-09 11:15:56	twee	add rainbows
2022-03-09 11:16:27	twee	this is one of my favourite personal sites http://motsuka.com/
2022-03-09 11:16:29	extratone	cursor trail!!
2022-03-09 11:16:34	twee	or digital business cards i guess
2022-03-09 11:16:39	twee	but i really like the rainbow effect
2022-03-09 11:16:48	twee	doesn't feel tacky
2022-03-09 11:16:58	twee	(also she's the one who did the solar low tech magazine site)
2022-03-09 11:17:12	tomasino	for mine i wanted to make sure it works perfectly for text browsers and screen readers, but for sighted users with css it emulates the look of a markdown document. I'm also doing prefers-color-scheme work to add in two color schemes that are easy on the eyes. It's fun!
2022-03-09 11:19:35	nihilazo	how do I do fonts on the web in a way that doesn't suck
2022-03-09 11:19:50	nihilazo	also, any fonts with an open licence with a vibe like comic sans but not ugly? Like a kinda playful vibe but still readable
2022-03-09 11:20:47	twee	there's comic neue
2022-03-09 11:20:55	twee	http://www.comicneue.com/
2022-03-09 11:21:18	nihilazo	it's PERFECT
2022-03-09 11:21:28	nihilazo	ty
2022-03-09 11:21:54	nihilazo	should I use google fonts or host the fonts myself
2022-03-09 11:21:58	twee	host
2022-03-09 11:22:00	nihilazo	don't want to be relying on a google thing
2022-03-09 11:22:13	twee	yeah
2022-03-09 11:22:25	twee	i cant remember how to set up web fonts though
2022-03-09 11:22:29	nihilazo	k
2022-03-09 11:22:39	twee	i just use font: 16pt/1.4 "Times New Roman", serif; lol
2022-03-09 11:24:19	nihilazo	I like writing css
2022-03-09 11:24:27	nihilazo	for things like this
2022-03-09 11:24:34	nihilazo	for apps it's pain, but for simple websites it's fun
2022-03-09 11:24:40	tomasino	you can use google fonts, but download them and self-host
2022-03-09 11:24:45	tomasino	free, but without the tracking
2022-03-09 11:25:44	tomasino	if you take a font you like and upload it to fontsquirrel and  generate woff and woff2 versions, it'll spit out sample CSS with it showing you how to use them
2022-03-09 11:26:17	twee	swear you can download woffs from google fonts these days
2022-03-09 11:27:32	extratone	http://badnoise.net/TypeRip/
2022-03-09 11:28:56	nihilazo	alright, I'm going to college
2022-03-09 11:28:57	tomasino	there's ways, but if you need the css help...
2022-03-09 11:28:58	nihilazo	see everybody later
2022-03-09 11:29:02	tomasino	ciao
2022-03-09 11:29:05	nihilazo	I just got some woff files and I'm using those
2022-03-09 11:29:14	nihilazo	I need to do better colors but then I think new stylesheet v0.1 is done
2022-03-09 11:29:34	nihilazo	it's like a very basic site, but with some cute touches (like rainbow link hover and fonts)
2022-03-09 11:29:39	nihilazo	gtg
2022-03-09 11:33:33	twee	i take pride in my print stylesheet
2022-03-09 11:35:35	juspib	i don't like serif fonts for fun stuff
2022-03-09 11:38:10	twee	i do
2022-03-09 11:38:24	twee	serif fonts feel arcane
2022-03-09 11:38:39	twee	sans-serif fonts feel sanitised, corporate, big tech, marketing agency
2022-03-09 11:41:27	juspib	wikipedia feels corporate, big-tech, marketing agency to you?
2022-03-09 11:41:47	juspib	in my mind serifs are reserved for science and news
2022-03-09 11:41:58	twee	wikipedia feels fun to you?
2022-03-09 11:42:03	juspib	yea
2022-03-09 11:42:51	twee	idk
2022-03-09 11:43:10	twee	i mean fonts are a very basic starting point to have feelings about
2022-03-09 11:43:22	juspib	Did you know ... that the 1976 manga series Kaze to Ki no Uta is credited with widely popularizing the male–male romance genre?
2022-03-09 11:43:38	twee	but generally sans serif feels digital and digital-first stuff i tend to have negative feelings about
2022-03-09 11:44:41	dzwdz	did that manga turn people gay or something
2022-03-09 11:44:49	twee	probably
2022-03-09 11:45:32	dzwdz	good
2022-03-09 11:45:35	twee	wish there was a diy mouse scene like the keyboard scene
2022-03-09 11:45:42	twee	i want a sexy three button mouse
2022-03-09 11:46:07	dzwdz	be the change you want to see in the world
2022-03-09 11:46:17	twee	i dont want to start
2022-03-09 11:46:20	twee	im busy
2022-03-09 11:46:33	twee	i want there to be a market and then suport an Independent Creator
2022-03-09 11:52:03	juspib	The mature subject material of Kaze to Ki no Uta and its focus on themes of sadomasochism, incest, and rape were controversial for shōjo manga of the 1970s; it took seven years from Takemiya's initial conceptualization of the story for her editors at the publishing company Shogakukan to agree to publish it.
2022-03-09 11:54:40	dzwdz	what the fuck
2022-03-09 12:00:19	juspib	The series is set in late 19th-century France, primarily at the fictional Lacombrade Academy, an all-boys boarding school located on the outskirts of the city of Arles in Provence.
2022-03-09 12:00:31	juspib	Serge Battour, the teenaged son of a French viscount and a Roma woman, is sent to Lacombrade at the request of his late father. He is roomed with Gilbert Cocteau, a misanthropic student who is ostracized by the school's pupils and professors for his truancy and sexual relations with older male students. Serge's efforts to befriend his roommate, and
2022-03-09 12:00:33	juspib	Gilbert's efforts to simultaneously drive away and seduce Serge, form a complicated and disruptive relationship between the pair.
2022-03-09 12:00:44	juspib	Gilbert's apparent cruelty and promiscuity are the result of a lifetime of neglect and abuse, as perpetrated chiefly by his uncle Auguste Beau. Auguste is a respected figure in French high society who has physically, emotionally, and sexually abused Gilbert since he was a child. His manipulation of Gilbert is so significant that Gilbert believes
2022-03-09 12:00:46	juspib	that the two are in love, and he remains beguiled by Auguste even after he later learns that Auguste is not his uncle, but his biological father
2022-03-09 12:00:54	juspib	Despite threats of ostracism and violence, Serge perseveres in his attempts to bond with Gilbert, and the two eventually become friends and lovers. Faced with rejection by the faculty and students of Lacombrade, Gilbert and Serge flee to Paris and live for a short while as paupers. Gilbert is unable to escape the trauma of his past, and descends
2022-03-09 12:00:56	juspib	into a life of drug use and prostitution. While hallucinating under the influence of opium, he runs in front of a moving carriage and dies under its wheels, convinced that he has seen Auguste. Some of the pair's friends, who have recently rediscovered the couple, find and console the traumatized Serge.

2022-03-09 13:02:22	twee	based.cooking just is pretty shoddy
2022-03-09 13:02:42	tomasino	i just do mine in plain text on gopher
2022-03-09 13:02:52	twee	the fact that luke started it means that there are lots of mediocre recipes added by suckless anti bloat kool aid teens who are just getting into their leet phase
2022-03-09 13:02:54	tomasino	the way god intended, clearly
2022-03-09 13:03:23	twee	i just put any i need in my physical notebook and write them in the index
2022-03-09 13:03:37	twee	occasionally i used to share recipes but now i dont
2022-03-09 13:04:10	extratone	it’s just occurred to me that documentation is probably left vague sometimes because the author forgot how they did something and didn’t feel like bothering to retrace their steps.
2022-03-09 13:04:10	extratone	because it’s happening to me right now.
2022-03-09 13:04:44	twee	also tomasino: cooklang seems significantly better than h-recipe
2022-03-09 13:04:47	twee	https://cooklang.org/
2022-03-09 13:05:45	tomasino	different uses. the idea of a microformat is that every website with their own unique recipe layout can lay in the attributes and you can extract the recipe from that structure
2022-03-09 13:06:13	tomasino	like identity stuff in indyweb. microformats are awesome cause they overlay what you already have
2022-03-09 13:06:30	the_default	the microformat is like a web representation of the recipe?
2022-03-09 13:06:50	tomasino	it's a way to codify the underlying data structure in your existing html
2022-03-09 13:06:58	tomasino	add a tag here or there, bam, now a machine can parse it
2022-03-09 13:07:09	twee	i understand the idea.  i just think that a lot of the ones ive seen are pretty trash, including that one
2022-03-09 13:07:29	twee	then again, im just very disillusioned with indyweb
2022-03-09 13:07:44	tomasino	well, each to their own opinion. it's been around for over a decade now with little tweaks. feels pretty good to me
2022-03-09 13:07:50	the_default	so i'd write my recipies in something like cooklang, then render them as html with the microformat tags

2022-03-09 13:08:41	tomasino	if you are writing a web generator for cooklang i'd suggest adding h-recipe microformat tags to the output
2022-03-09 13:08:42	palmdrop	(I'm at work so shouldn't spend too much time in chat)
2022-03-09 13:08:45	tomasino	best of both worlds
2022-03-09 13:09:49	twee	hey palmdrop
2022-03-09 13:10:01	twee	i guess it's alright as an output format
2022-03-09 13:12:42	tomasino	for YEARS windows had no native calendar app. i bitched about that constantly, and that neither windows nor mac had a recipe program
2022-03-09 13:13:01	tomasino	back in the old days they were two really obvious things that just didn't exist
2022-03-09 13:13:12	tomasino	such a miss

2022-03-09 13:16:01	extratone	either onenote is absolutely horrendous or I don't understand it.

2022-03-09 13:48:21	the_default	i'm thinking about dropping my [further maths] class. i'm pretty sure this is the best choice but i'm not entirely sure so i'm half asking about it. it'd: + give me two extra free lessons per day + give me half the independent work to do at home + allow me to get far better grades in other subjects + be able to start hobbies'n'stuff in my free time
2022-03-09 13:48:23	the_default	+ not be stressed. but: - cannot rejoin course if i quit - i might be wrong
2022-03-09 13:48:26	the_default	sorry for just dumping this

2022-03-09 13:57:22	twee	how much do you know about cassettes rogbeer
2022-03-09 13:58:20	rogbeer	not much. enough to know that my player malfunctioned even after professional repairs that cost quite a substantial amount. and that was in 2016
2022-03-09 13:58:45	twee	ah
2022-03-09 13:58:47	twee	oh well

2022-03-09 13:59:24	rogbeer	oh, I see
2022-03-09 14:00:09	rogbeer	maybe you can check a makerspace or public library near you
2022-03-09 14:00:24	rogbeer	if they have players
2022-03-09 14:00:59	rogbeer	i know my public library has a CD player. (which is likr an ancient relic today).
2022-03-09 14:01:38	rogbeer	i think makerspaces have great potential for building a community
2022-03-09 14:02:22	rogbeer	i hope my suggestions help you, twee

2022-03-09 14:07:02	extratone	twee, you should still be able to find portable cassette players new with a 3.5mm jack for like $19.99 if you just want to listen to one tape.

2022-03-09 14:37:49	twee	nice
2022-03-09 14:38:19	dzwdz	that just looks like you didn't set up any pronouns

2022-03-09 14:40:55	dzwdz	sorry for blueballing you
2022-03-09 14:41:02	dzwdz	dtp had an episode about it
2022-03-09 14:41:21	dzwdz	somewhere around the 120th-130th i believe
2022-03-09 14:41:29	juspib	then i probably heard it but didn't listen
2022-03-09 14:42:21	bx	doesn't this mean theyre gonna end up last everytime someone does something in alphabetical order?
2022-03-09 14:42:39	dzwdz	yes
2022-03-09 14:42:40	bx	cause that can be helpful sometimes
2022-03-09 14:43:00	bx	I get to give all my chem presentations last and so get gur most time to prepare
2022-03-09 14:43:03	dzwdz	yeah, if someone runs `rm --rf /poland/citizens/*` they'll have time to run
2022-03-09 14:43:07	juspib	imagine being the person in class with #1
2022-03-09 14:43:29	@natalia	morning
2022-03-09 14:43:34	dzwdz	she's alright
2022-03-09 14:43:44	dzwdz	but like i wouldn't want to be her
2022-03-09 14:43:51	dzwdz	\o natalia
2022-03-09 14:44:05	bx	morning natalia
2022-03-09 14:45:17	bx	dzwdz: bc of gur name or gur number-1ness?
2022-03-09 14:45:21	juspib	afteenoon
2022-03-09 14:45:36	dzwdz	neither
2022-03-09 14:45:47	dzwdz	i'm talking about a specific human being here
2022-03-09 14:46:19	login	who is she? the person in class with #1?
2022-03-09 14:46:24	juspib	yes
2022-03-09 14:47:06	bx	cue spongebob number 1 meme
2022-03-09 14:48:11	dzwdz	TIL /dev/full
2022-03-09 14:48:31	bx	what is that
2022-03-09 14:48:33	barnaba	how did we arrive at removing polish citizens again?
2022-03-09 14:48:35	bx	catting it does nothing
2022-03-09 14:48:52	bx	barnaba: someone has gur last name alphabetically speaking in poland
2022-03-09 14:49:09	bx	i suggested that it may actully be useful
2022-03-09 14:49:09	twee	i reckon someone has the last name alphabetically speaking in most countries
2022-03-09 14:49:12	twee	with an alphabet
2022-03-09 14:49:17	dzwdz	but he has it on purpose
2022-03-09 14:49:25	bx	twee: True, but do we know who it is for gur others
2022-03-09 14:50:08	twee	https://britishsurnames.co.uk/surnames/Z/?p=104
2022-03-09 14:50:11	twee	bx: starting point
2022-03-09 14:50:11	barnaba	I'm not sure how good bash is at sorting extended ascii chars like Ż
2022-03-09 14:50:56	barnaba	and also this might sound nitpicky but do globs run in alphabetical order?
2022-03-09 14:51:08	twee	https://www.192.com/atoz/people/zziwa/
2022-03-09 14:52:01	bx	barnaba: i dont think so
2022-03-09 14:52:15	bx	im guessing its implementation dependant
2022-03-09 14:52:38	twee	from a very cursory search, person at the bottom of the british register is umar zziwa
2022-03-09 14:53:16	dzwdz	there are definitely british people with surnames starting with ż
2022-03-09 14:53:21	dzwdz	hell, maybe there's a żelisław too
2022-03-09 14:53:36	twee	are you sure officially?
2022-03-09 14:53:39	barnaba	anyhow quick research suggests that if you ever want to remove polish citizens alphabetically, ppl with czech surnames will be the last ones standing
2022-03-09 14:53:40	bx	twee: huh that double zz is gonna get them low down
2022-03-09 14:53:54	twee	it would absolutely not surprise me if the official system only supports 7 bit ascii
2022-03-09 14:54:25	dzwdz	hm
2022-03-09 14:54:42	dzwdz	i'm fine with that, i don't have anything against czechs
2022-03-09 14:54:45	bx	twee: i'd honestly bet on it doing so
2022-03-09 14:54:55	barnaba	žula being behind żyżycz by sort standards
2022-03-09 14:56:06	twee	it gets harder though
2022-03-09 14:56:37	dzwdz	is there a list of all the characters from latin characters in order
2022-03-09 14:57:03	anton	has anyone heard of beon.co.id (a hosting company for web/vps/mail things)?
2022-03-09 14:57:18	twee	like i believe by sort standards 安 comes after anything with z despite sounding like a
2022-03-09 14:57:48	dzwdz	s/latin/\/&\/
2022-03-09 14:57:49	sedbot	<dzwdz> is there a list of all the characters from /latin/ characters in order
2022-03-09 14:57:55	dzwdz	wait fuck
2022-03-09 14:57:57	dzwdz	latin alphabets
2022-03-09 14:58:04	dzwdz	not characters
2022-03-09 14:58:23	twee	not a clue
2022-03-09 14:59:34	dzwdz	wait wh
2022-03-09 14:59:43	dzwdz	apparently macos has php preinstalled
2022-03-09 14:59:53	twee	pro move
2022-03-09 15:00:16	bx	just tried it, it does
2022-03-09 15:00:24	bx	im pretty sure it also has ruby preinstalled tho
2022-03-09 15:00:27	dzwdz	whoa, that's cool
2022-03-09 15:00:42	dzwdz	vim?
2022-03-09 15:01:02	bx	hold on
2022-03-09 15:01:17	dzwdz	emacs?
2022-03-09 15:01:25	dzwdz	ed?
2022-03-09 15:01:25	twee	it used to have emacs preinstalled
2022-03-09 15:01:39	twee	but like 24 or something oldish
2022-03-09 15:02:00	bx	it does have ed
2022-03-09 15:02:15	bx	i dont have emacs
2022-03-09 15:02:25	bx	im trying to remmeber if i installed vim or not
2022-03-09 15:03:00	twee	check for vi
2022-03-09 15:03:02	twee	if it has ed
2022-03-09 15:03:17	juspib	anton no
2022-03-09 15:03:29	juspib	but it looks and sounds sussy af
2022-03-09 15:03:43	bx	vi just opens vim
2022-03-09 15:03:55	twee	i dont think its suspicious
2022-03-09 15:04:02	twee	actually maybe
2022-03-09 15:04:07	twee	it looks hostgator equivalent
2022-03-09 15:04:16	bx	ok vim is preinstalled
2022-03-09 15:04:23	bx	i cant remove it with homebrew
2022-03-09 15:04:24	dzwdz	based
2022-03-09 15:04:46	login	very sus
2022-03-09 15:04:51	bx	it also comes with nano
2022-03-09 15:04:59	dzwdz	you can remove everything with homebrew, you just need to drink enough
2022-03-09 15:05:09	bx	Naw i got high
2022-03-09 15:05:11	bx	tolerance
2022-03-09 15:05:46	login	nano = ?
2022-03-09 15:05:52	login	the text editor?
2022-03-09 15:05:57	bx	yes
2022-03-09 15:07:03	extratone	idk if y’all would enjoy hearing Nilay Patel interview the Raspberry Pi guy. I’m looking forward to maybe actually hearing a conversation about technology? https://www.theverge.com/22966155/raspberry-pi-ceo-interview-eben-upton-computer-chip-shortage-diy
2022-03-09 15:08:45	twee	bring back microcomputers
2022-03-09 15:09:21	extratone	o nope... it looks like it's mostly about the business and the story.
2022-03-09 15:09:27	extratone	foiled again.
2022-03-09 15:10:11	juspib	wdym microcomputers
2022-03-09 15:10:32	twee	80s keyboard boxes
2022-03-09 15:10:49	dzwdz	like rpi400?
2022-03-09 15:11:09	bx	extratone: oh this is intresting still though
2022-03-09 15:11:12	anton	juspib: I got a spam email from someone using their service (the typical person is dying and I need to donate per money to a charity of some sorts), and I was wondering if it would be worth reporting the email to the host
2022-03-09 15:11:12	twee	i guess
2022-03-09 15:11:18	twee	i want to watch some "why we don't have internet" videos, like those "why we don't have a tv" videos, but searching the former brings up wifi troubleshooting
2022-03-09 15:11:31	juspib	"microcomputer" was a name to tell the size difference from mainframes
2022-03-09 15:11:32	dzwdz	rip the typical person
2022-03-09 15:12:31	extratone	as I've said here before - if I am example of the computer-bent sort of my peers, any sort of exposure to hardware and hardware people is desperately needed.
2022-03-09 15:13:06	extratone	I learned SO much about life, literally, from just two years in high school electronics classes lol
2022-03-09 15:13:34	dzwdz	ive been messing around with the old computers at my school and i love it
2022-03-09 15:13:47	extratone	<3
2022-03-09 15:14:00	bx	i like hardware, but it feels like most of gur time what i want to do with it turns out to have already been done and my version will perform crapily in comparison
2022-03-09 15:14:13	juspib	i hate computers
2022-03-09 15:14:16	dzwdz	i'm suprised that it took until today for something to explode
2022-03-09 15:14:21	bx	...
2022-03-09 15:14:21	dzwdz	juspib: ^
2022-03-09 15:14:22	extratone	well yeah. that's the gist of academic hardware stuff lol
2022-03-09 15:14:38	bx	I'd love to make a descrete component cpu
2022-03-09 15:14:42	extratone	I was absolutely terrible at it.
2022-03-09 15:14:55	extratone	still am.
2022-03-09 15:15:06	bx	but it probs wont even break 20MHz, which you can get out of a < £2 atmega mcu
2022-03-09 15:15:16	dzwdz	what's the point of that
2022-03-09 15:15:23	extratone	yeah but ... you'd have made *your own CPU*
2022-03-09 15:15:23	dzwdz	it's 20 million instructions
2022-03-09 15:15:42	bx	dzwdz: im not sure what you mean
2022-03-09 15:15:43	extratone	if you get there, I wouldn't chide yourself about the redundancy lol
2022-03-09 15:15:46	dzwdz	i bet you won't even be able to think up a million instructions
2022-03-09 15:16:04	bx	dzwdz: my compiler easily can
2022-03-09 15:16:05	extratone	"pee urself" x 20million boom
2022-03-09 15:16:25	dzwdz	also the human hearing ends at 20KHz
2022-03-09 15:16:29	bx	plus speed limits it's application
2022-03-09 15:16:33	dzwdz	no point going past that
2022-03-09 15:16:42	bx	idealy i'd build a hardware varvara
2022-03-09 15:16:47	extratone	theoretical human hearing ends there. lmk if anybody in this chat can hear past 18 lol
2022-03-09 15:17:01	dzwdz	i think i was able to
2022-03-09 15:17:02	extratone	I'll bet I'm down to like 15 now.
2022-03-09 15:17:04	bx	extratone: havent tried
2022-03-09 15:17:21	bx	dont want too, if i score low im just gonna get real sad
2022-03-09 15:17:56	extratone	don't! I wear my bad hearing with pride because it survived growing up on a farm AND a punk adolescence
2022-03-09 15:18:15	bx	should a farm *help* your hearing
2022-03-09 15:18:22	bx	gur city noise is part of what destroys it
2022-03-09 15:19:02	extratone	lol that depends on how you define "farm." it was not a uh... recreational farm.
2022-03-09 15:19:05	bx	(also i meant id just feel bad cause like, im not happy about my body's functionality degrading out of my control)
2022-03-09 15:19:20	juspib	yeah people are being tricked into buying CPUs because of big numbers
2022-03-09 15:19:20	extratone	farming is a cacophony of diesel engines and screaming.
2022-03-09 15:19:21	bx	extratone: farm = place where food is grown
2022-03-09 15:19:39	juspib	NO ONE needs a million instructions a second
2022-03-09 15:19:39	extratone	yeah but people call 20 acre farmer's market type shit farms now.
2022-03-09 15:19:44	bx	extratone: what? where are all gur tranquil crop fields
2022-03-09 15:20:01	extratone	I mean, the environment itself is tranquil. the JOB is loud as hell.
2022-03-09 15:20:06	bx	aw
2022-03-09 15:20:20	extratone	and loud as hell for sustained periods of time.
2022-03-09 15:20:23	bx	can you get away with wearing ear protection
2022-03-09 15:20:59	extratone	oh I'm sure we'd have worn it if we'd known.
2022-03-09 15:21:20	bx	........
2022-03-09 15:21:30	extratone	it'd have to be real comfortable though lol
2022-03-09 15:21:41	m455	i do not miss working on farms lol
2022-03-09 15:21:47	extratone	^
2022-03-09 15:21:49	bx	most things are more comfortable than gur sustained sound of a disel enginer
2022-03-09 15:22:11	bx	i probs have a much nicer image of farming in my brain
2022-03-09 15:22:15	m455	had a good friend in highschool with an abusive step father who refused to buy machines to help them weed and harvest stuff, so we did lands and lands of removing rocks and weed with just 2 buckets each by hand
2022-03-09 15:22:21	extratone	I guess that's down to taste lol. I absolutely loved every minute I got to operate machinery. everything else sucked.
2022-03-09 15:22:27	bx	i think im picturing like sustinance farming, not mass produciton
2022-03-09 15:22:37	juspib	i have never participated in farming but i'm certain it's awesome
2022-03-09 15:22:43	m455	and then harvesting corn is a fucking nightmare iwth how much you get cut from the husk, or how you dont wanna eat it anymore from all the worms you see in them lol
2022-03-09 15:23:04	bx	extratone: i mean machines *are* fun, but machine loudness sucks imo
2022-03-09 15:23:10	m455	bx: this was like a super small farm, without machines, and it's still a shit load of work
2022-03-09 15:23:11	twee	im heading off now, byebye town
2022-03-09 15:23:13	juspib	wrooooom
2022-03-09 15:23:17	juspib	byebye

2022-03-09 15:23:25	twee	o/
2022-03-09 15:23:38	bx	m455: i imagined itd be like, hard but rewarding
2022-03-09 15:23:45	bx	also gur worms are just extra protien
2022-03-09 15:23:46	m455	it was like working in fast food, but even more physically draining lol
2022-03-09 15:23:58	bx	though dropping them back in gur ground is good for gur soil
2022-03-09 15:24:04	m455	bx: hahaha well we brought them to hte nearbye town to sell them, so it wasn't an option :P
2022-03-09 15:24:07	extratone	maybe in a different soft of society. family farms have never made money.
2022-03-09 15:24:12	m455	it wasn't very rewarding for me lol
2022-03-09 15:24:21	bx	m455: that's gur worst endorsment for anything i've ever heard
2022-03-09 15:24:22	m455	and the amount of money you get for that physical work is like nothing
2022-03-09 15:24:24	extratone	bx that's a federal crime in the united states.
2022-03-09 15:24:28	m455	bx: LOL!
2022-03-09 15:24:40	bx	extratone: what is?
2022-03-09 15:24:46	bx	gur worm dropping?
2022-03-09 15:24:52	extratone	reusing seed.
2022-03-09 15:24:59	bx	Wym
2022-03-09 15:25:05	bx	how do you reuse a seed
2022-03-09 15:25:12	bx	you put it in and it becomes a plant
2022-03-09 15:25:24	juspib	easy
2022-03-09 15:25:35	extratone	sorry I thought you were talking about taking a portion of the harvested seed and using it for seed the following year.
2022-03-09 15:25:42	juspib	if you use a seed to make a plant, then eating or selling that plant is reusing
2022-03-09 15:25:46	bx	extratone: wait
2022-03-09 15:25:50	bx	why would you NOT do that
2022-03-09 15:25:52	extratone	which is how farming worked for its whole history until the 20th century.
2022-03-09 15:25:56	bx	^
2022-03-09 15:26:00	bx	THATS GUR OBVIOUS WAY
2022-03-09 15:26:08	bx	WHY IS THAT A CRIME
2022-03-09 15:26:09	m455	capitalism lol
2022-03-09 15:26:21	extratone	because the seed's composition is protected by (IP law?) it's not called that but it's very similar
2022-03-09 15:26:41	m455	i'm happy with my small vegetable garden i grow now, but yeah i could not go to working on a farm ever again lol
2022-03-09 15:26:45	extratone	welcome to the infinitely many ways farmers are fucked and have been fucked.
2022-03-09 15:26:57	bx	i wouldnt consider myself a violent person, but who ever came up with that does not deserve to keep their heart or brain
2022-03-09 15:27:09	m455	i'd be happy with a bigger yard to garden vegetables but not for selling, because it just becomes inhumanely,  a lot of work (for me lol)
2022-03-09 15:27:23	extratone	I mean, they're also the reason we've grown fourfold in global population since my grandfather was born.
2022-03-09 15:27:27	juspib	removing someone's heart and brain sounds hot
2022-03-09 15:27:54	bx	i guess their insides'd be warm
2022-03-09 15:27:56	<--	palmdrop (palmdrop@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)

2022-03-09 15:28:30	bx	as in powered by steam?
2022-03-09 15:28:53	extratone	yup. everything you think of in a steam rail locomotive except with huge wheels and a steering wheel.
2022-03-09 15:28:58	extratone	they even have whistles 
2022-03-09 15:29:02	bx	thats kinda cool
2022-03-09 15:29:18	extratone	they're moody and deafening and smelly and amazing.
2022-03-09 15:29:28	bx	ok less cool
2022-03-09 15:29:45	bx	unless its a good smell
2022-03-09 15:29:55	juspib	its a good smell
2022-03-09 15:29:57	bx	and their moodyness happens to match mine
2022-03-09 15:30:08	juspib	everything that has to do with coal smells good
2022-03-09 15:30:40	bx	it certainly does not
2022-03-09 15:30:53	bx	What do you think of gur smell of disel / petroλ?
2022-03-09 15:30:57	bx	*petrol
2022-03-09 15:31:04	juspib	sometimes i redirect my furnace from the chimney to the house so i can smell the smoke
2022-03-09 15:31:15	bx	dude what
2022-03-09 15:31:19	bx	that's so bad for your
2022-03-09 15:31:21	bx	lungs
2022-03-09 15:31:53	bx	like im pretty sure chimneys were invented *because* of how bad that was
2022-03-09 15:32:27	<--	ju (jmjl@localhost) has quit (connection closed)
2022-03-09 15:32:29	-->	ju (jmjl@localhost) has joined #tildetown
2022-03-09 15:33:39	extratone	list of my favorite smells in the world. 1. kerosene, 2. diesel, 3. gasoline.
2022-03-09 15:34:13	extratone	kerosene is that real good shit... it's been tool long but I don't know where to get it anymore.
2022-03-09 15:35:01	bx	extratone: its lamp / lighter fuel right
2022-03-09 15:35:20	bx	so you can probs order it as a lighter refill for a zippo or such
2022-03-09 15:35:36	extratone	yup that's what it's relegated to now. but for a while in the early 20th century, tractors and stationary reciprocating engines ran on kerosene.
2022-03-09 15:35:51	bx	also, yall have continued gur trend of when i ask people about gur disel/petrol smell they either love it hate it or it makes them feel sick
2022-03-09 15:35:52	extratone	I just found it online at walmart lmao
2022-03-09 15:36:15	bx	(it makes me feel sick)
2022-03-09 15:36:23	bx	extratone: nice
2022-03-09 15:36:38	bx	either way im just really curios if it's hereditory or not
2022-03-09 15:36:45	bx	and if someone has a nueteral opinion
2022-03-09 15:36:55	bx	extratone: do your parents like gur smell of disel
2022-03-09 15:37:55	extratone	well my mother cannot smell and never has been able to (apparently due to cigarette exposure as an infant) and I saw my dad use diesel fuel as insect repellent once so..
2022-03-09 15:38:13	extratone	I doubt my dad would be like "I love the smell of diesel." though lol
2022-03-09 15:38:23	bx	but he does like it?
2022-03-09 15:38:44	extratone	I think he would miss it if it were suddenly gone, if that's enough of an answer.
2022-03-09 15:38:49	bx	it is
2022-03-09 15:38:56	bx	that's more than nueteral
2022-03-09 15:39:03	extratone	speaking of which, you have something to look forward to in the EV future! and I have something to look forward to... for you lol
2022-03-09 15:39:24	bx	whats that
2022-03-09 15:39:43	extratone	less ambient gas/diesel smells, generally, since they make you sick.
2022-03-09 15:39:51	bx	ah
2022-03-09 15:40:12	extratone	granted we're all going to have to spend most of our freetime disposing of batteries.
2022-03-09 15:40:18	bx	i mean it only kicks in if im like standing right next to it, e.g. if soemoen is filling up their engine
2022-03-09 15:40:39	bx	ive got a bag of AAs i refuse to outright throw away
2022-03-09 15:40:59	bx	Cause a) maybe ill takem them for recycling sometime b) they have carbon rods in them
2022-03-09 15:41:06	extratone	well the way things are going, I think that's going to look more and more appealing lol
2022-03-09 15:41:19	bx	idk what i can use carbon rods for
2022-03-09 15:41:25	bx	maybe art?
2022-03-09 15:41:42	extratone	ooo that's a much more creative thought than I had.
2022-03-09 15:42:07	bx	that being said almost everything can be used for art somehow
2022-03-09 15:42:36	extratone	well thank you for giving me some hope for the future.
2022-03-09 15:43:05	bx	that wasnt what i was going for but youre welcome :D
2022-03-09 15:47:23	juspib	imagine you meet someone and think you migbt become friends and then you learn they dont use vim as primary editor
2022-03-09 15:48:45	extratone	I feel that way about Drafts.
2022-03-09 15:49:15	extratone	except I don't know anybody outside the Drafts "community" who uses Drafts, so I have 0 friends.
2022-03-09 15:49:25	bx	What is Drafts
2022-03-09 15:50:25	bx	juspib: my version of that is probs people who think mayo is a good idea (tho its not a hard rule)
2022-03-09 15:54:52	bx	ok im gonna log off for now
2022-03-09 15:54:54	bx	laters
2022-03-09 15:54:57	 *	anton is disappointed in himself for letting an online group nearly ruin what he thought of free software :(
2022-03-09 15:55:01	anton	bye bx
2022-03-09 15:56:09	extratone	bx I'll evangelize Drafts another time hehe.
2022-03-09 15:57:02	elly	morning :)
2022-03-09 15:57:14	juspib	mayo is great
2022-03-09 15:57:34	anton	morning elly
2022-03-09 15:57:45	juspib	afternoon
2022-03-09 15:57:48	anton	evening
2022-03-09 15:57:57	dozens	gnight!
2022-03-09 15:58:06	m455	good mornafternoonevening!
2022-03-09 15:58:19	anton	good $time
2022-03-09 15:58:33	dozens	i still like 'good arcning'
2022-03-09 15:58:48	m455	haha what's the arc refer to in that?
2022-03-09 15:58:49	dozens	as in, wherever you are on the planet's rotation
2022-03-09 15:58:53	m455	hahaha sick
2022-03-09 15:59:12	@natalia	tzag all
2022-03-09 15:59:16	@natalia	what's popping
2022-03-09 15:59:30	m455	haha tzag bud
2022-03-09 15:59:43	m455	i am having a style guide debate with a developer at work LOL
2022-03-09 15:59:45	m455	how about you?
2022-03-09 15:59:50	anton	I'm thinking of emailing my university's IT support team to see why exactly I cannot log into to email from free software clients like mutt and alpine
2022-03-09 16:00:05	@natalia	what's the debate m455
2022-03-09 16:00:17	@natalia	anton: well, why can't you?
2022-03-09 16:00:20	anton	I was able to back when they used google, and for a bit after they switched to O365, but it hasn't worked for a while now
2022-03-09 16:00:26	@natalia	does it not have imap/smtp?
2022-03-09 16:00:32	anton	it does
2022-03-09 16:00:54	@natalia	what other clients have you tried?
2022-03-09 16:01:01	anton	mutt just says login failed, and alpine after a few fails brings up some thing that I need to authorise something or other
2022-03-09 16:01:20	m455	natalia: literally i changed a note like... block kind of, to a deprecation block because of the mention of a date that a deprecation will occur, so they changed it to a caution because it mentions a  possible point of failure, but like... it's a fucking deprecation lollll
2022-03-09 16:01:42	juspib	extratone what's drafts
2022-03-09 16:01:55	m455	this is why style guides exist: so i dont have to waste time as an editor debating with someone lol. i dont mind getting another opinion on something, but this back and forth has gone on too long lol
2022-03-09 16:02:45	m455	debates for changing rules in the style guide i'm totally cool with. those are always constructive lol
2022-03-09 16:02:59	m455	just dont have the bandwidth for it today xDDD
2022-03-09 16:03:03	anton	I kind of like using mutt more, at least because of how I have it configured, but I cannot log in with it for who knows why
2022-03-09 16:03:35	@natalia	tbh you will probably have more trouble contacting tech support like anywhere about trying to use a pretty obscure mail client
2022-03-09 16:03:54	@natalia	http://www.charlesmercadal.com/technology/alpine/2019/06/21/alpine-office365.html i found this
2022-03-09 16:05:51	juspib	what does it mean when someone responds with "uhh pinterest" when i ask them for duck pics
2022-03-09 16:06:30	juspib	oh i think it means they haven't taken the photos themselves
2022-03-09 16:06:51	extratone	I'm assuming it means that pinterest results have overwhelmed whatever search engine they're using and they've given up.
2022-03-09 16:08:04	nihilazo	\o
2022-03-09 16:08:12	extratone	juspib: my repo for Drafts configs probably explains better than I could. https://github.com/extratone/drafts
2022-03-09 16:09:40	juspib	your repo doesn't explain a single thing other than the license used
2022-03-09 16:13:19	juspib	didn't mean that to sound rude
2022-03-09 16:13:34	extratone	oh... well. Drafts is a text editor. here’s an image. https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/psalmsrefresh.png
2022-03-09 16:13:59	elly	m455: one of my favorite cultural norms at work is "we can argue about the style guide but it has to be done on the style guide mailing list, not on the individual pull request"
2022-03-09 16:14:01	extratone	well if it don't explain it it don't explain it. 
2022-03-09 16:14:14	extratone	oh god.
2022-03-09 16:14:37	m455	elly: that sounds like what humans should do lol
2022-03-09 16:14:46	extratone	https://getdrafts.com is the landing page btw, juspib. probably should've just started with that lol
2022-03-09 16:15:10	m455	elly: our internal style guide explicitely states what this should be, and this context doesn't create an ambigious problem, which is the more annoying part lol
2022-03-09 16:15:15	elly	yeah
2022-03-09 16:15:19	elly	well
2022-03-09 16:15:35	m455	and like, i've made soo many recommendations and changes about problematic things in the style that got changed, so i'm not trying to be a dictator with it lol
2022-03-09 16:15:37	elly	let they who have never wanted to write "but the style guide is *wrong*" cast the first stone, or whatever
2022-03-09 16:15:46	m455	LOL!!
2022-03-09 16:16:04	extratone	sounds like it might be time to rewrite it from scratch if that's the case
2022-03-09 16:16:38	extratone	if I was running a company with a company document everybody was scared of, burning it would be my first instinct.
2022-03-09 16:17:02	extratone	then again, my one company failed badly so lol
2022-03-09 16:17:10	m455	extratone: i dont think destroying the style guide because of one sentence would be needed :P
2022-03-09 16:17:29	nihilazo	new css attempt https://tilde.town/~nihilazo/
2022-03-09 16:17:32	elly	hopefully nobody is scared of the style guide
2022-03-09 16:17:53	m455	haha they are definitely not xD
2022-03-09 16:18:03	extratone	very clean nihilazo! 
2022-03-09 16:18:17	juspib	if i was running a company i'd make impalement the punishment for questioning the style guide
2022-03-09 16:18:28	m455	we literally just rewrote it too because the old one was..... very very bad and outdated (the editors and tech writers split into two teams, one for help documentation and one for developer documentation, so we needed very different style guides)
2022-03-09 16:18:30	@natalia	i like the style
2022-03-09 16:18:31	extratone	yeah that was my other thought except it was obliteration.
2022-03-09 16:18:41	m455	nihilazo: oh i really like this!!
2022-03-09 16:18:46	nihilazo	thanks!
2022-03-09 16:18:53	@natalia	i've been considering trying to update my website but i kind of like it how it is..
2022-03-09 16:18:53	nihilazo	I hope this is still like, smol web friendly
2022-03-09 16:18:57	@natalia	(equa.space)
2022-03-09 16:18:59	nihilazo	I added 40kb of fonts
2022-03-09 16:19:02	@natalia	mostly just like, font changes
2022-03-09 16:19:03	nihilazo	that's not too much right
2022-03-09 16:19:16	elly	I wouldn't think so
2022-03-09 16:19:17	nihilazo	and I have a bit of css3 animation for the rainbow links
2022-03-09 16:19:28	nihilazo	but the site all functions perfectly without any of that, it's just extras
2022-03-09 16:19:36	juspib	nihilazo is it similar to the old one or is my browser hugging the cache?
2022-03-09 16:19:47	anton	extratone: unlicense?
2022-03-09 16:19:53	nihilazo	it's quite different juspit
2022-03-09 16:19:58	nihilazo	juspib
2022-03-09 16:20:04	elly	nihilazo: looks good to me!
2022-03-09 16:20:06	@natalia	Charis (otherwise known as Charter) has been growing on me
2022-03-09 16:20:16	@natalia	nihilazo: i can see the fonts on the pages that aren't the index
2022-03-09 16:20:24	@natalia	so, uh, might be cache
2022-03-09 16:21:10	nihilazo	can or can't?
2022-03-09 16:21:11	nihilazo	wait a sec
2022-03-09 16:21:12	m455	nihilazo: the title/link thing at the top that is pink is a comic-sansy looking font
2022-03-09 16:21:27	extratone	nihilazo, I know you didn’t ask for an iPhone mockup but here’s one anyway. https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/nihilazo.png
2022-03-09 16:21:32	m455	i think i have caching disabled on my browser though, because i fuck around with css on my homepage way too much hahaha
2022-03-09 16:21:33	extratone	since it's basically all I can do.
2022-03-09 16:21:33	@natalia	OH it's a. https issue?
2022-03-09 16:21:56	@natalia	my firefox can't load the fonts thru http for some reason
2022-03-09 16:21:59	anton	https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#Unlicense & https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:TheUnlicense
2022-03-09 16:22:33	extratone	yes that, but with my own commentary lol. https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1
2022-03-09 16:22:44	nihilazo	the font is comic neue m455
2022-03-09 16:22:46	nihilazo	it should be that font
2022-03-09 16:22:59	extratone	it's a placeholder until I finish my own public domain-equivalent license, anton.
2022-03-09 16:23:03	elly	the fonts and stuff all load fine over https
2022-03-09 16:23:15	@natalia	> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://tilde.town/ComicNeue-Bold.woff2. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).
2022-03-09 16:23:25	@natalia	so it's trying to load the fonts from tilde.town?
2022-03-09 16:23:29	nihilazo	wait it shouldn't be
2022-03-09 16:23:32	anton	why not GPL, AGPL, or just something like CC0?
2022-03-09 16:23:38	@natalia	but the stylesheet is on your separate domain
2022-03-09 16:23:50	nihilazo	yeah that was a small mistake I just fixed, try reloading it
2022-03-09 16:24:24	@natalia	it's still CORS-ing
2022-03-09 16:24:30	@natalia	because it's still loading the itwont.work css
2022-03-09 16:24:33	@natalia	to my understanding
2022-03-09 16:24:47	nihilazo	huh, I'm confused. idk how to make my thing load the fonts from where it should
2022-03-09 16:24:56	@natalia	i frankly don't understnad most of cors mechanics myself--it only doesn't work over unencrypted http
2022-03-09 16:25:28	@natalia	you can just load `style.css` instead of `itwont.work/style.css` though right?
2022-03-09 16:25:48	anton	for some reason the app of the day links on https://getdrafts.com/index are invisible unless I'm hovering the mouse over them
2022-03-09 16:25:53	extratone	anton, the answer to that isn't all that interesting but basically, I'm not satisfied with those, if that makes sense. I need my license to be funny.
2022-03-09 16:26:18	nihilazo	natalia: wouldn't that not work on pages that are in subdirectories?
2022-03-09 16:26:58	nihilazo	idk web mechanics
2022-03-09 16:27:02	elly	yeah it won't
2022-03-09 16:27:05	@natalia	oh true
2022-03-09 16:27:13	m455	nihilazo: is it like a funny little bug where you might have to load them from /~nihilazo/your-style-sheet.css instead of /stylesheet.css ?
2022-03-09 16:27:15	elly	relative URLs are generally relative to the directory of the page you loaded
2022-03-09 16:27:35	@natalia	maybe still an absolute url at tilde.town will help you with cors
2022-03-09 16:27:51	@natalia	why does tilde.town still serve over http Honestly
2022-03-09 16:27:56	anton	is this program available on things besides nonfree macos and ios?
2022-03-09 16:28:07	elly	I don't quite understand why the https one doesn't complain about cors to be honest
2022-03-09 16:28:13	elly	there are no cors headers either way
2022-03-09 16:28:20	@natalia	wait. wait
2022-03-09 16:28:24	@natalia	https everywhere is discontinued!?
2022-03-09 16:28:42	elly	what?
2022-03-09 16:29:15	elly	ok, plain http now loads the fonts for me too
2022-03-09 16:29:22	elly	so maybe some bad state was cached somewhere
2022-03-09 16:29:30	nihilazo	I also just pushed a change
2022-03-09 16:29:31	nihilazo	so that might be it
2022-03-09 16:29:41	nihilazo	now it's loading the css from /~nihilazo/style.css
2022-03-09 16:29:57	anton	natalia: I think web browsers have that as a setting now
2022-03-09 16:30:11	anton	so in theory you don't need a plugin for https everywhere anymore
2022-03-09 16:30:16	@natalia	i was about to be like "can we add tilde.town to https everywhere's list"
2022-03-09 16:30:18	@natalia	i see
2022-03-09 16:30:23	extratone	anton, the simple answer is no, Drafts is not avilable outside iOS/macOS, nor is it open source.
2022-03-09 16:30:32	anton	yikes
2022-03-09 16:30:48	nihilazo	well I mean it's a macOS/iOS native app
2022-03-09 16:30:57	nihilazo	it's not gonna run on other stuff bc it uses those toolkits and whatever
2022-03-09 16:30:58	elly	natalia: we could if we wanted to, via https://hstspreload.org/?domain=tilde.town
2022-03-09 16:31:03	@natalia	i see!
2022-03-09 16:31:13	extratone	native native. like super native.
2022-03-09 16:31:16	 *	anton has antonmcclure.com with hsts
2022-03-09 16:31:29	elly	anton: no you don't
2022-03-09 16:31:33	elly	https://hstspreload.org/?domain=antonmcclure.com
2022-03-09 16:31:44	anton	huh
2022-03-09 16:31:53	elly	although you do redirect http -> https it seems
2022-03-09 16:32:19	@natalia	what happens if you have the header but aren't in the list, out of interest?
2022-03-09 16:32:29	elly	the very first request may be HTTP
2022-03-09 16:32:30	@natalia	is it a friendly way to redirect without forcing https?
2022-03-09 16:32:37	elly	then browsers will locally cache that you have HSTS
2022-03-09 16:32:43	elly	and all subsequent requests are HTTPS only
2022-03-09 16:33:05	anton	wtf
2022-03-09 16:33:23	elly	you can also serve a temporary or permanent redirect from http to https if you want and not send HSTS headers, but then you don't get the benefits of HSTS
2022-03-09 16:33:55	anton	I had a typo
2022-03-09 16:34:10	@natalia	are there any town-specific downsides of hsts i'm not thinking of
2022-03-09 16:34:21	m455	(oh cool, just looked up what HSTS is lol)
2022-03-09 16:34:24	elly	the main downside is that if your https config ever breaks, users can't fall back to HTTP
2022-03-09 16:34:25	juspib	we commit manageable amounts of trollage
2022-03-09 16:34:30	@natalia	hmmm
2022-03-09 16:35:03	m455	ohhh maybe i wont add hsts then haha. i think certbot just redirects http to https when i renew certs so i think i'm okay lol
2022-03-09 16:35:20	elly	HSTS is essentially a committment that you promise to have working HTTPS for at least the lifetime expressed in the HSTS header
2022-03-09 16:35:26	elly	and if you fail to do so your page stops loading
2022-03-09 16:35:32	anton	extratone: do you or someone else develop drafts?
2022-03-09 16:35:58	extratone	not me! Drafts is developed by a man named Greg Pierce.
2022-03-09 16:36:09	anton	oh
2022-03-09 16:36:12	juspib	not only proprietary but locked down to mac bruh
2022-03-09 16:36:22	m455	ohhh that's interesting! i probably dfon't have the time to make that commitment aha
2022-03-09 16:36:27	m455	very cool though!
2022-03-09 16:36:32	extratone	I've published quite a few themes and configurables for it.
2022-03-09 16:37:01	anton	juspib: what would be a good acronym for "<recursive acronym>'s Not Draft"
2022-03-09 16:37:08	@natalia	....mdn changed their design and i dont like it
2022-03-09 16:37:09	anton	AND's Not Draft?
2022-03-09 16:37:28	anton	something along those lines, we go from A to Z to find an acronym if AND won't work
2022-03-09 16:37:50	@natalia	i hate to be all woman yells at cloud about it but i am looking for hsts docs there and Man
2022-03-09 16:38:03	m455	natalia: yeah i dont like it either. i had ot reference some of hteir docs at work, and it feels very.... not to profile colors and style, but like cryptocurrency vibey?
2022-03-09 16:38:26	elly	it's a shame, MDN is really useful
2022-03-09 16:38:30	m455	yeah!
2022-03-09 16:38:52	m455	elly: i am learning all kinds of things about workers from their docs, that i didnt evne know they had from this one big project i'm on
2022-03-09 16:39:01	m455	sounds like some super cool things you can manage with APIs lol
2022-03-09 16:39:15	anton	Draft's website shouldn't be able to call itself "free" since it's not free software.
2022-03-09 16:39:23	nihilazo	anton: it's free though
2022-03-09 16:39:24	extratone	my last thing about Drafts to link: this thing that’s just turned into a brag about my own setup, basically, but is maybe getting somewhere. https://tilde.town/~extratone/draftsidian
2022-03-09 16:39:25	nihilazo	it costs nothing
2022-03-09 16:39:30	anton	it's nonfree
2022-03-09 16:39:34	nihilazo	it is free in the sense that everybody except rms understands the word
2022-03-09 16:39:36	nihilazo	lmfao
2022-03-09 16:39:56	juspib	it costs your soul
2022-03-09 16:40:04	nihilazo	if we trust rms it's only free if it's distributed under the aftnuarvfnuarifvnarfvnfrtpl v44
2022-03-09 16:40:11	extratone	Drafts is one of those subscription apps with a free tier that is genuinely useful, though.
2022-03-09 16:40:13	nihilazo	with a bajillion conditions
2022-03-09 16:40:14	nihilazo	lol
2022-03-09 16:40:25	@natalia	please dont make me put on my mod hat about derailing discussions with free software evangelism
2022-03-09 16:40:32	anton	nihilazo: YIKES
2022-03-09 16:40:38	nihilazo	(not really, but I'm not a fan of the GNU style free software stuff. But either way, drafts seems like a cool app)
2022-03-09 16:40:46	nihilazo	I'm joking anton
2022-03-09 16:40:52	anton	bad joke :/
2022-03-09 16:40:53	extratone	I've been paying for Drafts since I was making $7.50 an hour at a tool store more than 10 years ago and imo I haven't paid nearly enough.
2022-03-09 16:40:54	juspib	there's exactly four conditions to call software free
2022-03-09 16:41:00	nihilazo	yeah I know
2022-03-09 16:41:02	elly	extratone: nice
2022-03-09 16:41:03	nihilazo	I was making a shit joke
2022-03-09 16:42:28	extratone	I believe in FOSS but my Drafts story is full of developer/user interaction I've never experienced with any open source project. but that's not a fair comparison, really.
2022-03-09 16:43:00	extratone	that said, Greg could straight up decide to kill it for no reason and I would have absolutely zero options.
2022-03-09 16:43:21	m455	extratone: that sounds pretty reasonable, i dont think the free software stuff does much focus on community or how to treat other humans, so inheredtely someone might get a lot of bad interactions from a community focused around it, but that's just my theory
2022-03-09 16:44:08	anton	I don't believe in FOSS
2022-03-09 16:44:08	m455	whereas you are trying to engage with the developer about a software you enjoy, and you are tryign to genuinely contribute, so you are trying to communicate in a way that benefits you both (probably not doing that actively but yeah lol)
2022-03-09 16:44:23	anton	I believe in free software
2022-03-09 16:44:29	nihilazo	I believe 100% in devs working with users
2022-03-09 16:44:31	nihilazo	that's very important
2022-03-09 16:44:35	nihilazo	no matter what licence the software is under
2022-03-09 16:44:43	anton	ok so here is a list of acronyms
2022-03-09 16:44:44	anton	http://antonmcclure.org/2022/acronym.txt
2022-03-09 16:44:58	@natalia	woah
2022-03-09 16:44:59	extratone	come to think of it, I'm not sure why Greg wouldn't open source it.
2022-03-09 16:45:12	anton	I think "AND" or "END" is pronounceable?
2022-03-09 16:45:14	elly	what do you believe *about* free software, though?
2022-03-09 16:45:38	elly	extratone: I've used a couple of apps like this (one-person things with long lifespans that are closed source) and more often than anything else it's because they are embarassed about their code :P
2022-03-09 16:46:12	@natalia	why do you need to name this hypothetical text editor based on a single text editor you dont like
2022-03-09 16:46:24	@natalia	it can just be a text editor
2022-03-09 16:46:51	extratone	considering how embarrasing some of the support requests I've filed over the years have been, I know my vision is far too obscured to ever see that, elly lol
2022-03-09 16:47:15	elly	extratone: yeah
2022-03-09 16:47:22	@natalia	it seems confusing to me to try to design a new piece of software off of a thing you havent used and dont understand the use of
2022-03-09 16:47:32	@natalia	honestly mad respects to this dev this seems like a solid piece of software
2022-03-09 16:47:40	elly	for real though, when you've worked on the same source code for many years and the early parts of the code are probably stuff you aren't that proud of
2022-03-09 16:47:43	extratone	but I can tell you that I break everything and have tried a whole bunch, that I live in my text spaces, and that I've come to deeply trust Drafts.
2022-03-09 16:47:49	anton	natalia: it's a play on how the naming for the GNU operating system (GNU's Not Unix) is
2022-03-09 16:47:59	elly	I would definitely be like "I don't necessarily want people to look at that and think that's how I work"
2022-03-09 16:48:31	@natalia	terry cavanagh open sourced the vvvvvv code and it's like a Mess
2022-03-09 16:48:40	@natalia	(a platformer game)
2022-03-09 16:48:40	nihilazo	what is the D that you are saying it's not anton
2022-03-09 16:48:42	m455	amazing lol
2022-03-09 16:48:48	elly	natalia: yeah
2022-03-09 16:48:53	anton	Drafts
2022-03-09 16:49:02	nihilazo	oh. Why are you trying to make an editor that's not drafts
2022-03-09 16:49:12	nihilazo	just because you don't like the fact that an app you don't use isn't foss? lmao
2022-03-09 16:49:28	@natalia	i dont like apple that much ut it's interesting to see it as like, the only platform where people actually get paid for making apps that are good
2022-03-09 16:49:29	anton	https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.en.html#FOSS
2022-03-09 16:49:34	nihilazo	(or isn't "free software", my bad, those are apparently distinct in a way I don't understand
2022-03-09 16:49:42	extratone	to be fair, Drafts is fuckin weird. 
2022-03-09 16:49:48	elly	dude can you please try to have more original contributions to the discussion
2022-03-09 16:49:56	@natalia	> please dont make me put on my mod hat about derailing discussions with free software evangelism
2022-03-09 16:50:10	m455	natalia: re: "i dont like apple that much ...": damn i never thought about that lol
2022-03-09 16:50:16	nihilazo	I've generally found that the ios apps I've used have been like
2022-03-09 16:50:17	anton	I want to make a free software replacement for drafts so that it can work on non-apple systems
2022-03-09 16:50:17	nihilazo	actually nice
2022-03-09 16:50:27	elly	anton: then do it, man
2022-03-09 16:50:41	nihilazo	like, macos/ios UX seems to be legitimately good
2022-03-09 16:50:48	m455	yeah pushing a philosophy on a community that isn't focused around that philosophy can be really stressful anton
2022-03-09 16:50:49	elly	trying to turn the discussion into a phony question about what to *name* an app that doesn't yet exist, entirely because of not liking Drafts, is counterproductive :P
2022-03-09 16:50:57	elly	go write your thing
2022-03-09 16:51:12	@natalia	one thing i think is interesting is that open source distribution (or proper free licensing for any definition of free) seems to not actually hurt sales on ios
2022-03-09 16:51:25	@natalia	maybe it's different on desktop platforms but like there are so few people who care to build your app themselves
2022-03-09 16:51:35	elly	mac and ios both have decent populations of users who are willing to still pay you even if your app is free, I think
2022-03-09 16:51:36	extratone	I mean... I think I came up with the perfect name earlier today. https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/dwafts.png
2022-03-09 16:51:45	elly	because they like and are aware of the whole independent-software-maker idea
2022-03-09 16:51:58	elly	there's an app I used for yeeeears on macOS called Dash that was in that boat
2022-03-09 16:51:59	@natalia	yeah
2022-03-09 16:52:08	nihilazo	I would love if you could have like, old macos but still supported
2022-03-09 16:52:15	nihilazo	like, older os x, not like classic mac
2022-03-09 16:52:16	elly	https://kapeli.com/dash
2022-03-09 16:52:20	nihilazo	because performance got worse over time
2022-03-09 16:52:22	elly	this one, *super* great tool
2022-03-09 16:52:56	@natalia	from my understanding for a lot of professionals the whole "pay for something that's actually maintained and for which interaction with the developers is not super painful" is why people actually use ios for real stuff
2022-03-09 16:53:16	m455	elly: OU OU yes!! dash! i use a similar tool called zeal!
2022-03-09 16:53:26	m455	elly: dash lets you view it in the browser offline right?
2022-03-09 16:53:27	nihilazo	I'm happy to pay for software if it's good
2022-03-09 16:53:29	elly	can confirm, I would extremely happily pay someone money for their software to a) support them making it and b) have some sort of access to them for questions/feedback/etc
2022-03-09 16:53:30	@natalia	and yeah, tbh if i had to use an ipad to do real work on id be happier than an android tablet too
2022-03-09 16:53:33	nihilazo	I pay for renoise because it's good
2022-03-09 16:53:34	@natalia	elly: oooh dash is great
2022-03-09 16:53:37	elly	m455: yeah, it does
2022-03-09 16:53:45	elly	but also it just collects a ton of different doc sources
2022-03-09 16:53:49	nihilazo	like, I'm happy to pay for renoise because it's actually far better than any of the open source offerings in the same area
2022-03-09 16:53:50	m455	elly: that's awesome!
2022-03-09 16:53:55	@natalia	i don't use it but when i was really young a mentor told me to use it (and didn't realize it didn't work on Windows, which i used at the time. but!)
2022-03-09 16:53:58	elly	it's so good, strong rec if you are often skimming multiple docs
2022-03-09 16:54:01	@natalia	it was really impressive to me
2022-03-09 16:54:08	elly	yeah, it is mac only sadly
2022-03-09 16:54:09	@natalia	zeal is imo a bit more janky but i love the idea
2022-03-09 16:54:14	elly	it heavily depends on Cocoa
2022-03-09 16:54:16	m455	natalia: ahaha it's so janky
2022-03-09 16:54:30	extratone	Greg built two functions I didn't even explicitly request (I asked how hard it'd be to implement them) in a single weekend so.
2022-03-09 16:54:40	elly	:pray:
2022-03-09 16:54:49	extratone	which actually started to concern me, tbh.
2022-03-09 16:54:50	elly	the thing with serving a small audience is that you can serve them *super* well
2022-03-09 16:55:23	@natalia	honestly id be thrilled if someone who paid me asked me nicely to write silly software features
2022-03-09 16:55:39	m455	that would be sick
2022-03-09 16:55:43	@natalia	thats like the dream dude
2022-03-09 16:55:45	nihilazo	yeah
2022-03-09 16:55:45	m455	hell yeah
2022-03-09 16:56:18	m455	hello, yes. i would like one setting added to the logo of this software that lets me change to a picture of doge
2022-03-09 16:56:20	extratone	and that's why I say I should be paying more.
2022-03-09 16:56:35	m455	wow i worded that horribly
2022-03-09 16:56:47	extratone	I mean, he made a zalgo action for me on a sunday morning, which is basically the equivalent.
2022-03-09 16:56:52	elly	lol
2022-03-09 16:56:54	nihilazo	:D nice
2022-03-09 16:56:59	elly	well, you could probably be like "hey can I mail you more money"
2022-03-09 16:57:00	@natalia	m455: my friend just adds every icon submission to their app
2022-03-09 16:57:04	elly	I doubt they would say no?
2022-03-09 16:57:08	m455	natalia: hahahah hell yes!!!
2022-03-09 16:57:09	@natalia	that's under a certain size
2022-03-09 16:57:16	@natalia	there are some.. like. i mean they're not all great
2022-03-09 16:57:33	extratone	I'll wait until the next email chain about iPhone hardware keyboarding support.
2022-03-09 16:57:45	nihilazo	I want to go make some patches for my jacket but I am also not really feeling much creative energy
2022-03-09 16:57:56	nihilazo	even though making patches is just mixing some colors and painting pride flags on fabric
2022-03-09 16:58:04	extratone	I legit think the only reason he's so patient with me is because he doesn't realize I'm the same person that's been bothering him intermittently for my whole adult life.
2022-03-09 16:58:10	nihilazo	lol
2022-03-09 16:58:11	juspib	and once again
2022-03-09 16:58:11	@natalia	https://github.com/ish-app/ish/blob/master/app/Icons/freeiosterminal.png
2022-03-09 16:58:39	nihilazo	if I were to get a smartphone I think I'd get an ios device
2022-03-09 16:59:04	nihilazo	there's just so many nice apps
2022-03-09 16:59:07	nihilazo	especially for music
2022-03-09 16:59:12	extratone	you can have mine for a pinephone
2022-03-09 16:59:18	elly	I am really ambivalent about even having a smartphone any more
2022-03-09 16:59:25	nihilazo	I don't have a pinephone and you don't want a pinephone :P
2022-03-09 16:59:26	elly	or, I guess I should say, I wish they were less useful
2022-03-09 16:59:37	@natalia	i really want an n900 or smth but they only use 3g :(
2022-03-09 16:59:49	nihilazo	I don't have a smartphone, although my mp3 player dying has kinda made me think "what if all these other devices I have that keep breaking were one device"
2022-03-09 16:59:57	nihilazo	but then I realise "well, that device would be even easier to break"
2022-03-09 17:00:42	<--	juspib (juspib@localhost) has quit (Quit: cancer)
2022-03-09 17:00:48	@natalia	anyway talk later yall
2022-03-09 17:00:52	nihilazo	cya
2022-03-09 17:00:56	extratone	o/
2022-03-09 17:01:17	nihilazo	I'm annoyed rn by a few things. The first one is my dad's soldering iron, the second one is electronics stores
2022-03-09 17:01:28	nihilazo	like component stores
2022-03-09 17:01:38	extratone	you have them???
2022-03-09 17:01:42	nihilazo	online, yeah
2022-03-09 17:01:47	extratone	oh.
2022-03-09 17:01:47	nihilazo	like rs components etc. suppliers
2022-03-09 17:01:52	nihilazo	yeah we don't have irl ones
2022-03-09 17:01:58	extratone	I was gonna say.
2022-03-09 17:01:59	nihilazo	we have one kinda but they just ship stuff in from rs
2022-03-09 17:02:32	flowercorpse	there is one (1) in london!
2022-03-09 17:02:36	nihilazo	anyway, they are letting me buy buttons in a minimum packet of 20 and they want £5 shipping for a £3 item
2022-03-09 17:02:46	nihilazo	for my mp3 player repairs
2022-03-09 17:03:01	nihilazo	my dad's soldering iron is annoying me by being very unclear what tips are compatible with it
2022-03-09 17:03:21	nihilazo	except yihua ones (it's a yihua iron, cheapo thing), which are terrible
2022-03-09 17:03:37	nihilazo	and I'm thinking that I kinda want to get my own anyway because it'll be useful to have one, but idk what are good
2022-03-09 17:03:46	extratone	(can't help thinking all of this would be solved by a family-run hardware electronics store you could walk in.)

2022-03-09 17:04:46	nihilazo	dad's soldering iron is from a company called WEP who as far as I know don't exist
2022-03-09 17:04:52	extratone	Jeff Hell has definitively wrecked what locally-owned shops there were in my town and I hate it.
2022-03-09 17:04:54	nihilazo	it's a yihua soldering station
2022-03-09 17:05:04	nihilazo	and yihua tips are what it came with and suck
2022-03-09 17:05:17	nihilazo	and I'm pretty sure it's a clone of something, but I don't know what, so I don't know what better replacements i can get

2022-03-09 17:15:16	elly	I have been working my way through this (very long) quotes page and just accumulating more stuff to read: http://worrydream.com/#!/quotes
2022-03-09 17:15:21	elly	quotes pages are incredible for discovering new stuff
2022-03-09 17:15:43	kirch	same for fortune files....
2022-03-09 17:15:48	elly	yeah :)
2022-03-09 17:15:55	elly	my quotes page is actually formatted as a fortune file
2022-03-09 17:16:38	@natalia	haha i love that quote re: lua
2022-03-09 17:16:49	elly	there are several lua quotes on this page and they are all good
2022-03-09 17:17:06	elly	this one: "Business demanding promise from [open-source] project is like business demanding promise from forest. If you like trees, you must do other thing to conserve."
2022-03-09 17:17:28	elly	and the longer quote below starting "A language is an interface between programmers and hardware"
2022-03-09 17:17:53	@natalia	ah the quote i was thinking of was from luiz re: continue
2022-03-09 17:20:09	elly	I really like lua philosophically
2022-03-09 17:20:33	@natalia	huh--i was actually thinking about asking and/or searching on the mailing list about unicode identifiers (what'd break if they were implemented, omstly) and they are acutally there now, just as a compiler flag that's undocumented
2022-03-09 17:20:35	@natalia	elly: me too
2022-03-09 17:21:04	@natalia	i was talking to partner about it earlier and they said "i really hate that all of my problems with lua are minor" and like, same
2022-03-09 17:21:17	elly	haha
2022-03-09 17:21:23	@natalia	i get a little bit annoyed but it's such a good language and it's honestly unparalleled still
2022-03-09 17:22:22	@natalia	HAHA i'm reading thru the mailing list and
2022-03-09 17:22:25	@natalia	"It was thus said that the Great Viacheslav Usov once stated:"
2022-03-09 17:22:37	@natalia	i *have* to make my email client start quoting like that
2022-03-09 17:22:58	elly	Verily, it was written of old by ...:
2022-03-09 17:23:02	elly	you could probably come up with a bunch of them
2022-03-09 17:24:12	@natalia	quoth the previous message,
2022-03-09 17:25:49	elly	also there are a couple of quotes from The Emperor's Old Clothes here
2022-03-09 17:26:04	elly	which I constantly find myself recommending to people at work
2022-03-09 17:26:13	elly	esp: "At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse, but I soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination."
2022-03-09 17:26:26	@natalia	sounds familiar but i haven't read it
2022-03-09 17:26:43	@natalia	what is it?
2022-03-09 17:26:47	elly	it's a C. A. R. Hoare thing from 1980 about ALGOL 68 standardization
2022-03-09 17:26:56	elly	it's *highly* interesting if you work on large software projects or want to
2022-03-09 17:28:40	@natalia	aha
2022-03-09 17:50:27	m455	lol cool i just read through some of the lua quotes from that page too after you two were talking about it
2022-03-09 17:50:40	m455	are you doing more lua fiddling than fennel lately, natalia?
2022-03-09 17:50:44	@natalia	m455: yeah
2022-03-09 17:50:52	m455	sick!
2022-03-09 17:51:03	m455	it's nice to cut out one more little dependency to be honest lol
2022-03-09 17:51:19	@natalia	tbh, i don't know how much i like fennel's design features
2022-03-09 17:51:19	m455	i always think about that when using fennel lol, like "what if i just finally get around to learning lua"
2022-03-09 17:51:22	@natalia	i like *macros*
2022-03-09 17:51:37	@natalia	and pattern matching is i suppose really good :P
2022-03-09 17:51:41	@natalia	or could be
2022-03-09 17:51:48	m455	natalia: that's totally reasonable! i find myself wrapping stuff around shell commands in fennel a lot
2022-03-09 17:51:56	@natalia	but frankly the thing i dislike is that despite being pretty small it's hard to tell what fennel actually does
2022-03-09 17:52:03	@natalia	there's a lot of like, IIFE that just sort of happens
2022-03-09 17:52:06	m455	haha yeah i really like, well, i only know how to basic stuff, but yeah i like match lol and abuse it too much in fennel
2022-03-09 17:53:11	m455	natalia: i just searched that IIFE thing up. i could see that being annoying if you are trying to define a table that returns a function or something (though i probably dont understand it haha)
2022-03-09 17:53:18	@natalia	that's not what it is really
2022-03-09 17:53:22	m455	ahh okay xD
2022-03-09 17:53:49	m455	(i also have this problem in scheme but im sure that's what lambdas or quoting can fix lol but that's another conversation lol)
2022-03-09 17:54:59	@natalia	(< a (b) c) has to do iife iirc
2022-03-09 17:55:02	@natalia	or maybe not
2022-03-09 17:57:46	@natalia	i guess iy just has a heavier load than lua but no static analysis to help it
2022-03-09 18:00:25	@natalia	really, i only stopped using fennel for this project bevause lisp is hard with ed lmao
2022-03-09 18:00:42	elly	what *is* fennel?
2022-03-09 18:00:54	the_default	lisp that compiles to lua
2022-03-09 18:01:01	elly	O_o intriguing
2022-03-09 18:01:14	m455	natalia: hahaha that's fine. good to know!
2022-03-09 18:01:20	m455	elly: without overhead apparently!
2022-03-09 18:01:29	elly	that's cool but I will pay overhead for Lisp
2022-03-09 18:01:30	m455	and full interop :D
2022-03-09 18:01:35	m455	elly: hahaha
2022-03-09 18:01:39	m455	understandable :D
2022-03-09 18:01:50	elly	the main struggle I have with using Lisp is that the library situation is usually pretty dire and stuff like "make an https connection" requires considerable work
2022-03-09 18:01:51	m455	you can use any lua library with fennel, it's nice
2022-03-09 18:01:59	m455	oh good timing on my reply lol
2022-03-09 18:01:59	@natalia	despitr my complaints fennel is Really good
2022-03-09 18:02:11	elly	I'm deeply intrigued
2022-03-09 18:02:12	@natalia	i would recommend it
2022-03-09 18:02:24	@natalia	the maintainers are very nice
2022-03-09 18:02:26	elly	alright, that can be today's study material :)
2022-03-09 18:02:39	m455	oh yeah i can vouche for that!
2022-03-09 18:03:10	m455	elly: like i can have a .lua library like here: https://git.m455.casa/get-out/tree/src/lib and call it like this (line 1): https://git.m455.casa/get-out/tree/src/utils.fnl
2022-03-09 18:03:24	m455	i'm sure you know all about interop stuff, so dont mind my excitement over it lol
2022-03-09 18:03:24	@natalia	https://git.equa.space/emoji-regex/tree/make-regex.fnl some (bad) example code
2022-03-09 18:03:40	m455	natalia: you're making me wanna checkout lua though haha thanks
2022-03-09 18:03:48	@natalia	it doesn't provide a real standard library, but it has really useful set of macros
2022-03-09 18:04:02	@natalia	the most important ones are "icollect" and "accumulate" which are sort of map and fold, but for lua's iterators
2022-03-09 18:04:06	m455	i figure i should send out the link lol: https://fennel-lang.org/
2022-03-09 18:04:32	elly	hm, no debian package for fennel apparnetly
2022-03-09 18:04:49	@natalia	i think someone was working on it; there's some bootstrapping issues or smth
2022-03-09 18:04:54	@natalia	but it's a single file :)
2022-03-09 18:04:58	elly	yeah, I am not too worried about it
2022-03-09 18:05:43	@natalia	one thing i do like about fennel is it's smart about scope
2022-03-09 18:05:49	@natalia	the worst lua thing, imo, is automatic globals
2022-03-09 18:05:57	m455	elly: yeah you can download a binary or a single lua file/script
2022-03-09 18:06:05	elly	$ fennel
2022-03-09 18:06:05	elly	Welcome to Fennel 1.0.0 on Lua 5.4!
2022-03-09 18:06:07	elly	well that was easy
2022-03-09 18:06:11	elly	I'll check it out after work :)
2022-03-09 18:06:14	m455	yay!
2022-03-09 18:07:49	dzwdz	ugh, i just fell asleep for 2.5h
2022-03-09 18:08:15	@natalia	my other favorite fennel features: unicode identifiers and a good repl
2022-03-09 18:09:42	elly	yay unicode identifiers
2022-03-09 18:09:46	elly	that's a thing I like a lot about racket too
2022-03-09 18:10:18	@natalia	racket was my goto before i started messing with fennel
2022-03-09 18:10:27	dzwdz	ending function names in `?` <3
2022-03-09 18:10:31	m455	natalia: same haha
2022-03-09 18:10:33	dzwdz	unless it doesn't allow that
2022-03-09 18:10:40	elly	racket allows this: (λ (x) (+ x 1))
2022-03-09 18:10:47	elly	as a synonym for (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
2022-03-09 18:10:49	@natalia	racket is *really cool* but i have like...
2022-03-09 18:10:52	@natalia	oh fennel lets u do that too
2022-03-09 18:11:00	m455	oh neat so a unicode identifier (i just looked them up lol) is being able to define things using unicode stuff instead of just letters and whatever latin stuff
2022-03-09 18:11:02	@natalia	hey this is barely related but have you seen Raku's unicode support
2022-03-09 18:11:06	elly	m455: yeah
2022-03-09 18:11:19	m455	elly: cool thanks for the confirmation!
2022-03-09 18:11:54	elly	(C++ does this too, it's not exactly an arcane feature these days, but a lot of smaller languages don't bother with it)
2022-03-09 18:12:19	@natalia	hmm. how should unicode identifiers deal with bidirectional text?
2022-03-09 18:12:37	dzwdz	why do languages don't support it in the first place?
2022-03-09 18:12:46	dzwdz	do the parsers just not support unicode at all?
2022-03-09 18:12:48	elly	they don't want to depend on a unicode library
2022-03-09 18:12:54	elly	is usually the reason
2022-03-09 18:13:02	dzwdz	aight, that's a fair reason
2022-03-09 18:13:11	@natalia	like, do we need to special case bidi things to make it so you can nicely format code? or should that be The Job Of The Editor (TM)? or does it just sort of work?
2022-03-09 18:13:18	@natalia	(was thinking abt this because of ed earlier tbh)
2022-03-09 18:13:18	elly	natalia: leave it to the editor imo
2022-03-09 18:13:35	elly	you could also forbid bidi in identifiers I guess
2022-03-09 18:13:41	elly	since special chars are often forbidden in identifiers
2022-03-09 18:13:51	dzwdz	(which sucks)
2022-03-09 18:14:07	elly	well, sorta
2022-03-09 18:14:29	@natalia	the worry is sort of like, maybe numerals or something in identifiers displaying wrong
2022-03-09 18:14:35	elly	stuff like ? and ! should be allowed in identifiers, but imagine allowing ( or something
2022-03-09 18:14:40	elly	the parsing rapidly becomes pretty grotesque

2022-03-09 18:18:47	dzwdz	the Tor network
2022-03-09 18:18:52	@natalia	maybe a cool editor would have something like isolates
2022-03-09 18:19:01	@natalia	like, based on syntax
2022-03-09 18:19:01	elly	isolates?
2022-03-09 18:19:13	dzwdz	oh and also "Additional domains used to enable parts of site functionality", that's another good browser
2022-03-09 18:19:36	elly	I had no idea Twitter had an official Tor endpoint at all
2022-03-09 18:19:36	tomasino	everyone excited for twitter over tor?
2022-03-09 18:19:43	tomasino	ahh, you're talking about it now. yay
2022-03-09 18:19:45	tomasino	haha
2022-03-09 18:19:48	atomicdisintegrator	Not me.
2022-03-09 18:19:53	tomasino	it just launched like yesterday
2022-03-09 18:20:01	dzwdz	imo it's pretty pointless
2022-03-09 18:20:08	@natalia	elly: it signifies a piece of text is separate from its surroundings
2022-03-09 18:20:20	atomicdisintegrator	I prefer to abandon corporate platforms.
2022-03-09 18:20:21	dzwdz	you still have to log in, soo
2022-03-09 18:20:24	dzwdz	atomicdisintegrator: ^
2022-03-09 18:20:31	elly	it is not intended to keep you anonymous from Twitter
2022-03-09 18:20:33	tomasino	you're not hiding your identify  from twitter
2022-03-09 18:20:33	@natalia	i am worried about, say, like a lisp with arabic text with parentheses around them
2022-03-09 18:20:42	elly	it is intended to obscure that you, as a person in Russia or some other country, are using Twitter
2022-03-09 18:20:47	tomasino	^ exactly
2022-03-09 18:20:50	dzwdz	i'm already using tor though
2022-03-09 18:20:50	elly	from your government-run ISP
2022-03-09 18:21:01	@natalia	i don't understand the rules quite, but i'm thinking the parentheses might attach to the wrong directions sometimes
2022-03-09 18:21:04	dzwdz	it doesn't really do anything except making the connection slower
2022-03-09 18:21:08	elly	natalia: hmm
2022-03-09 18:21:10	dzwdz	well and maybe preventing sslstrip
2022-03-09 18:21:12	dzwdz	but cmon
2022-03-09 18:21:16	atomicdisintegrator	Sadly, there aren't many rural networks around.
2022-03-09 18:21:44	elly	natalia: tbh thinking about editing code that changes text direction, and trying to account for stuff like locale-specific quote conventions, hurts my head
2022-03-09 18:22:20	@natalia	haha same for real
2022-03-09 18:22:31	dzwdz	i mean, it's going to get people to know about tor
2022-03-09 18:22:33	dzwdz	which is cool

2022-03-09 18:24:06	atomicdisintegrator	Rather than "cool" I'd say "necessary" as many people don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.
2022-03-09 18:24:26	dzwdz	get to know != educate
2022-03-09 18:25:22	atomicdisintegrator	Yes, but education can be the side effect of information.
2022-03-09 18:25:35	dzwdz	true

2022-03-09 18:26:20	atomicdisintegrator	If I was let to be ignorant like school taught me I will probably ignore the free software, tor, tilde.town, the gopher and whatever is not "trendy".
2022-03-09 18:27:11	atomicdisintegrator	I've read an interesting phile on how schools are designing more criminals than specialized professionals and that's pretty disturbing.
2022-03-09 18:29:19	dzwdz	i wonder if this will cause a visible bump in the amount of tor users
2022-03-09 18:30:50	atomicdisintegrator	The tor network needs more nodes so the proportion of fedz nodes will probably drop.
2022-03-09 18:31:24	atomicdisintegrator	But generally, I hope people starts to distrust their beloved tech and learn how to make their own way on the net.
2022-03-09 18:31:53	dzwdz	the feds have netflow data anyways, so
2022-03-09 18:31:58	elly	I do not think Twitter is going to be the agent of that change :P
2022-03-09 18:32:05	dzwdz	at this point they don't even need to run their nodes

2022-03-09 18:32:44	atomicdisintegrator	So, are you giving up because of that?
2022-03-09 18:33:19	dzwdz	giving up on?
2022-03-09 18:33:37	atomicdisintegrator	Using tor for example.
2022-03-09 18:33:48	dzwdz	i'm not worried about feds
2022-03-09 18:33:51	dzwdz	i'm not planning a coup
2022-03-09 18:35:02	dzwdz	not on this connection, at least
2022-03-09 18:35:11	atomicdisintegrator	Without evidences you can't be put under surveillance at least by "legally" speaking.
2022-03-09 18:35:23	dzwdz	i don't think that's true anymore?
2022-03-09 18:36:37	elly	a big part of the controversy in the snowden leaks was that it came out that the various government agencies had been doing an end-run around that
2022-03-09 18:36:47	elly	by having the british government surveil americans and vice versa, and then sharing the results
2022-03-09 18:36:56	elly	so they were *technically* not doing domestic surveillance, but in effect were
2022-03-09 18:37:42	elly	no idea if they still are or not
2022-03-09 18:37:49	atomicdisintegrator	So? What do you think about it?
2022-03-09 18:37:54	dzwdz	why was that controversial? it doesn't change anything
2022-03-09 18:38:17	elly	because they appeared to be circumventing the laws that prevent them from doing that
2022-03-09 18:38:21	elly	that's why it was controversial

2022-03-09 20:07:29	extratone	does anybody know how to hide/adjust the timestamp (left) bar in weechat. I see settings for literally every element but that.
2022-03-09 20:08:29	dzwdz	the setting in the config file seems to be called bare_display_time_format
2022-03-09 20:08:36	dzwdz	but i have no idea how to find the /set name
2022-03-09 20:09:25	extratone	this is what my dilemma looks like. https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/novelchat.png
2022-03-09 20:09:50	extratone	ah well thank you dzwdz I'll dig a bit.
2022-03-09 20:11:33	bx	extratone: i did it before but ive forgotten
2022-03-09 20:11:38	m455	 /set weechat.look.buffer_time_format "%H:%M"
2022-03-09 20:11:55	m455	 /fset is a really handy command for finding settings
2022-03-09 20:12:10	dzwdz	doesn't beat grep in programs with normal dotfiles :shrug:
2022-03-09 20:13:30	extratone	well that definitely helped, thank you m455. maybe one day I'll figure out how to wrap the nicknames by character instead of word
2022-03-09 20:13:52	@natalia	there's a max length config
2022-03-09 20:14:16	m455	to change nick length stuff: /set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 11
2022-03-09 20:15:03	@natalia	that's what it is, thanks
2022-03-09 20:15:06	@natalia	i couldn't remember it
2022-03-09 20:15:18	@natalia	frantically searching thru user guide and found what i'd been looking for yesterday
2022-03-09 20:15:46	m455	haha yeah i ahve a text file of how to do everything i spent a lot of time tryign to figure out weechat-wise
2022-03-09 20:16:56	dzwdz	it isn't possible to set sotd to a specific part of a song, right?
2022-03-09 20:17:00	extratone	that's a good idea... you all have saved my life. I'm actually looking at a reasonably readable chat window now lol
2022-03-09 20:18:43	elly	I think sotd is just an arbitrary string?

2022-03-09 20:28:15	elly	the older a message is the more corrupt it gets until it fades out

2022-03-10 03:45:15	elly	hello hello
2022-03-10 03:48:19	@natalia	hi elly
2022-03-10 03:48:37	elly	hey natalia :) how's your evening?
2022-03-10 03:49:34	@natalia	elly: i just got off work! listening to some music, trying to figure out what to do with myself
2022-03-10 03:49:46	@natalia	i'd normally wind down for sleeping but i have a pretty sizable chunk of energy
2022-03-10 03:49:54	@natalia	might review + commit the changes i made to the ed irc bot today
2022-03-10 03:49:58	@natalia	how about yours?
2022-03-10 03:50:20	elly	well, at the moment really tired :)
2022-03-10 03:50:33	elly	I wrote a functional fennel program though, so that's good
2022-03-10 03:50:45	@natalia	aha!
2022-03-10 03:50:49	@natalia	how did you like it?
2022-03-10 03:50:57	elly	mostly a lot :)
2022-03-10 03:51:02	elly	the method call syntax is very un-lispy
2022-03-10 03:51:47	elly	but it has much that appeals to me
2022-03-10 03:52:11	@natalia	hm. do you mean the a:b thing or just calling in general?
2022-03-10 03:52:18	elly	the a:b thing specifically
2022-03-10 03:52:28	elly	a:b is a single token in lisp grammars usually
2022-03-10 03:52:36	elly	but in fennel it's 3 - object, ':', method
2022-03-10 03:52:38	@natalia	yeah, understandable
2022-03-10 03:52:44	@natalia	what about the regular a.b stuff
2022-03-10 03:52:48	@natalia	i'm.. conflicted frequently
2022-03-10 03:52:55	elly	that part feels less weird to me
2022-03-10 03:53:09	@natalia	interesting, and reasonable
2022-03-10 03:53:18	@natalia	frankly lua's method calls just aren't as useful
2022-03-10 03:53:26	@natalia	in lua you can do like, call(thing):blah()
2022-03-10 03:53:28	elly	I don't have deep principled thoughts about it and I generally don't like OO programming regardless
2022-03-10 03:53:32	elly	yeah
2022-03-10 03:53:36	@natalia	also, agreed

2022-03-10 03:54:23	@natalia	in which i think stuff like `a.b` would only be used for like, static namespacing
2022-03-10 03:54:39	@natalia	because i think that is one way which is much better than traditional lisp single-namespace stuff

2022-03-10 03:59:04	elly	heh, yeah :)
2022-03-10 04:08:43	elly	I am trying to understand how icollect works

2022-03-10 04:09:54	elly	aha, got it
2022-03-10 04:10:18	@natalia	(andonce you get that collect is the same thing but you give it a kv pair instead of just a value)

2022-03-10 04:58:45	asm	:c
2022-03-10 05:04:53	@natalia	i feel like i learned more from hacking on it and talking there
2022-03-10 05:05:14	@natalia	the weird thing about it is that its goals being almost transparently mirroring lua semantics is that you learn a lot more from the weird edge cases you can't actually see
2022-03-10 05:05:40	@natalia	there is some value i think to something that is actually not any more beautiful or intricate, just slightly better
2022-03-10 05:09:31	dozens	elly: i adore fennel
2022-03-10 05:09:44	dozens	and the logo was drawn by our own m455
2022-03-10 05:10:07	dozens	i think i love fennel mostly because i love lua
2022-03-10 05:10:43	dozens	and lua is so universal as a scripting and configuration language, it's easy to write fennel in a ton of places
2022-03-10 05:12:03	dozens	but i kind of agree with natalia (i think) in that probably the number one thing fennel did for me is teach me a lot about lua. data structures and concurrency, etc.
2022-03-10 05:12:09	@natalia	wait, m455 drew the logo!?
2022-03-10 05:12:16	dozens	i think so!!
2022-03-10 05:12:26	m455	haha yeah
2022-03-10 05:12:34	m455	i did it in inkscape one night when iw as bored lol
2022-03-10 05:12:39	m455	it was like my first inkscape drawing LOL
2022-03-10 05:12:50	dozens	fucking famous
2022-03-10 05:12:53	m455	i'm hoping someone who actually knows art can make a cuter one lol i tried ot make it cute af
2022-03-10 05:13:12	elly	it is!
2022-03-10 05:13:12	dozens	i mean, it's about as adorable as can be
2022-03-10 05:13:46	m455	hahaha
2022-03-10 05:13:51	dozens	i always thought fennel was named after the fox until the veggie logo showed up
2022-03-10 05:14:01	dozens	wait
2022-03-10 05:14:04	dozens	fennec fox?
2022-03-10 05:14:06	m455	hahaha
2022-03-10 05:14:07	dozens	fuck
2022-03-10 05:14:08	@natalia	m455: the drawing looks great <3
2022-03-10 05:14:26	m455	hahah thanks, i wanted the top green things to be more vegetable like but arcs in inkscape are hard LOL
2022-03-10 05:14:39	m455	i'm very happy about the gradients i did though!
2022-03-10 05:14:44	elly	I'm definitely going to keep learning it
2022-03-10 05:14:55	elly	I don't really know a good prototyping / scripting language right now
2022-03-10 05:15:33	dozens	the guy who initially wrote fennel is the same guy who wrote julia
2022-03-10 05:15:39	dozens	people really like julia
2022-03-10 05:15:47	m455	janet!
2022-03-10 05:15:49	m455	haha

2022-03-10 05:16:03	dozens	julia is a nice name too

2022-03-10 05:18:12	dozens	elly: yeah that's the one. i see posts on lobsters and hackernews from people who are really into it.
2022-03-10 05:18:20	dozens	haven't tried it myself, so i can't say
2022-03-10 05:19:03	elly	today I also learned of: https://github.com/jedisct1/libhydrogen/

2022-03-10 14:01:14	extratone	the old Tweetbot logo is DEFINITELY screaming. https://tilde.town/~extratone/icons/Tweetbot3.png
2022-03-10 14:01:18	extratone	o/ m455
2022-03-10 14:01:37	m455	how's it going extratone?
2022-03-10 14:02:18	extratone	I'm still alive. reminiscing a bit on the very first iPhone IRC apps for this thing I'm writing.
2022-03-10 14:02:23	extratone	how about you?
2022-03-10 14:10:12	m455	cool haha sounds like a fun thing to reminisce about. i'm not doing too bad, just starting my workday and waking up with some coffee after having some peanut butter toast
2022-03-10 14:10:13	m455	!!breakfast
2022-03-10 14:10:27	m455	oh damn tracer is done from the restart haha
2022-03-10 14:17:04	extratone	that sounds tasty.
2022-03-10 14:17:21	m455	ahah yeah it was
2022-03-10 14:22:25	extratone	https://ttm.sh/ioM.jpeg
2022-03-10 14:24:00	tomasino	there it is
2022-03-10 14:29:46	elly	morning :) happy Thursday
2022-03-10 14:30:15	extratone	howdy elly. it's almost actually snowing here.
2022-03-10 14:45:04	extratone	I need town to update to nano 6.2 I absolutely demand it .
2022-03-10 14:50:11	elly	what is new in nano 6.2?
2022-03-10 14:54:49	barnaba	    The file browser clears the prompt bar also when using --minibar.
2022-03-10 14:54:51	barnaba	    Linting now works also with a newer 'pyflakes'.
2022-03-10 14:55:06	barnaba	that's the entire changelog, no need to link, no need to pastebinit xd
2022-03-10 14:55:41	barnaba	but we're on 4.8, which is 2 years old now
2022-03-10 14:55:46	extratone	I'm sorry I was joking.
2022-03-10 14:57:22	barnaba	well it's my bad for only reading 0 lines of context
2022-03-10 14:57:58	elly	there was no context other than extratone asking us to upgrade to nano 6.2 :P
2022-03-10 14:58:01	extratone	idk about that. 
2022-03-10 14:58:12	extratone	yes
2022-03-10 14:58:39	dzwdz	i think i broke another computer today
2022-03-10 14:58:41	extratone	I know this is a crude way to say it but I think it's funny nano isn't... ya know... done?
2022-03-10 14:58:52	extratone	dzwdz cheers
2022-03-10 14:59:41	elly	the environment around software tends to change around it, even if the software itself doesn't
2022-03-10 14:59:47	elly	dzwdz: oh no
2022-03-10 14:59:59	dzwdz	in short
2022-03-10 15:00:32	dzwdz	it was already "broken" but it hasn't been looked at in a few years and i wanted to give it a shot
2022-03-10 15:00:41	dzwdz	the cpu cooling feel off
2022-03-10 15:01:12	dzwdz	i tried booting it like 2 days ago, it posted, but i had to turn it off to not fry it
2022-03-10 15:01:13	extratone	as in a reduction or as in fell off on to the floor
2022-03-10 15:01:32	dzwdz	feel down into the case
2022-03-10 15:01:46	dzwdz	so today a friend of mine helped me install the cooler back
2022-03-10 15:01:49	extratone	lol 
2022-03-10 15:01:59	dzwdz	and now it doesn't even post
2022-03-10 15:02:09	dzwdz	we also cleaned the psu which could be related
2022-03-10 15:16:08	barnaba	extratone: only way for nano to be done is replacing it with a symlink to vim imo
2022-03-10 15:16:20	dzwdz	they fill different niches
2022-03-10 15:16:21	barnaba	untill then there's work to do
2022-03-10 15:16:26	barnaba	well yeah
2022-03-10 15:16:37	barnaba	one is for text editing and the other is for me wishing I wasn't in nano
2022-03-10 15:17:15	barnaba	I mean I get what they meant to do, but for a simple editor it somehow is really hard for me to exit it
2022-03-10 15:17:35	dzwdz	pkill nano
2022-03-10 15:17:45	barnaba	actually I should do that
2022-03-10 15:17:47	barnaba	... in cron
2022-03-10 15:17:47	extratone	^x
2022-03-10 15:17:55	dzwdz	^x^
2022-03-10 15:17:58	dzwdz	^_^
2022-03-10 15:18:02	barnaba	^_^
2022-03-10 15:18:08	dzwdz	///_^
2022-03-10 15:18:31	extratone	I would use micro but when I paste it does this line by line animation that makes the whole thing absolutely untenable for editing town files on my phone lol
2022-03-10 15:18:47	dzwdz	ed works great on all terminals
2022-03-10 15:19:00	dzwdz	it's the most universal editor out there
2022-03-10 15:19:17	barnaba	do distros depend on it?
2022-03-10 15:19:22	extratone	so I've heard, dzwdz, and I know elly's guide is great, but edward and I aren't getting along right now.
2022-03-10 15:19:31	barnaba	cause some distros started removing some programs like cal from default installs
2022-03-10 15:19:32	dzwdz	shame
2022-03-10 15:19:35	dzwdz	he's a great guy
2022-03-10 15:19:41	dzwdz	just a bit shy
2022-03-10 15:19:45	barnaba	so if not I imagine ed will go away soon
2022-03-10 15:19:52	barnaba	gotta save 16 kB
2022-03-10 15:19:54	extratone	I suspect things will come back around when I get adderall again next week lol
2022-03-10 15:20:16	extratone	both the full manual and elly's guide are printed and waiting for me next to my desk at home lol
2022-03-10 15:20:28	barnaba	hah
2022-03-10 15:20:37	dzwdz	so i've been thinking
2022-03-10 15:20:40	dzwdz	sh and ed are pretty similar
2022-03-10 15:20:47	dzwdz	why not merge them into a single program
2022-03-10 15:20:49	extratone	SHED
2022-03-10 15:21:26	extratone	i just yelped and I'm in starbucks lol
2022-03-10 15:21:26	@natalia	hello
2022-03-10 15:21:31	barnaba	I was going to criticize the printing, but then we're on pubnix and IRCing, so maybe get it spiral bound too
2022-03-10 15:21:47	dzwdz	irc doesn't kill trees
2022-03-10 15:22:01	tomasino	well...
2022-03-10 15:22:04	barnaba	well
2022-03-10 15:22:09	barnaba	actaully
2022-03-10 15:22:16	extratone	I kill trees. I have actively poisoned trees. I have also shot a tree so many times with a gun it fell down.
2022-03-10 15:22:24	dzwdz	i actually pipe all logs to my printer
2022-03-10 15:22:50	extratone	I have also crashed tractors into far too many trees.
2022-03-10 15:22:52	barnaba	I kinda want a device just printing the #tildetown line by line as they are happening live
2022-03-10 15:22:53	tomasino	pinhook is powered by the souls of trees. every time someone invokes it another tree dies.
2022-03-10 15:22:54	elly	"it's called a tamper-evident log, loog it up"
2022-03-10 15:23:01	elly	look, rather
2022-03-10 15:23:10	extratone	belt loop receipt printer is my dream.
2022-03-10 15:23:23	tomasino	gemini stream of irc channel traffic!
2022-03-10 15:23:24	extratone	I will never speak again, just hand people slips of paper with "fuck you" 
2022-03-10 15:23:36	dzwdz	BLOCKCHAIN IRC
2022-03-10 15:23:49	dzwdz	with signed messages
2022-03-10 15:23:51	elly	extratone: you could do that without a printer hanging off your belt if you wanted to
2022-03-10 15:24:08	dzwdz	that's not as fun
2022-03-10 15:24:12	dzwdz	like look
2022-03-10 15:24:18	dzwdz	you could print it on the fly
2022-03-10 15:24:23	extratone	it needs to be hanging right where a gun holster would be.
2022-03-10 15:24:23	dzwdz	get their hopes up for something interesting
2022-03-10 15:24:38	extratone	I'm gonna steal one off a chickfila kid
2022-03-10 15:24:40	@natalia	i wonder what the cheapest device similar to a teletype you could create would be
2022-03-10 15:24:55	tomasino	thermal printer maybe?
2022-03-10 15:24:56	@natalia	i think it would not be that hard to get the endless irc paper log but you have to make it print lines as you're typing
2022-03-10 15:25:18	@natalia	so maybe an lcd or something
2022-03-10 15:25:40	dzwdz	a phone irc client
2022-03-10 15:25:46	dzwdz	which just TTSes all messages out the speaker
2022-03-10 15:25:52	dzwdz	and does voice recognition for input
2022-03-10 15:25:54	@natalia	hmmm
2022-03-10 15:25:56	extratone	"sorry I'm just getting a message from the chat" *over the sound of a deafening printer*
2022-03-10 15:25:58	dzwdz	you could just call it up
2022-03-10 15:26:27	dzwdz	555-TILDECHAT
2022-03-10 15:26:34	extratone	I could be doing that in blink right now dzwdz. there's a say command
2022-03-10 15:28:14	@natalia	modem sounds of vte control characters
2022-03-10 15:28:27	@natalia	anyways. man even the cool platforms have awful support systems huh
2022-03-10 15:28:47	@natalia	my friend got banned from itch.io for having the same ip as someone else previously and got a very annoying message about it
2022-03-10 15:29:00	dzwdz	...that's dumb
2022-03-10 15:29:02	extratone	I did it. https://ttm.sh/ioX.9852A51A
2022-03-10 15:29:39	m455	natalia: lol that's ridiculous god
2022-03-10 15:29:40	extratone	the young woman next to me really did turn her head for a sec on the third take
2022-03-10 15:29:48	dzwdz	what should the extension be
2022-03-10 15:30:02	extratone	.shed
2022-03-10 15:32:09	barnaba	natalia: it needs to be on printer paper with holes on the side though. And needs to be able to spit the log line by line, not by sheets
2022-03-10 15:32:29	dzwdz	oh natalia
2022-03-10 15:32:31	dzwdz	you're into ed, right?
2022-03-10 15:32:56	dzwdz	what would you think about combining sh and ed
2022-03-10 15:33:03	dzwdz	they're pretty similar if you think about it
2022-03-10 15:33:53	barnaba	we could call it edsh
2022-03-10 15:34:05	@natalia	dzwdz: ed and sh are already combined: ed has a ! command
2022-03-10 15:34:25	@natalia	likewise, you can combine ed into sh by running the "ed" command in your sh script
2022-03-10 15:34:32	dzwdz	oh god you're right
2022-03-10 15:35:06	dzwdz	it'd be nice if there was a way for the ! to be inserted automatically
2022-03-10 15:35:17	dzwdz	so the default is sh mode, and if you want to do ed stuff you need to backspace
2022-03-10 15:35:32	@natalia	that seems odd
2022-03-10 15:36:04	@natalia	like, i am unsure of the goal this is trying to accomplish
2022-03-10 15:36:07	elly	do !sh, use the shell as normal, then exit it when you want to go back into "ed mode" :P
2022-03-10 15:36:17	dzwdz	elly: that's not what i want
2022-03-10 15:36:27	dzwdz	i don't want sh and ed to be separate modes
2022-03-10 15:36:47	@natalia	what would it accomplish?
2022-03-10 15:37:11	dzwdz	nothing
2022-03-10 15:37:28	@natalia	what is an example of how you would use it
2022-03-10 15:37:29	dzwdz	terrifying people who look at my setup
2022-03-10 15:37:38	dzwdz	well i'd use it as my shell
2022-03-10 15:37:48	dzwdz	but instead of dropping into vim to edit files i'd directly use it for that
2022-03-10 15:38:09	dzwdz	great for memory constrained environments!
2022-03-10 15:38:22	elly	combine two smaller programs into one larger program :P
2022-03-10 15:39:04	dzwdz	that's what i'm doing here
2022-03-10 15:39:08	dzwdz	it also has a cool name, shed
2022-03-10 15:39:47	@natalia	i feel like i need a better vision of example usecase to see how they would combine
2022-03-10 15:40:01	@natalia	because so far i don't see the difference from just running ed
2022-03-10 15:40:17	dzwdz	the difference is that you're not running a separate thing
2022-03-10 15:40:19	elly	I'm pretty sure this entire idea is deliberate silliness and should not be interpreted too seriously
2022-03-10 15:40:37	dzwdz	also ! in ed doesn't support changing directories
2022-03-10 15:40:41	dzwdz	or pretty much any sh stuff
2022-03-10 15:41:33	@natalia	hmmm
2022-03-10 15:41:43	@natalia	do the semantics combine with each other?
2022-03-10 15:41:49	dzwdz	why not
2022-03-10 15:41:56	dzwdz	also i suppose that you could add fish-like line editing
2022-03-10 15:42:04	dzwdz	which could also be used in the ed part, somehow
2022-03-10 15:42:31	@natalia	sounds like the job for another program :triumph:
2022-03-10 15:43:59	dzwdz	fished
2022-03-10 15:44:38	@natalia	if you implemented ed successfully within sh there would probably be some interesting features
2022-03-10 15:45:44	dzwdz	hm
2022-03-10 15:45:47	dzwdz	see the thing is
2022-03-10 15:45:52	dzwdz	rather than making sh a better ed
2022-03-10 15:45:59	dzwdz	i'd rather make ed a better sh
2022-03-10 15:46:12	dzwdz	i'd rather expand on ed, and not on sh
2022-03-10 15:46:24	@natalia	hmm okay
2022-03-10 15:47:08	dzwdz	but i like that in theory you could use vanilla ed as a shell
2022-03-10 15:47:39	dzwdz	ex seems to be a terrible shell though
2022-03-10 15:48:52	 *	dzwdz is kinda tempted to submit a patch adding support for cd to ed
2022-03-10 15:48:56	dzwdz	and maybe setting variables too
2022-03-10 15:49:13	@natalia	*submit* a patch!?
2022-03-10 15:49:19	@natalia	:P
2022-03-10 15:49:21	dzwdz	yes
2022-03-10 15:49:33	dzwdz	or whatever the wording is
2022-03-10 15:49:39	dzwdz	like, it won't break anything
2022-03-10 15:50:12	@natalia	how would you implement it?
2022-03-10 15:50:21	dzwdz	badly
2022-03-10 15:50:29	@natalia	like, how would you cd from within ed
2022-03-10 15:50:53	dzwdz	ok let's take back the submitting part
2022-03-10 15:50:58	dzwdz	if i wanted to just make something for my own use
2022-03-10 15:51:06	dzwdz	i could make ! use sh internally
2022-03-10 15:51:25	dzwdz	everything after ! is sent to sh as input
2022-03-10 15:51:30	@natalia	mhm
2022-03-10 15:53:27	@natalia	would the shell be able to talk back?
2022-03-10 15:53:35	dzwdz	as in?
2022-03-10 15:53:44	dzwdz	hm, actually some state would need to be shared
2022-03-10 15:53:46	dzwdz	such as the prompt
2022-03-10 15:54:10	@natalia	should the shell be able to run ed commands, or do you not much care about that?
2022-03-10 15:54:23	dzwdz	that was kinda the original idea
2022-03-10 15:54:27	dzwdz	making ed commands shell builtins
2022-03-10 15:54:49	@natalia	yeah--that's why i mentioned implementing ed within sh earlier
2022-03-10 15:55:07	dzwdz	but i've realized that /bin/ed would be an useable shell already
2022-03-10 15:55:07	@natalia	one reason ed might like to run individual sh processes is that it can clearly tell where it ends
2022-03-10 15:55:11	dzwdz	and i like that idea much more
2022-03-10 15:55:42	@natalia	if you just pipe stuff to ed, you can't really tell what its result is
2022-03-10 16:00:45	dzwdz	it's nice to randomly see people using the mlm flag
2022-03-10 16:05:47	elly	ed does pass everything after ! to the shell
2022-03-10 16:05:57	elly	oh, you mean with a persistent shell session of some sort
2022-03-10 16:06:33	@natalia	there's not like, a huge reason you can't just make a persistent shell with a new command you made, but argument parsing might be unpleasant
2022-03-10 16:06:38	@natalia	for example, !s 'cat whatever'
2022-03-10 16:07:05	elly	you would want to avoid doing any argument parsing at all on the ed side
2022-03-10 16:07:10	@natalia	yeah
2022-03-10 16:07:14	elly	if the line starts with !, send the entire rest of it to the shell's stdin
2022-03-10 16:07:57	elly	. o O ( (a,b)! sends lines a through b of the buffer to the shell's stdin )
2022-03-10 16:08:01	@natalia	it's probably easier if you don't care about the possibility of lines mixing, you should be able to just start the process and then do some basic waiting on it
2022-03-10 16:10:18	@natalia	oh, i have a unix question by the way
2022-03-10 16:11:09	@natalia	so like, when i'm in shell, and i open a new process (like cat)
2022-03-10 16:11:36	@natalia	i can send ^D to it, and it closes the pipe to cat, but not to the actual process
2022-03-10 16:11:51	@natalia	the parent process, i mean
2022-03-10 16:12:09	@natalia	how does that, like, work? what's going on with the various pipes there
2022-03-10 16:12:18	@natalia	also if i do something like open a new shell, and then do 'sleep 1; exit'
2022-03-10 16:12:34	@natalia	and type a bunch of lines within that one second, those lines get buffered until the subshell closes
2022-03-10 16:12:44	@natalia	i am just confused as to what's going on on many levels
2022-03-10 16:13:39	elly	short version: it's complicated :)
2022-03-10 16:13:58	elly	long version: when the shell creates the cat child process, it makes a new file descriptor that refers to the same stdin as the shell had
2022-03-10 16:14:17	elly	cat will try to read from that new file descriptor, but the shell (instead of trying to do that) will just be waiting for cat
2022-03-10 16:14:33	elly	so when you hit ctrl-d, cat's read() call will return with an eof and cat will exit
2022-03-10 16:14:47	elly	then the shell's wait() will end and the shell will go back to trying to read() from stdin
2022-03-10 16:15:38	@natalia	okay, that makes sense so far
2022-03-10 16:15:44	extratone	shortest version: S̶ͦ͏̱͖͏̤͙͕̞͂ͮH̡̛͚͂͘͏͎E͆Ḑ̧̥́ͪ̉́ͥ̀
2022-03-10 16:15:46	@natalia	but if it's the same stdin, why does ^D only close one of them?
2022-03-10 16:16:08	elly	natalia: they are multiple file descriptors to the same stdin "device"
2022-03-10 16:16:12	elly	but the file descriptors are independent
2022-03-10 16:16:15	@natalia	ah hm
2022-03-10 16:16:27	elly	the stdin device itself is something called a "pty"
2022-03-10 16:16:54	@natalia	hmm
2022-03-10 16:17:45	@natalia	makes sense
2022-03-10 16:17:49	elly	as for why you see the behavior with sleep 1 and such: until someone read()s from a file descriptor that is connected to stdin, the kernel buffers input
2022-03-10 16:17:56	@natalia	what happens on the terminal side when i run ^D?
2022-03-10 16:18:04	@natalia	yeah, the buffering/sleeping part makes sense
2022-03-10 16:18:12	elly	nothing - it just passes the ^D through as EOF
2022-03-10 16:18:23	elly	the program at the other end can actually ignore it and keep reading if it wants to
2022-03-10 16:19:28	@natalia	how does it *pass* the ^D through? is that just write(0) or something? the only way i was able to envision the idea of passing eof was like, actually closing the file, which i guess is where my confusion came from
2022-03-10 16:21:28	elly	no - try running ~elly/t/test for example
2022-03-10 16:21:28	@natalia	huh, okay, i think i just learned how ^D works actually. i always wondered why i had to press it twice when i wnated to send a line without a newline and then eof
2022-03-10 16:21:33	@natalia	huh okay
2022-03-10 16:21:34	elly	the corresponding source is in ~elly/t/test.c
2022-03-10 16:21:41	-->	bub (bub@localhost) has joined #tildetown
2022-03-10 16:21:48	elly	if you hit ^D, you'll see it emits something like "0 00"
2022-03-10 16:21:58	elly	meaning, read() returned 0 (no more bytes in the file)
2022-03-10 16:22:00	@natalia	mhm
2022-03-10 16:22:09	elly	but that doesn't mean you actually *have* to stop reading
2022-03-10 16:22:13	@natalia	yeah okay
2022-03-10 16:22:15	@natalia	neat!
2022-03-10 16:22:57	@natalia	i am curious if i am correct about how ^D is actually sending the 0. like if i write(fd, NULL, 0) to a tty, will read return 0 on the other end?
2022-03-10 16:23:12	@natalia	s/sending the 0/making read return 0 instead of hanging
2022-03-10 16:23:13	sedbot	<natalia> i am curious if i am correct about how ^D is actually making read return 0 instead of hanging. like if i write(fd, NULL, 0) to a tty, will read return 0 on the other end?
2022-03-10 16:24:17	elly	no, write() of 0 bytes doesn't do anything
2022-03-10 16:24:30	elly	see ~elly/t/test.c, I modified it to use a pipe for more clarity
2022-03-10 16:24:54	elly	if you want to for some reason synthesize an EOF on a pipe or whatever, you can just close the write end
2022-03-10 16:25:01	@natalia	yeah but specifically on a pty
2022-03-10 16:25:23	elly	oh, that I am not as sure about
2022-03-10 16:25:33	elly	ptys have a lot of their own behavior that happens in the kernel-side driver
2022-03-10 16:25:47	@natalia	ah
2022-03-10 16:26:03	elly	so I don't actually know "how" the ^D turns into an eof
2022-03-10 16:26:15	@natalia	i see i see! i will have to do research
2022-03-10 16:27:11	@natalia	still i understand how ptys work much better now, thank you :)
2022-03-10 16:27:15	elly	no worries
2022-03-10 16:27:37	elly	this particular corner of unix userland is very filled with spiderwebs
2022-03-10 16:31:56	@natalia	hm, i mean--i guess the ^D character is sent *to* the pty device itself?
2022-03-10 16:32:04	@natalia	unless i am misunderstanding
2022-03-10 16:32:10	@natalia	so at that point it doesn't really matter how it's done
2022-03-10 16:32:19	elly	one sec
2022-03-10 16:33:38	elly	~elly/t/shell.trace is an strace of my shell running and me typing ^D into it
2022-03-10 16:34:07	@natalia	hmmm
2022-03-10 16:34:11	elly	you can see the shell doesn't actually ever "get" the ^D in the first place
2022-03-10 16:34:18	elly	the shell experiences it as stdin returning a 0-length read:
2022-03-10 16:34:21	elly	read(0, "", 8192)                       = 0
2022-03-10 16:34:24	@natalia	oh i know the shell doesn't get it, to be clear, sorry
2022-03-10 16:34:27	elly	ah yeah
2022-03-10 16:34:28	@natalia	i was trying to figure out if, um
2022-03-10 16:34:41	@natalia	er, "how" terminal emulator sends that eof
2022-03-10 16:34:44	elly	yeah, the terminal emulator ends up funnelling the ^D to the pty
2022-03-10 16:34:45	elly	hm
2022-03-10 16:34:46	elly	let's see
2022-03-10 16:34:56	@natalia	but yeah, it just sends the ^D to the pty, at least according to/as implied by pts(7)
2022-03-10 16:35:06	elly	regrettably, I cannot actually strace my own sshd
2022-03-10 16:35:11	elly	which is what is really talking to the pty
2022-03-10 16:35:19	@natalia	> For example, writing the interrupt character (usually control-C) to the master device
2022-03-10 16:35:32	@natalia	so it does jut pass along the character
2022-03-10 16:35:36	@natalia	that makes sense
2022-03-10 16:35:36	elly	that's kind of what I would have expected I guess
2022-03-10 16:35:46	elly	it may be illustrative to try to make a toy program that uses the pty interface
2022-03-10 16:35:54	@natalia	yeah, would be a fun project at some point
2022-03-10 16:36:19	@natalia	but my original question is now fully satisfied i think

2022-03-10 21:00:22	@natalia	(i had accidentally navigated myself onto an old revision it turns out was the actual issue)
2022-03-10 21:01:28	benharri	i remember talking to one of the maintainers about that
2022-03-10 21:01:37	benharri	back when it was called oragono
2022-03-10 21:02:05	@natalia	hard to remember the name used to be even worse
2022-03-10 21:02:14	@vilmibm	lol yes
2022-03-10 21:02:23	@vilmibm	i don't mind ergo because i spell it right every time
2022-03-10 21:02:32	@vilmibm	i mean oragono was cute but i kept mispelling
2022-03-10 21:03:33	 *	benharri waves at slingamn
2022-03-10 21:07:01	nihilazo	I give up
2022-03-10 21:07:05	nihilazo	I'm just gonna take the blow
2022-03-10 21:07:14	the_default	mp3 player?
2022-03-10 21:07:21	nihilazo	£10 for the privilage of attempting to repair something instead of throwing it out
2022-03-10 21:07:26	nihilazo	no, parts for mp3 player fixing
2022-03-10 21:07:34	nihilazo	but yeah
2022-03-10 21:07:46	the_default	ouch. what parts are you buying?
2022-03-10 21:07:51	@natalia	i should update town's ergo
2022-03-10 21:07:53	nihilazo	literally a microswitch
2022-03-10 21:07:54	nihilazo	that's it
2022-03-10 21:08:05	nihilazo	and a soldering iron tip
2022-03-10 21:08:10	the_default	uncontrolled capitalism <3
2022-03-10 21:08:14	nihilazo	they total like £8 and they want a £10 small orders fee
2022-03-10 21:08:32	nihilazo	unless I can find something they sell that would resell on ebay and resell it at cost
2022-03-10 21:08:54	nihilazo	like, buy a raspberry pi as well then sell it under RRP on ebay but still overall save money
2022-03-10 21:09:08	nihilazo	might be worth a shot
2022-03-10 21:09:18	nihilazo	it's riskier tho
2022-03-10 21:09:24	the_default	where are you buying from? i need electronics stuff
2022-03-10 21:09:49	the_default	(never mind shipping would also be expensive)
2022-03-10 21:10:23	nihilazo	"Available to manufacturer lead time of 372 days"
2022-03-10 21:10:27	nihilazo	the_default: farnell
2022-03-10 21:10:40	nihilazo	shipping will be cheaper if we pool together, I can ship it to you
2022-03-10 21:11:05	the_default	actually if i get solder and some pots it can ship in a large envelope
2022-03-10 21:11:08	nihilazo	they give free shipping on orders over £40 and shipping some parts isn't gonna cost more than the £10 they want in additional fees
2022-03-10 21:11:09	nihilazo	yeah
2022-03-10 21:13:12	nihilazo	I'm ordering £15 of stuff so if you are ordering £25 or more we can combine the costs and both save cash
2022-03-10 21:14:25	nihilazo	note that they list prices ex. VAT so keep that in mind (although the charge is applied before VAT)
2022-03-10 21:21:27	the_default	(there's a switch to show vat at the top)
2022-03-10 21:24:21	@vilmibm	!supdate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S991k9DV0v0
2022-03-10 21:24:21	sotdbot	Done! Your song of the day has been updated to Uchuu Keiji Shaider (Space Sheriff Shaider) Opening song
2022-03-10 21:24:27	nihilazo	ah cool the_default I didn't see
2022-03-10 21:25:35	dzwdz	does anyone here take power naps?
2022-03-10 21:26:02	dzwdz	ok that sounds like a question that an alien would ask
2022-03-10 21:26:19	dzwdz	still
2022-03-10 21:27:35	the_default	i have no idea if this is a bad idea or not. i'm either going to pick up a new hobby or waste $30+. it's something i've been thinking about for far too long now.
2022-03-10 21:28:10	the_default	i've filled up a cart with stuff then noped out so many times now
2022-03-10 21:28:16	the_default	i need to actually make decisions
2022-03-10 21:29:36	nihilazo	well you don't have to worry about the handling charge
2022-03-10 21:29:39	nihilazo	this tim
2022-03-10 21:29:39	nihilazo	e
2022-03-10 21:30:00	the_default	i mean that's one way of looking at it
2022-03-10 21:30:12	the_default	if i choose any time to waste money it's now
2022-03-10 21:30:14	asm	the_default: what hobby?
2022-03-10 21:31:02	the_default	electronics stuff
2022-03-10 21:31:18	dzwdz	you miss 100% of the shots you don't take
2022-03-10 21:31:20	dzwdz	or something
2022-03-10 21:31:24	the_default	mmm
2022-03-10 21:31:26	the_default	sure
2022-03-10 21:31:30	@vilmibm	dzwdz: i take power naps yeah
2022-03-10 21:31:44	@vilmibm	i mean i'll take 5-15 minutes and just relax every muscle and shut my eyes
2022-03-10 21:31:49	dzwdz	currently i'm sleeping for like 2.5h every day after school out of exhaustion
2022-03-10 21:31:56	@vilmibm	sometimes i doze off, sometimes i don't, but i always feel mentally better after
2022-03-10 21:32:07	dzwdz	it's hard for me not to fall asleep when i do that
2022-03-10 21:33:02	dzwdz	today i tried setting an alarm for 30min in but that didn't really work
2022-03-10 21:39:22	@vilmibm	your body needs a certain amount of sleep to function
2022-03-10 21:39:33	@vilmibm	and if it's asking for 2.5 hr naps at that point then it needs it :/
2022-03-10 21:40:06	dzwdz	yeah but then i end up having around 3 hours for myself
2022-03-10 21:40:09	dzwdz	when you subtract school
2022-03-10 21:40:23	dzwdz	which is pretty depressing
2022-03-10 21:40:54	@vilmibm	yeah
2022-03-10 21:40:56	@vilmibm	shit sucks
2022-03-10 21:41:15	@vilmibm	i hated needing sleep in college. i would endeavor to be up as much as possible, but inevitably would crash mid-morning or mid-day
2022-03-10 21:41:34	dzwdz	it's not really sleep that's the issue
2022-03-10 21:41:35	@vilmibm	i created a napping nest in the science building and would set alarms for the last possible minutes i could get to the dining hall for dinner
2022-03-10 21:41:36	dzwdz	it's school
2022-03-10 21:41:52	@vilmibm	well yeah, that's the thing that made me resent sleep.
2022-03-10 21:42:21	dzwdz	at this point i don't believe that there's any other purpose to school than to fuck kids up
2022-03-10 21:43:14	astrinaut	big mood
2022-03-10 21:43:47	dzwdz	today i had to wake up at 6:30 just to do literally nothing up until 12:05
2022-03-10 21:43:58	dzwdz	at least it's the time of the year when the sun's up
2022-03-10 21:44:04	@vilmibm	it's more of a generational trauma echoing forever thing less than any kind of concerted effort
2022-03-10 21:44:23	@vilmibm	i got a lot out of college but i also struggled mentally throughout
2022-03-10 21:44:36	dzwdz	it isn't a concentrated effort, but people in power sure aren't helping
2022-03-10 21:44:48	dzwdz	i'd actually argue the opposite, at least here
2022-03-10 21:44:50	dzwdz	so
2022-03-10 21:45:40	dzwdz	a benefit of thinking like this is that i do proper self-care out of pure spite
2022-03-10 21:46:05	m455	god college sleep was so hard lol
2022-03-10 21:51:15	flowercorpse	hobbyist electronics are in a horrible state imo
2022-03-10 21:52:52	flowercorpse	I generally wait until like 2-3 projects gather to order the parts
2022-03-10 21:54:51	flowercorpse	also a lot of cool chips aren't manufactured anymore
2022-03-10 21:55:52	elly	I also generally slept really badly during university compared to as an adult
2022-03-10 21:56:15	elly	partly because the other parts of my life (food & exercise) were way out of balance as well, and these things all reinforce each other, and partly because I just did not prioritize sleep
2022-03-10 21:56:16	bx	m455 / vilmibm: that's way way too inline with what im experiencing in college
2022-03-10 21:56:19	elly	and so I stayed up way late
2022-03-10 21:56:44	bx	elly: what counts as way late?
2022-03-10 21:57:03	dzwdz	i'm currently staying up just to get some work on any of my projects done today
2022-03-10 21:57:14	dzwdz	not that it's too late
2022-03-10 21:57:16	dzwdz	!timefor
2022-03-10 21:57:24	elly	bx: for me, midnight :)
2022-03-10 21:57:27	dzwdz	well, 22:57
2022-03-10 21:57:31	bx	elly: ah ok
2022-03-10 21:57:33	elly	I'm firmly a morning person
2022-03-10 21:57:39	bx	λucckkyyy
2022-03-10 21:57:41	 *	dzwdz is jealous
2022-03-10 21:57:42	@vilmibm	i "went to bed" around 6a usually
2022-03-10 21:57:50	dzwdz	ok that's bad
2022-03-10 21:57:58	elly	I don't think it is lucky really
2022-03-10 21:58:03	@vilmibm	2-4 hours of sleep, class, some food, 2-4 more hours sleep, dinner, go to linux lab, repeat
2022-03-10 21:58:06	bx	elly: why not ?
2022-03-10 21:58:08	elly	I get tired around 5pm and never have the energy to do social things in the evening :P
2022-03-10 21:58:17	bx	elly: Oh
2022-03-10 21:58:19	elly	"morning person" means your energy is front-loaded in the morning
2022-03-10 21:58:23	elly	not that you just have more of it overall
2022-03-10 21:58:27	bx	ig its kinda a grass is always greener kinda thing
2022-03-10 21:58:31	elly	absolutely
2022-03-10 21:58:33	dzwdz	pf, imagine having the energy to do social things
2022-03-10 21:58:40	elly	it is easy to see what you miss out on and not so easy to see what you get
2022-03-10 21:58:41	caff	vilmibm: Sounds like we have similar sleep schedules, haha. Even if I go to bed at like... 11pm, I have trouble falling asleep until 3-4am at the eraliest.
2022-03-10 21:58:41	bx	I need literaly hours to get my brain into "work mode"
2022-03-10 21:58:49	bx	it needs to "boot up"
2022-03-10 21:58:54	elly	yeah, I start my day in work mode but by 5pm I can't really do much of use usually
2022-03-10 21:58:54	@vilmibm	recently i go to bed aroun 2a
2022-03-10 21:58:54	caff	^eral^earl
2022-03-10 21:58:58	@vilmibm	and sleep ok until 10-11
2022-03-10 21:59:04	@vilmibm	depending on anxiety levels
2022-03-10 21:59:15	dzwdz	bx: that usually isn't the case for me but school fucks me up and i need time to recover
2022-03-10 21:59:26	dzwdz	it doesn't help that my class is... y'all know
2022-03-10 21:59:29	bx	valid
2022-03-10 21:59:37	dzwdz	fuck those guys
2022-03-10 22:09:20	bx	I think this is gur first time im thinking "darn i wish i'd done all my lecture notes digitally"
2022-03-10 22:10:15	extratone	I'm just popping in the conversation so forgive me but... we sort of are now living in the OCR renaissance rn
2022-03-10 22:10:37	extratone	it's still not pretty but it's a lot faster a less finnicky than it used to be.
2022-03-10 22:11:09	bx	-laughs-
2022-03-10 22:11:15	bx	my handwriting is unreadable to humans
2022-03-10 22:11:18	bx	let alone machines
2022-03-10 22:11:54	flowercorpse	my handwriting is exactly the font they taught me in first grade
2022-03-10 22:12:17	bx	if you have a "font" that's quite impressive
2022-03-10 22:12:30	flowercorpse	yes but it looks like a first grader wrote it
2022-03-10 22:12:48	bx	flowercorpse: on gur hobbyist electronics thing, how many descrete transistors do i have to order for it to be cheap?
2022-03-10 22:13:04	the_default	37.5 million
2022-03-10 22:13:07	bx	flowercorpse: i mean, if it's neat and comfortable to write who cares?
2022-03-10 22:13:18	bx	the_default: darn that's way too many
2022-03-10 22:13:29	bx	or was that a space chimps refference
2022-03-10 22:15:12	bx	no wait it wasnt that was 50.6 million
2022-03-10 22:15:30	extratone	alright bx send me a sample rn and I'll see what my Professional Apple Phone is able to make of it.
2022-03-10 22:16:06	flowercorpse	bx: depends on the transistor but they are generally pretty cheap, so a lot, to make up for the shipping
2022-03-10 22:16:18	bx	how many thousand?
2022-03-10 22:16:23	bx	and probs BJT
2022-03-10 22:16:34	bx	unless im mistaking what BJTs for
2022-03-10 22:16:41	extratone	I challenge you for worst handwriting - mine was so bad as a child I had a government handicap/document thing for it.
2022-03-10 22:18:06	bx	hold on
2022-03-10 22:18:38	bx	https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/570079967405408277/951604946342670427/IMG_20220310_221751.jpg
2022-03-10 22:18:43	bx	pardon gur discord link
2022-03-10 22:18:52	bx	and gur rotation
2022-03-10 22:19:45	dzwdz	most of that is readable but i can't read the 2nd and 3rd lines
2022-03-10 22:20:23	flowercorpse	bx: on most sites it is a lot cheaper if you buy in bulk, like upwards of a 100
2022-03-10 22:20:32	bx	flowercorpse: oh?
2022-03-10 22:20:39	flowercorpse	but what would you do with a lifetime supply of BJTs
2022-03-10 22:20:42	bx	i'd need a 2-5 thousand
2022-03-10 22:20:51	bx	and i'd be making a cpu
2022-03-10 22:21:00	flowercorpse	that's pretty fun
2022-03-10 22:21:01	bx	and then later video generation hardware
2022-03-10 22:21:13	bx	wait, how fast are bjts?
2022-03-10 22:21:26	bx	is there an option with faster swithching
2022-03-10 22:21:55	bx	dzwdz: "hello town/extratone" "the weather was"
2022-03-10 22:22:13	extratone	alright I copied what iOS recognized to the clipboard... haven't looked yet... gonna paste and send without editing.
2022-03-10 22:22:13	flowercorpse	they are faster than FETs in most cases
2022-03-10 22:22:16	extratone	nice tally!
2022-03-10 22:22:51	extratone	yeah maybe it's not gonna be the solution lol
2022-03-10 22:23:40	bx	flowercorpse: How fast are FETs? ideally i'd want my cpu to compete with an low cost avr, so 16Mhz
2022-03-10 22:23:47	flowercorpse	but I think you would use FETs in digital circuits
2022-03-10 22:23:52	extratone	https://ttm.sh/ir2.png
2022-03-10 22:23:59	 *	bx knows not a ton about electronics
2022-03-10 22:24:18	bx	extratone: that was "nice today"
2022-03-10 22:24:44	extratone	I could read all of it! I guess the phone needs a few more years.
2022-03-10 22:24:52	bx	yea :/
2022-03-10 22:25:10	extratone	I would reciprocate but I only have halves of pens lying around somehow.
2022-03-10 22:25:16	bx	oh some of my wrting in notes is worse though cause i cram for space and have to go faster
2022-03-10 22:25:27	bx	extratone: no pencils?
2022-03-10 22:25:51	bx	gur pencil writes in any orientation! and in any human habitable tempurature!
2022-03-10 22:26:02	extratone	noooo. but you gotta remember I haven't been in school of any kind for 10 years. and I cannot draw.
2022-03-10 22:26:13	flowercorpse	bx: it's usually given on the datasheet
2022-03-10 22:26:20	bx	flowercorpse: Ah
2022-03-10 22:26:34	bx	I'd have to check that out then
2022-03-10 22:26:38	-->	darkwitchclaire (darkwitchclaire@localhost) has joined #tildetown
2022-03-10 22:27:03	bx	if i *could* hit 16Mhz for <£40 in parts i'd actually start planning it
2022-03-10 22:27:40	darkwitchclaire	!water
2022-03-10 22:27:40	 *	pinhook waters darkwitchclaire's godly mature agave
2022-03-10 22:28:09	bx	!talklike darkwitchclaire
2022-03-10 22:28:09	pinhook	i've been researching hdds since it works on all my machines are named after sega arcade boards
2022-03-10 22:28:10	flowercorpse	I mean if you're going to build it out of discrete transistors it will be much slower than something with an integrated cpu, bx
2022-03-10 22:28:31	bx	im only aiming to compete with an mcu
2022-03-10 22:28:47	bx	e.g. gur chip in gur arduino uno
2022-03-10 22:29:22	bx	since i already know that's enough to do fun things with
2022-03-10 22:29:51	bx	but if i cant match it's speed i'd probs just be better off making said thing *out* of avr microj
2022-03-10 22:29:52	bx	s
2022-03-10 22:31:24	flowercorpse	the switching speed in FETs is mostly to do with capacitance so larger FETs are a lot slower
2022-03-10 22:32:02	bx	awww
2022-03-10 22:32:20	bx	is there a way to like sink them faster or smthn
2022-03-10 22:32:55	bx	or other kinds of transistors who's speed isnt so tightly linked to size
2022-03-10 22:36:33	bx	brrrb (gonna be off pc for a bit)
2022-03-10 22:36:37	flowercorpse	BJTs are faster but they aren't really suitable for digital circuits
2022-03-10 22:55:10	the_default	i keep searching for a new color theme
2022-03-10 22:55:23	the_default	but i can't find anything nicer than gruvbox
2022-03-10 22:55:56	the_default	it's too nice, crushes anything and everything else
2022-03-10 23:04:42	the_default	ok take that back
2022-03-10 23:07:00	<--	palmdrop (palmdrop@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)

2022-03-10 23:11:31	twee	got another shift so i guess it went well

2022-03-10 23:50:52	bx	im dealing with that as we speak lol
2022-03-10 23:50:55	flowercorpse	especially teams
2022-03-10 23:50:55	extratone	how many times will you check "don't show this again" in your academic career.
2022-03-10 23:51:37	astrinaut	it never stops showing up
2022-03-10 23:51:41	extratone	oh god I'm so sorry. I can't even imagine having to actually rely on teams.
2022-03-10 23:51:45	bx	extratone: too many
2022-03-10 23:52:02	bx	flowercorpse: teams is so shitty
2022-03-10 23:52:09	bx	"Are you still there"
2022-03-10 23:52:17	twee	quick question: is it "right" to use some random portrait off unsplash as a bandcamp artist picture
2022-03-10 23:52:19	bx	* clicks im back, despite never being gone *
2022-03-10 23:52:25	bx	* page reloades *
2022-03-10 23:52:25	flowercorpse	teams is like the worst electron app I used
2022-03-10 23:52:27	extratone	as a Pro former 365 Enterprise Admin (for an org of 2 lol) my Pro Advice is: just stop checking the box. nothing actually changes.
2022-03-10 23:52:29	bx	* screams *
2022-03-10 23:52:33	flowercorpse	and that's a contested category
2022-03-10 23:52:36	astrinaut	lol extratone

2022-03-10 23:52:58	bx	extratone: oh i stopped a while ago
2022-03-10 23:53:03	extratone	365 is a museum, nothing more.
2022-03-10 23:53:06	bx	flowercorpse: i use gur web version
2022-03-10 23:53:32	bx	like half gur time i have to download stuff and then save it to google docs
2022-03-10 23:53:39	flowercorpse	I genuinely don't even understand teams from a conceptual standpoint
2022-03-10 23:53:47	flowercorpse	like what does it even do good
2022-03-10 23:53:49	extratone	^ thank you.
2022-03-10 23:53:52	bx	nothing
2022-03-10 23:53:56	flowercorpse	exactly
2022-03-10 23:54:01	flowercorpse	it does everything sub par
2022-03-10 23:54:02	extratone	I have no idea why they continue to drill down on it so hard.
2022-03-10 23:54:05	flowercorpse	slow as shit
2022-03-10 23:54:16	bx	ive never used google classroom, but if its based on docs it sounds much nicer
2022-03-10 23:54:21	extratone	classic Microsoft cycles would have seen them accept and give up by now. it's actually worrying.
2022-03-10 23:55:04	extratone	I happened to overhear a two-person starbucks meeting earlier today that appeared to be one helping the other transition from slack to teams and it was very painful.
2022-03-10 23:55:14	bx	; - ;
2022-03-10 23:55:47	bx	that's so sad
2022-03-10 23:56:07	extratone	I really like satya so it's been especially weird to watch him make eye contact with the camera and proclaim teams to be the future
2022-03-10 23:56:19	bx	with teams sucking as much as it does, i'd honestly preffer to do it on paper
2022-03-10 23:56:29	extratone	it's also blatantly obvious he hates it lol
2022-03-10 23:56:30	bx	satya?

2022-03-10 23:57:11	extratone	sorry I have a weird mostly former relationship with microsoft 
2022-03-10 23:57:15	astrinaut	there are so many things that are nicer on paper
2022-03-10 23:57:27	flowercorpse	I write all my notes on paper
2022-03-10 23:57:48	extratone	I really don't think paper and digital text are interchangeable and am not sure why we think they should be.
2022-03-10 23:57:57	astrinaut	+
2022-03-10 23:58:03	bx	large companies with billions of dolars in resources shipping products that are outright subpar and broken is gonna be my new go to example trying to convince people capitalism does not work
2022-03-10 23:58:03	flowercorpse	as in notes for university
2022-03-10 23:58:28	bx	flowercorpse: im gonna swap to digital when uni starts

2022-03-10 23:58:50	bx	extratone: Oof that sounds terrible
2022-03-10 23:59:11	flowercorpse	bx: it's also because protocols aren't open anymore, like no one can write a better teams client because microsoft says no
2022-03-10 23:59:16	bx	btw, i plan on taking notes on a small laptop ive had for ~6yrs / a ps-vita
2022-03-10 23:59:19	extratone	no just realizing that capitalism doesn't work. nothing unusual or profound.
2022-03-10 23:59:26	bx	flowercorpse: yeaaaaa
2022-03-10 23:59:40	bx	extratone: ah

2022-03-11 00:00:30	bx	fuck why can't we all just use email again
2022-03-11 00:00:32	flowercorpse	facebook could easily integrate instagram messaging with whatsapp and/or facebook messenger since it owns all of them
2022-03-11 00:00:36	extratone	outlook is the best thing about microsoft imo and I still miss it every day.
2022-03-11 00:00:42	flowercorpse	bx: email is the best

2022-03-11 01:09:34	caff	I'll probably try to roll it into sotdbot v3 (Never did finish v2 :') Nim's fun, but definitely not my favorite lang, haha)
2022-03-11 01:09:50	flowercorpse	for me reading it back is 60% funny and 40% disturbing
2022-03-11 01:09:58	bx	flowercorpse: i used to but havent kept one gur last few years
2022-03-11 01:10:18	bx	i should start again
2022-03-11 01:10:31	bx	i remmeber one from last night quite vividly
2022-03-11 01:10:53	bx	though at gur same time it all kinda shifts around and changes perspective a few times
2022-03-11 01:11:29	twee	sotdbot is in nim?  didn't know that
2022-03-11 01:11:59	 *	bx thought gur re-write was gonna be in nim

2022-03-11 02:00:17	citrons	the thing that I am doing right now is making a memory allocator. instead of malloc, the function is called "getvec" in certain instances of B
2022-03-11 02:00:29	citrons	this is presumably because it gets a vector
2022-03-11 02:00:36	bx	makes sense
2022-03-11 02:00:45	asm	in 5 days, one project of mine, py0x0 would've gone a full year without any updates -- I kind of want to do something to break that early lol

2022-03-11 02:08:59	bx	unless that was like, gur point of something
2022-03-11 02:09:07	citrons	hmm I see
2022-03-11 02:09:13	bx	like a b game jam or iobcc
2022-03-11 02:09:38	bx	(international obfuscated b code competititon)
2022-03-11 02:10:11	citrons	I quite like B. in a geniune manner and not just due to its historical interestingness
2022-03-11 02:12:15	bx	Fair
2022-03-11 02:12:41	bx	i like abusing gur C preprocessor to get features im not meant to have
2022-03-11 02:12:51	bx	and also lisps/concatenative langs
2022-03-11 02:13:11	citrons	is "gur" some sort of article or something
2022-03-11 02:13:31	citrons	the C preprocessor is fun to abuse
2022-03-11 02:15:36	bx	gur = rot13(the)
2022-03-11 02:15:43	citrons	I see
2022-03-11 02:15:46	citrons	the.
2022-03-11 02:16:00	bx	i use it in place of the when im typing here
2022-03-11 02:16:13	citrons	what is the reason for this
2022-03-11 02:16:20	bx	so
2022-03-11 02:16:33	bx	originally i tried to stop using "the" comepltetly
2022-03-11 02:16:43	bx	it proved too hard so i gave up
2022-03-11 02:16:58	bx	later on i realised after reading some rot13'd text that gur = the
2022-03-11 02:17:06	bx	and i kinda took a liking to it
2022-03-11 02:17:16	bx	so, i decided to swap to gur
2022-03-11 02:17:23	citrons	reasonable
2022-03-11 02:17:31	bx	gur main motivation is kinda just a linguistic experiemtn
2022-03-11 02:17:44	bx	to make sure i keep flexing my metaphorical changing muscles
2022-03-11 02:17:44	citrons	I enjoy such things
2022-03-11 02:18:13	bx	youre welcome to join gur gur gang
2022-03-11 02:18:48	citrons	hmm, I disagree with "gur" aesthetically
2022-03-11 02:19:04	citrons	I'm quite particular about the aesthetic of my text
2022-03-11 02:20:49	bx	Fiar

2022-03-11 02:22:12	bx	if you wanna see an example of preprocesssor abuse check out, ~bx/types.h and ~bx/reflect.h
2022-03-11 02:22:15	bx	flowercorpse: yea
2022-03-11 02:22:25	bx	...and only language (so far)
2022-03-11 02:22:30	bx	is it yours?
2022-03-11 02:23:07	flowercorpse	actually third
2022-03-11 02:23:11	flowercorpse	practically second though
2022-03-11 02:23:40	asm	if you don't mind me asking, what are your first and second?
2022-03-11 02:24:25	flowercorpse	second is german, but I'm very bad at german, so it doesn't really count
2022-03-11 02:25:51	flowercorpse	but I prefer not to tell where I'm from
2022-03-11 02:26:17	bx	Woah, third is quite allot
2022-03-11 02:27:28	bx	i still find it crazy impressive that tons of people here can just logon and start using english so well i cant tell if theyre a native speaker or not, despite speaking an entire other language in addition
2022-03-11 02:29:29	asm	woo I was able to get my old botany plant back

2022-03-11 03:29:44	citrons	wait, how does mail work
2022-03-11 03:30:27	asm	mail on tilde.town?
2022-03-11 03:30:37	 *	bx still hasnt quite figured out how town mail really works
2022-03-11 03:30:41	citrons	yes
2022-03-11 03:30:51	@natalia	it is local
2022-03-11 03:31:01	citrons	by what means
2022-03-11 03:31:20	@natalia	i think addresses are just @tilde.town
2022-03-11 03:31:28	asm	you can't email outside of tilde.town
2022-03-11 03:31:30	@natalia	by what means what
2022-03-11 03:31:40	@natalia	it smtp listens on localhost
2022-03-11 03:31:44	@natalia	u can use mutt
2022-03-11 03:31:51	citrons	I see
2022-03-11 03:32:26	citrons	is the password my unix password
2022-03-11 03:32:41	citrons	hmm, how do I even change that
2022-03-11 03:33:19	@natalia	if you need a unix password to.access mutt we broke something
2022-03-11 03:33:25	citrons	oh, no
2022-03-11 03:33:30	citrons	I just want to use a different email client
2022-03-11 03:34:08	@natalia	you don't need a password i tjink
2022-03-11 03:34:14	asm	I don't think you can access it from outside of tilde.town
2022-03-11 03:34:15	@natalia	frankly i am unsure of unix mail mechanisms
2022-03-11 03:34:19	@natalia	it may not use smtp
2022-03-11 03:34:27	citrons	I see.
2022-03-11 03:34:35	asm	there isn't outbound connections for IMAP/POP or SMTP afaik
2022-03-11 03:34:48	citrons	alpine is confusing to me
2022-03-11 03:34:54	citrons	I don't know how it knows how to send the mail
2022-03-11 03:35:38	asm	personally I would recommend using a domain you own yourself for email rather than any tildes or similar gratis services of the sort
2022-03-11 03:37:02	citrons	you are misconstruing me
2022-03-11 03:37:41	citrons	I am just wondering how the local mail system works
2022-03-11 03:37:56	@natalia	actually i am wrong, i think it is posix sendmail
2022-03-11 03:38:08	citrons	in any case, I seem to be unable to compile this email client, so it is moot
2022-03-11 03:38:56	@natalia	what client
2022-03-11 03:39:05	citrons	aerc
2022-03-11 03:41:19	asm	never heard of it
2022-03-11 03:42:20	citrons	it is the email client I use for normal email. I was wondering if I could compile it and use it for email on this server, but it seems I that I cannot. it does not matter much, however
2022-03-11 03:43:17	asm	what's not working with compiling?

2022-03-11 04:24:54	@natalia	11 is eagain?

2022-03-11 04:33:37	asm	nice!
2022-03-11 04:33:45	citrons	well, I've compiled it on my own computer, but
2022-03-11 04:33:45	@natalia	does it have gears?
2022-03-11 04:33:56	citrons	even installing it is causing erroring. hmmm
2022-03-11 04:34:08	citrons	I'll just copy the files myself
2022-03-11 04:34:33	@natalia	let me know if i need to do any weird infrastructure stuff here

2022-03-11 04:36:14	josh	none of it is magic or anything, but it still is super cool
2022-03-11 04:36:16	citrons	my short-term memory just emptied

2022-03-11 04:39:36	bx	unless u set ur own colors
2022-03-11 04:50:09	extratone	this is going to sound ignorant but... somehow the themes I've imported into Blink on iOS are showing up as Terminal profiles????? I guess I'm glad I bothered to get this far because I did not see that mentioned in the docs at all lol
2022-03-11 04:50:42	bx	intresting
2022-03-11 04:51:00	bx	maybe those themes were based off of gur terminal ones
2022-03-11 04:51:28	bx	...unless theres some wierd ios->macos term theme sharing system
2022-03-11 04:52:27	extratone	iCloud but a hidden folder, I think.
2022-03-11 04:52:42	extratone	luv unnecessarily obfuscated happenings so much.
2022-03-11 04:54:26	bx	lmao
2022-03-11 04:59:17	citrons	here is something I would like large amounts of people to engage in: https://zzcxz.citrons.xyz/

2022-03-11 05:00:44	citrons	wow, I am on the television.
2022-03-11 05:01:10	bx	>HOME
2022-03-11 05:01:32	citrons	yes, from context clues, your location seems to be HOME or such
2022-03-11 05:01:37	bx	irc on a tv feels somehow wierd and sureal
2022-03-11 05:02:32	citrons	ok, but I must pose a question
2022-03-11 05:02:33	extratone	thank you! especially when it's being cast by a goddamned cellular. I'm glad someone else noticed lol
2022-03-11 05:02:52	citrons	by what means was this photo taken
2022-03-11 05:03:01	citrons	your phone is within the picture, as well as both of your hands
2022-03-11 05:03:19	extratone	I asked my 71-year-old mother very nicely
2022-03-11 05:03:31	citrons	ah, I see
2022-03-11 05:04:30	extratone	I don't know how I ended up here in life, tbh. 
2022-03-11 05:05:19	bx	casting irc to a tv?
2022-03-11 05:05:25	bx	or more general than that
2022-03-11 05:05:27	extratone	with a phone, yes.
2022-03-11 05:05:40	extratone	on my mother's couch. 
2022-03-11 05:05:47	bx	well ig your first step was getting a phone
2022-03-11 05:05:56	extratone	a mistake.
2022-03-11 05:06:03	bx	second would be getting access to irc
2022-03-11 05:06:10	bx	and i'd vote third is gur couch
2022-03-11 05:06:20	citrons	I presume your mother obtained that couch somehow
2022-03-11 05:06:35	citrons	that would contribute to your being on it at the moment

2022-03-11 16:10:53	extratone	howdy town.
2022-03-11 16:10:57	zyloh	that'll do it
2022-03-11 16:11:01	login	howdy, that's another one
2022-03-11 16:11:01	zyloh	hello extratone
2022-03-11 16:11:06	login	hello is a third one
2022-03-11 16:11:06	zyloh	also true
2022-03-11 16:11:12	zyloh	english does have quite a few built in
2022-03-11 16:11:37	elly	you can say "good day" if you want
2022-03-11 16:11:50	elly	I usually just say (eg) "Happy Friday"
2022-03-11 16:11:57	zyloh	that's a good one
2022-03-11 16:13:11	extratone	I logged in to town for a bit on an actual computer for the first time last night. what a trip.
2022-03-11 16:13:14	zyloh	there was some word i think someone came up with for irc but it probably wasn't very widely used
2022-03-11 16:13:43	zyloh	how did it make you feel?
2022-03-11 16:18:00	extratone	I don't really feel, but if I did, my answer would probably be "a wee bit nervous."
2022-03-11 16:20:01	asm	hello
2022-03-11 16:20:50	zyloh	i'm curious, is there like a significant difference between using a computer to do that kinda stuff and using a phone, beyond probably the most "obvious"?
2022-03-11 16:21:16	zyloh	i've never really thought to play around with my phone like that
2022-03-11 16:21:28	zyloh	hello asm!
2022-03-11 16:21:36	asm	how's it going?
2022-03-11 16:22:10	zyloh	i'm doing alright, had a pretty slow day so far
2022-03-11 16:22:13	extratone	I've been working on a guide. https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink the answer is way less than you'd think. or think reasonable lol
2022-03-11 16:22:21	zyloh	what about yourself?
2022-03-11 16:23:06	zyloh	skimming it seems really interesting
2022-03-11 16:23:17	zyloh	it seems a lot more useable than i expected really
2022-03-11 16:25:01	extratone	if you're in a position to - not move - like me so you can keep power and a keyboard connected to your phone, it's basically the full experience. but the question is... if you're in a position to do that, why aren't you just using a computer?
2022-03-11 16:27:19	zyloh	i really wanna get a keyboard for my phone now and try this stuff out
2022-03-11 16:27:30	zyloh	what is a phone if not a cute computer you know?
2022-03-11 16:28:14	login	just need a way to 'zoom' into the phone
2022-03-11 16:28:23	login	using special glasses maybe
2022-03-11 16:28:24	elly	the size gap between the biggest phones and the smallest netbooks isn't that large now
2022-03-11 16:29:03	login	and the foldables really do make the gap 'overlap'
2022-03-11 16:29:20	elly	ya, and tablets
2022-03-11 16:30:24	zyloh	i like how we as a species are working hard to make these distinctions ever more arbitrary
2022-03-11 16:31:53	login	a tablet stand with a wireless keyboard and a 'desktop accelerator' would be good enough to be all devices
2022-03-11 16:32:20	login	put the phone into the tablet, the tablet into the stand (with desktop accelerator) and have the wireless keyboard and mouse connect
2022-03-11 16:32:30	login	now there's a desktop, laptop, tablet and phone all in one
2022-03-11 16:33:49	zyloh	we really live in the future
2022-03-11 16:34:52	extratone	zyloh omg I love that cute computer quote so much you have no idea.
2022-03-11 16:35:26	login	which one?
2022-03-11 16:35:37	extratone	well if you find yourself keyboarding to an *iPhone*, specifically, I am probably the world's second or third foremost authority on the subject so please make use of me.
2022-03-11 16:35:52	extratone	"what is a phone if not a cute computer you know?"
2022-03-11 16:36:32	zyloh	haha thanks for the tips extratone
2022-03-11 16:36:47	extratone	(I am not exactly proud of the fact, nor would I have chosen it as the thing to know things about, but it is my life, now lol.)
2022-03-11 16:36:53	zyloh	sadly my only phone is a very easily brickable sony
2022-03-11 16:37:07	extratone	which model?
2022-03-11 16:37:09	login	you should be consulted on a movie
2022-03-11 16:37:16	login	in which hackers use keyboards with phones
2022-03-11 16:37:24	zyloh	xperia xz3
2022-03-11 16:37:26	login	a hacker movie parody
2022-03-11 16:37:27	extratone	LMAO. the world's most absurd, tedious hacker movie.
2022-03-11 16:37:37	zyloh	hahahaha that would be amazing
2022-03-11 16:37:41	login	a hacker on an iphone would be funny on its own
2022-03-11 16:37:53	elly	it's no good sir we can't trace the login he zalgotexted his username
2022-03-11 16:37:54	login	but a hacker on an iphone with a keyboard, that would get snorts
2022-03-11 16:38:02	elly	[slams hand on desk] dammit, this guy's good
2022-03-11 16:38:05	extratone	nice! I don't know much about the rest of the line but the Xperia Play is still probably my favorite handset of all time.
2022-03-11 16:38:14	login	extratone: lol
2022-03-11 16:38:17	login	*elly
2022-03-11 16:38:40	login	Wish Sony focused on software and outdid Samsung on that front
2022-03-11 16:38:42	extratone	the apple-adjacent people I've been hanging out with refer to the stuff I do as "hacks." 
2022-03-11 16:39:02	extratone	but it's just... using the phone.
2022-03-11 16:39:08	login	because apple refuses to support freedom of keyboard connectivity?
2022-03-11 16:39:30	extratone	what do you mean by that, specifically?
2022-03-11 16:39:31	login	i.e., those who can only afford iphones but not computers would have no way to 'code'
2022-03-11 16:39:37	login	without typing on the virtual keboard
2022-03-11 16:39:51	login	extratone: i mean, using a keyboard and mouse with an iphone
2022-03-11 16:39:53	extratone	https://uikeycommand.com
2022-03-11 16:39:58	login	oh
2022-03-11 16:40:36	extratone	they refuse to document or acknowledge it, which is basically the same as refusing to support it.
2022-03-11 16:41:39	extratone	god I need to update that page.
2022-03-11 16:41:45	zyloh	it feels like a lot of companies draw this hard line between being "developer friendly" or being "user friendly"
2022-03-11 16:41:58	zyloh	i feel like that doesn't need to be the case
2022-03-11 16:42:38	extratone	We Are All Just Users Bro
2022-03-11 16:42:48	zyloh	great slogan
2022-03-11 16:42:58	extratone	We Are All End Users
2022-03-11 16:43:11	zyloh	WAAEU
2022-03-11 16:43:16	extratone	that's literally what I am.
2022-03-11 16:44:37	zyloh	yeah like i don't think the iphone would necessarily be less usable by like my grandma even if they started officially documenting external keyboards
2022-03-11 16:45:13	tomasino	We Are All Associates

2022-03-11 16:53:20	elly	in this case it's not attached to any specific other holiday, it is just a random friday we got given as a day off
2022-03-11 16:53:26	elly	there are about a dozen of these per year
2022-03-11 16:53:34	lown	that's so... odd
2022-03-11 16:53:44	elly	a lot of companies have been doing it since covid started, not really sure why
2022-03-11 16:53:50	elly	not that I really mind :P
2022-03-11 16:53:59	zyloh	"everyone needs to chill"-day
2022-03-11 16:54:01	lown	at my job i just left, management made a big deal of 'giving everyone an extra day off on their birthday'
2022-03-11 16:54:24	lown	and then explained that that just meant we all had an extra day of leave
2022-03-11 16:54:32	lown	we didn't need to take it on our birthdays
2022-03-11 16:54:50	lown	sure sounds good though, bet marketing came up with that

2022-03-11 17:04:02	lown	-lat---long?
2022-03-11 17:04:09	elly	negative values are still unambiguous, that one did have a negative long
2022-03-11 17:04:13	extratone	oh shit. that second value might actually be negative lol
2022-03-11 17:04:25	lown	haha i was wondering
2022-03-11 17:04:25	extratone	I didn't consider that.... I don't move.
2022-03-11 17:04:34	elly	but yeah you can't just split on '-' with that format
2022-03-11 17:04:39	elly	maybe better to use commas or something :P

2022-03-11 17:15:59	lown	in my defence, i have covid, everything is kinda blurry
2022-03-11 17:16:12	lown	it's impressive i've managed to get onto irc at all
2022-03-11 17:16:25	lown	earlier today i watched two whole missions impossible
2022-03-11 17:16:36	zyloh	oh jeez i hope you're taking good care of yourself!
2022-03-11 17:16:57	zyloh	missions impossible
2022-03-11 17:16:58	lown	i am! i'm drinking lots of water and tea and eating vegetables and feeling rank
2022-03-11 17:17:05	zyloh	english is such a wack thing
2022-03-11 17:17:11	zyloh	that's great to hear
2022-03-11 17:17:19	lown	well it's not 'mission impossibles' is it, that would be silly
2022-03-11 17:17:29	zyloh	i would argue it is silly either way
2022-03-11 17:17:35	lown	that is correct
2022-03-11 17:18:44	@natalia	i discovered recently that our ircd does not actually rate limit us
2022-03-11 17:18:55	@natalia	and weechat actually does that
2022-03-11 17:18:57	elly	maybe the clients still do
2022-03-11 17:18:57	elly	ah
2022-03-11 17:19:12	@natalia	i have been trying to figure out if we adjusting it in configs here would make it more or less painful
2022-03-11 17:19:29	jmjl	zyloh: who where you greeting in this message? <<<16:56:54 <zyloh> helloo>>>
2022-03-11 17:20:29	zyloh	jmjl natalia said hi a message prior
2022-03-11 17:20:54	jmjl	what natalia says is true, I had sent a few (4) lines in another channel as a backlog with another client different than weechat which is called catgirl and didn't need to wait for the rate-limit.
2022-03-11 17:21:22	jmjl	Oh, I thinked you where saying hi because of my bot's suddent leave,join.
2022-03-11 17:21:28	@natalia	i have heard of catgirl but not tried it
2022-03-11 17:21:52	zyloh	oh i didn't see any leave/join messages
2022-03-11 17:21:58	jmjl	It is pretty nice and it is also ssl only. https://git.causal.agency/catgirl is the source and it is installed here :)
2022-03-11 17:22:11	dzwdz	i'm waiting for the catboy fork
2022-03-11 17:22:34	jmjl	dzwdz: What would you like in the catboy fork to be modified?
2022-03-11 17:22:53	dzwdz	allow connecting without ssl
2022-03-11 17:23:16	dzwdz	multi server support, perhaps
2022-03-11 17:23:23	zyloh	catgirl looks really nice
2022-03-11 17:24:24	jmjl	Maybe I'll try to do that.

2022-03-11 17:35:47	lown	am i gonna be the first to be like. why not use weechat
2022-03-11 17:35:52	elly	you might just want weechat to be honest with you - irssi is not all that flexible
2022-03-11 17:36:03	дведь	i heavily dislike weechat's configuration
2022-03-11 17:36:38	lown	ah yeah fair, this is why i'm currently using a gui client on my laptop
2022-03-11 17:36:56	lown	sometimes you wanna open a settings panel y'know?
2022-03-11 17:37:03	elly	I think you could write an irssi plugin that does what you want
2022-03-11 17:37:17	elly	but I don't think it has a builtin way to do that

2022-03-11 18:42:37	dzwdz	relay != irc
2022-03-11 18:42:43	dzwdz	you need to set it up in your client

2022-03-11 18:55:07	lown	okay, to the best of my knowledge AO3 does _not_ contain any fanfic about Starbuck drinking Starbucks

2022-03-11 18:55:18	dzwdz	\o/
2022-03-11 18:55:27	dzwdz	you have an account there?
2022-03-11 18:55:41	lown	No, I don't, definitely more of a lurker
2022-03-11 18:55:57	lown	My fanfic does not need to see the inside of anything but my hard drive
2022-03-11 18:56:09	login	ao3 is *the* fanfic site right?
2022-03-11 18:56:12	dzwdz	yea

2022-03-11 18:58:50	twee	im actually kind of a huge fan of ardour
2022-03-11 18:58:54	twee	having used it very little
2022-03-11 18:58:55	twee	i like it
2022-03-11 19:00:29	@natalia	https://danluu.com/file-consistency/ good article
2022-03-11 19:01:23	lown	ooh thanks
2022-03-11 19:01:37	lown	i was just recently thinking about email consistency
2022-03-11 19:02:01	lown	my mum has huge mailboxes and they got corrupted constantly on outlook
2022-03-11 19:02:20	lown	apple mail has actually been really good, general trend of the times i suppose
2022-03-11 19:02:42	extratone	how long ago were these outlook problems?
2022-03-11 19:02:58	lown	oh like years ago, which is what i mean by 'trend of the times'
2022-03-11 19:03:15	lown	in that she's only been using apple mail the last five or so years
2022-03-11 19:03:19	extratone	ah. I was just lamenting how much I miss Outlook still lol. 
2022-03-11 19:03:39	lown	i still miss the interface of outlook express, which she used when i was a kid
2022-03-11 19:03:43	extratone	Apple's Mail client is still the worst mail client on their platforms but the service itself is great.
2022-03-11 19:04:11	extratone	having been a 365 admin... Outlook is by far the most redeemable piece of software Microsoft distributes.
2022-03-11 19:04:26	extratone	enterprise software, anyway.
2022-03-11 19:04:57	lown	i've slowly stopped ragging on MS's software over the last few years, from a stability/maintainability perspective anyway
2022-03-11 19:05:12	lown	teams can absolutely get fucked though.
2022-03-11 19:05:35	twee	so glad reader mode exists
2022-03-11 19:05:38	twee	for dan luu's site
2022-03-11 19:06:03	lown	80 column mode plugin for firefox when
2022-03-11 19:06:14	extratone	we were talking about teams yesterday lmao.
2022-03-11 19:06:28	dzwdz	like i get the idea, but cmon, is `<style>body{max-width:80ch}</style>` really that bloated
2022-03-11 19:06:41	lown	old job used teams for all company communication, except that all the devs used mattermost
2022-03-11 19:07:17	lown	every so often management would pop up and ask how the devs would feel about moving to teams and closing mattermost
2022-03-11 19:07:31	lown	i have never seen so many people get so angry so fast.
2022-03-11 19:08:42	extratone	yeah I was saying yesterday... I switched my job away from 365 ent just as Microsoft REALLY started insisting on Teams and honestly it seems like the more resistance they get the more they drill down on it.
2022-03-11 19:08:49	extratone	it's weird even for Microsoft.
2022-03-11 19:09:23	extratone	I got to ask a guy on the Skype team (which still exists... what a BS job lmfao) wtf 
2022-03-11 19:09:32	extratone	and he would not utter a word about anything.
2022-03-11 19:09:46	lown	i wager it saves them a lot of money to consolidate
2022-03-11 19:09:58	extratone	"I'm not comfortable talking about my job in that sense." as if Skype's source code is a state secret.
2022-03-11 19:10:08	extratone	proprietary culture is SO weird.
2022-03-11 19:10:15	lown	yeah, word.
2022-03-11 19:10:43	extratone	I just literally wanted to know a single activity of his workday.
2022-03-11 19:10:50	extratone	on the Skype team.
2022-03-11 19:11:24	lown	like when everything sort of drifted down from sharepoint into onedrive
2022-03-11 19:11:39	extratone	BUT EVERYTHING IS STILL BUILT THE SAME. at least on enterprise.
2022-03-11 19:12:24	extratone	they literally just took away the options menus so if you actually want to accomplish basic shit you have to find the azure console and tell it old sharepoint-cli commands lmao.
2022-03-11 19:12:25	lown	in the defence of the skype team's sterling work, if they closed skype and collapsed it into teams, it would give a lot of long distance children a lot of tech headaches
2022-03-11 19:12:39	extratone	sorry I'll shut up about msadmin shit but it was such a bizarre experience lol
2022-03-11 19:12:46	lown	i for one and perfectly happy not needing to explain to my mother how teams works
2022-03-11 19:12:54	lown	s/and/am
2022-03-11 19:12:54	sedbot	<lown> i for one am perfectly happy not needing to explain to my mother how teams works
2022-03-11 19:13:08	extratone	same!
2022-03-11 19:13:41	lown	right, dinner, talk later town x
2022-03-11 19:14:17	extratone	o/ lown thanks for chatting
2022-03-11 19:15:47	twee	i hope they use 365 ent at google
2022-03-11 19:19:45	extratone	I'm sure somebody Google owns and forgot about long ago certainly does.
2022-03-11 19:21:57	elly	we definitely use the various google apps :P
2022-03-11 19:22:57	astrinaut	i use a competitor's product at work, every bigcorp has teams that dgaf
2022-03-11 19:23:11	dzwdz	you gotta know your competition

2022-03-11 19:31:48	nihilazo	FUCK
2022-03-11 19:31:55	nihilazo	the USB port on this norns has broken off
2022-03-11 19:31:58	the_default	(have you broken a usb port)
2022-03-11 19:31:58	nihilazo	it's not even my thing
2022-03-11 19:32:03	nihilazo	I have broken a USB port
2022-03-11 19:32:05	the_default	oh no
2022-03-11 19:32:05	dzwdz	:(
2022-03-11 19:32:07	nihilazo	it's not my device
2022-03-11 19:32:13	nihilazo	and it's worth like 800 bucks
2022-03-11 19:32:14	the_default	oh oh no
2022-03-11 19:32:19	nihilazo	I'm boned.
2022-03-11 19:32:20	dzwdz	oh fuck
2022-03-11 19:32:29	the_default	extra oh no with extra oh no sauce
2022-03-11 19:32:35	nihilazo	I didn't do anything! I just tried to plug a USB cable into ti and it broken
2022-03-11 19:32:43	nihilazo	I am very good at breaking things it seems
2022-03-11 19:32:44	dzwdz	don't touch it anymore
2022-03-11 19:32:44	nihilazo	fuck
2022-03-11 19:32:48	dzwdz	don't try to repair it
2022-03-11 19:32:50	nihilazo	I'm going to see what happened to it
2022-03-11 19:32:54	nihilazo	not gonna try and repair it
2022-03-11 19:32:59	dzwdz	you'll risk damaging it further
2022-03-11 19:33:06	nihilazo	I am going to contact the person I am borrowing it from to say I'm so so sorry
2022-03-11 19:33:08	dzwdz	are you sure that it isn't just a faulty cable?
2022-03-11 19:33:10	nihilazo	but it just broke
2022-03-11 19:33:15	nihilazo	yeah there is no socket any more
2022-03-11 19:33:20	nihilazo	I think it broke off the PCB
2022-03-11 19:33:21	dzwdz	bruh what
2022-03-11 19:33:22	nihilazo	fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
2022-03-11 19:33:29	nihilazo	extra oh no sauce indeed
2022-03-11 19:33:32	dzwdz	ok that actually isn't that bad
2022-03-11 19:33:37	dzwdz	you could probably just solder it back on
2022-03-11 19:33:39	dzwdz	calm down
2022-03-11 19:33:44	nihilazo	yeah but it's not my device
2022-03-11 19:33:49	nihilazo	and I am shit at soldering
2022-03-11 19:33:49	dzwdz	the owner could
2022-03-11 19:33:54	dzwdz	it's not your fault
2022-03-11 19:34:09	dzwdz	and i'm assuming the norns is going to be repairable
2022-03-11 19:34:17	nihilazo	yeah it's built to be repairable
2022-03-11 19:34:25	nihilazo	I want to see what's actually happened to it
2022-03-11 19:34:28	dzwdz	don't
2022-03-11 19:34:30	dzwdz	seriously
2022-03-11 19:34:32	dzwdz	bad idea
2022-03-11 19:34:39	dzwdz	you'll risk actually fucking something up
2022-03-11 19:36:49	dzwdz	calm down and reach out to the owner
2022-03-11 19:36:51	dzwdz	once you're calm
2022-03-11 19:40:40	elly	https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/01/23/firecracker--start-a-vm-in-less-than-a-second/ wah this is so cool
2022-03-11 19:41:58	dzwdz	oooh
2022-03-11 19:42:19	dzwdz	so my first question was "is this even faster than qemu?" and there's a bunch of papers linked right below

2022-03-11 19:43:29	@vilmibm	how are all y'all?
2022-03-11 19:43:34	asm	good
2022-03-11 19:43:36	elly	I had left a question a couple of days ago about how the patreon is doing vs how much tilde.town costs to run and if we were still interested in hiring a contract sysadmin
2022-03-11 19:43:55	elly	I am doing well! today is theoretically a corp holiday but I am working and taking next friday off instead
2022-03-11 19:44:14	the_default	huh firecracker might finally be the solution to my crappy minecraft computer mod with real vms
2022-03-11 19:44:24	the_default	might try remaking it agai
2022-03-11 19:44:51	the_default	actually no it isn't
2022-03-11 19:44:54	the_default	i am stupid
2022-03-11 19:44:54	elly	A pared-down VMM
2022-03-11 19:44:55	elly	Firecracker began as a fork of Google's crosvm from ChromeOS.
2022-03-11 19:44:58	elly	aha! I was wondering
2022-03-11 19:45:10	dzwdz	inb4 you find out you were somehow involved
2022-03-11 19:45:17	@vilmibm	elly: oh i missed the question. right now the patreon covers our cost with about $40-60 leftover.
2022-03-11 19:45:28	elly	I am sure my code is running in this somewhere :)
2022-03-11 19:45:35	m455	vilmibm: i'm so excited about your next after-work adventure in life!!!
2022-03-11 19:45:37	elly	but crosvm is entirely rust so it would be via a library
2022-03-11 19:45:39	elly	vilmibm: awesome
2022-03-11 19:45:54	m455	elly: re: your code being there possibly: that's so awesome!!
2022-03-11 19:45:59	elly	haha
2022-03-11 19:46:00	@vilmibm	so hiring a person would be hard, but it's also an option that i just pay them out of my own pocket
2022-03-11 19:46:09	elly	some parts of chromium are very very widely reused
2022-03-11 19:46:16	elly	plus there are all those electron apps and such
2022-03-11 19:46:26	extratone	https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/hungo.png
2022-03-11 19:46:27	elly	vilmibm: yeah, I was going to offer to help pay for that if we had specific work we wanted to contract for
2022-03-11 19:46:34	@vilmibm	a post-GH path i'm considering is founding a non-profit which would make such money moving / employment much easier but that's not very short term.
2022-03-11 19:46:56	m455	elly: which language did you write the parts of chromeos in out of curiousity? i'm always interested in which langs are used behind the scenes of things lol
2022-03-11 19:47:02	elly	m455: C and C++
2022-03-11 19:47:09	m455	awesome!
2022-03-11 19:47:11	elly	the kernel work was all C, a lot of the userland was C++ but some of it was C too
2022-03-11 19:47:28	m455	fun! i should try out c++, i had tried out C a lot lately :D
2022-03-11 19:47:38	elly	C++ is a big language and not easy to learn, but useful to know
2022-03-11 19:47:48	dzwdz	o, what kind of kernel work did you do on chromeos?
2022-03-11 19:47:56	elly	I worked a bunch on cell modem drivers
2022-03-11 19:48:04	elly	incredibly dull code for the most part
2022-03-11 19:48:46	elly	also a little bit on dm-verity which is the hashed immutable rootfs thing chromeos uses
2022-03-11 19:49:01	elly	https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html this thing
2022-03-11 19:49:21	@vilmibm	elly: mm, i'm happy to talk more about it. i don't think i have a super clear idea of what the job desc would look like right now. off the top of my head, managing systemd units, some amount of work towards adding monitoring (as abuse prevention).
2022-03-11 19:49:23	dzwdz	from what i've seen the way you "root" chromeos is suprisingly reasonable
2022-03-11 19:49:29	dzwdz	with how you can rollback to a legit os
2022-03-11 19:49:37	@vilmibm	brb, grabbing my wife some coffee from the Outside
2022-03-11 19:49:39	dzwdz	a big step up from the android mess
2022-03-11 19:49:39	elly	dzwdz: well, you flip it into developer mode and then it stops verifying the rootfs or kernel image
2022-03-11 19:49:46	dzwdz	but you can flip back in, right?
2022-03-11 19:49:47	elly	and then you do what you want to it
2022-03-11 19:49:48	elly	you can
2022-03-11 19:49:59	elly	it will then stop booting your modified image
2022-03-11 19:50:21	dzwdz	and you also don't need to use any horrible bootloader unlock/shitty flashing utilities
2022-03-11 19:50:23	dzwdz	i assume
2022-03-11 19:50:27	elly	indeed you don't
2022-03-11 19:52:09	猫	how do I stop listening to mili help
2022-03-11 19:52:28	elly	they were designed to support that from the start because it makes a better product and also a better security story
2022-03-11 19:53:43	dzwdz	being able to rollback safely is big
2022-03-11 19:53:47	elly	since it takes "rootfs did not verify" from "very exceptional case" to "something that both users and developers will encounter in normal use" which means it gets tested a LOT more
2022-03-11 19:53:53	dzwdz	i hate how rooting a phone completely voids any trust you have in it
2022-03-11 19:54:02	elly	yeah indeed
2022-03-11 19:54:16	elly	one of the userland things I worked on was cryptohome, which is the service responsible for homedir encryption on chromeos
2022-03-11 19:54:36	elly	which does some imo pretty clever things to arrange for your homedir to be unrecoverably erased if you enter dev mode
2022-03-11 19:55:48	elly	namely, one of the keys used for encrypting the key used to encrypt your homedir is bound to the TPM's PCR state, so if you boot in dev mode, the PCR state is different and the TPM won't decrypt the key for you
2022-03-11 19:59:57	elly	https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/refs/heads/main/cryptohome/docs/decrypt.md hell yeah it's still here

2022-03-11 20:01:11	sotdbot	Done! Your song of the day has been updated to Mili - Salt, Pepper, Birds, and the Thought Police
2022-03-11 20:01:41	jmjl	elly: Do you think that was good for the users?
2022-03-11 20:01:54	elly	do I think what was
2022-03-11 20:02:04	elly	having developer mode? definitely yes
2022-03-11 20:02:22	jmjl	No the, not decrypting the key for you.
2022-03-11 20:02:27	elly	oh
2022-03-11 20:02:29	elly	yes
2022-03-11 20:02:59	elly	the intent behind that design was, doing it that way ensures that if someone gets ahold of your chromebook, they both have to compromise the physical TPM *and then* crack your password
2022-03-11 20:03:08	dzwdz	wait a sec, chromebooks have mandatory fde?
2022-03-11 20:03:10	dzwdz	that's dope
2022-03-11 20:03:14	elly	if it wasn't built that way, someone could flip it into dev mode, extract your hashed password, then crack it normally
2022-03-11 20:03:41	elly	dzwdz: they don't do FDE - they have encrypted homedirs and an unencrypted but immutable rootfs
2022-03-11 20:03:48	elly	so not "FD"E
2022-03-11 20:03:49	jmjl	Oh, I thinked that was making it so that in dev mode you couldn't decrypt the files in any way.
2022-03-11 20:03:51	elly	but all user data is encrypted
2022-03-11 20:04:17	elly	jmjl: hm, I actually am unsure :)
2022-03-11 20:04:21	elly	it's been a long while
2022-03-11 20:04:35	jmjl	But that's on the open source chromebooks?
2022-03-11 20:04:39	elly	sure
2022-03-11 20:05:10	jmjl	Oh, also could anyone setup any other os different than chromeos in the chromebooks?
2022-03-11 20:05:12	elly	yeah, I don't know what the current state of things is, there are mentions in this doc of stuff that postdates me
2022-03-11 20:05:23	elly	jmjl: sure, in developer mode they are normalish linux laptops
2022-03-11 20:05:27	elly	you can boot whatever on them
2022-03-11 20:06:08	jmjl	Oh, do you think the hardware is good?
2022-03-11 20:06:16	elly	mostly no, but it is cheap
2022-03-11 20:06:30	elly	and all well-supported by linux :P
2022-03-11 20:06:54	jmjl	great, because I like cheap things that are well-supported by linux.
2022-03-11 20:07:33	jmjl	https://wiki.512mb.org/en/installing-linux-on-chromebooks. Found a guide of how to do it.
2022-03-11 20:09:30	elly	the bios wipe part in this guide is what trashes the keys in the TPM I think, but after you do it you could install new keys and use them to do homedir encryption the same way
2022-03-11 20:09:38	elly	you just wouldn't be able to recover the data that was there before
2022-03-11 20:09:59	elly	very much not sure though
2022-03-11 20:10:30	jmjl	Any chromebook works, right?
2022-03-11 20:10:38	elly	no idea
2022-03-11 20:10:43	dzwdz	the kid ones are suspiciously cheap
2022-03-11 20:10:56	elly	some of the lower-end ones are *really* low end, hardware wise
2022-03-11 20:11:01	elly	like, pretty bad displays, small disks
2022-03-11 20:13:30	jmjl	But I think it would be better to buy a thinkpad if whe get to those levels.
2022-03-11 20:13:40	the_default	(oh no that didn't do a dry run like i thought it would. oh few it did what i wanted anyway)
2022-03-11 20:13:47	the_default	s/few/phew
2022-03-11 20:13:47	sedbot	<the_default> (oh no that didn't do a dry run like i thought it would. oh phew it did what i wanted anyway)
2022-03-11 20:13:55	adminbot	***** PSA: https://github.com/ergochat/ergo/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.md#why-is-ergo-ignoring-my-ident-response--user-command cc jmjl
2022-03-11 20:14:08	jmjl	Thanks adminbot
2022-03-11 20:14:11	elly	to be honest if you want to run linux on a laptop there are probably better choices
2022-03-11 20:14:18	elly	chromebooks only really make sense if you want chromeos
2022-03-11 20:15:49	jmjl	But it still does not make sense when you have bots like minerober that limit how many things can be said at once
2022-03-11 20:16:28	archangelic	when I went chromebook shopping, i looked for one that had an IPS display because so many are using 00's era tft panels
2022-03-11 20:16:51	archangelic	(or it was the other way around, I don't remember)
2022-03-11 20:17:06	elly	a lot of them are quite literally the cheapest hardware that works
2022-03-11 20:17:23	archangelic	I just know I ended up spending more money for one, then they promised linux would work, but several chrome updates killed the linux vm
2022-03-11 20:17:28	archangelic	and it became untenable
2022-03-11 20:17:29	elly	rip
2022-03-11 20:17:44	elly	the linux vm works on my current pixelbook
2022-03-11 20:18:14	archangelic	I ended up just saving the money and buying an M1 macbook air which has a fucking great display, great processor, fanless, light, and runs a solid OS
2022-03-11 20:18:34	elly	highly valid
2022-03-11 20:18:42	archangelic	It's not linux, but the pc laptop market is filled with trash
2022-03-11 20:18:51	elly	those are a good 4-5x more expensive than the bottom end chromebooks
2022-03-11 20:18:58	archangelic	absolutely
2022-03-11 20:19:06	archangelic	well, not really
2022-03-11 20:19:17	archangelic	I spent 400 on an okay chromebook, and got my air for 850
2022-03-11 20:19:21	the_default	i'm still disappointed sleep just doesn't work with my laptop. but i can't switch back to windows (and i can't sell it, not technically mine)
2022-03-11 20:19:22	archangelic	so a little over 2x
2022-03-11 20:19:26	archangelic	but still
2022-03-11 20:19:28	elly	oh wow, that is a pretty good price on an M1 macbook
2022-03-11 20:19:38	archangelic	buy it refurbed
2022-03-11 20:19:40	jmjl	I'm just using a laptop under a monitor and a keyboard.
2022-03-11 20:19:43	elly	oh, yeah
2022-03-11 20:19:46	@vilmibm	my work just sent me a thinkpad x1 extreme and so far i think i like it >_>
2022-03-11 20:19:53	jmjl	great
2022-03-11 20:19:58	archangelic	that's awesome
2022-03-11 20:20:06	@vilmibm	it's very light for being 16 inches and has good speakers/touchpad
2022-03-11 20:20:19	jmjl	elly: Are you running ChromeOs?
2022-03-11 20:20:19	@vilmibm	32gb of ram and a mobo that switches from integrated graphics to a 1650ti
2022-03-11 20:20:27	archangelic	oh shit
2022-03-11 20:20:28	elly	jmjl: on my pixelbook? yes
2022-03-11 20:20:36	@vilmibm	sadly running linux on it would be a huge pain but i'll just use WSL2
2022-03-11 20:20:40	jmjl	interesting, does it support linugx.
2022-03-11 20:20:50	dzwdz	what would you even need the 1650ti for?
2022-03-11 20:20:52	the_default	oh wow, that sounds great
2022-03-11 20:21:10	dzwdz	or is it not only a work laptop
2022-03-11 20:21:23	@vilmibm	i mean i think my boss was just like "send him a thinkpad with decent specs" and that is what showed up
2022-03-11 20:21:24	elly	jmjl: yeah but I want it to run chromeos
2022-03-11 20:21:29	jmjl	Still when you get that huge pain done you would not need windoze.
2022-03-11 20:21:29	@vilmibm	def don't need a GPU to compile my Golang CLI app
2022-03-11 20:21:44	dzwdz	modern iGPUs are actually pretty damn strong
2022-03-11 20:22:11	dzwdz	i was worried when i was buying my laptop about the igpu, but it's smooth as butter for 2d image editing
2022-03-11 20:22:16	dzwdz	and i don't care about much more than that
2022-03-11 20:22:21	archangelic	vilmibm: you needed a hammer, they sent a whole toolbox
2022-03-11 20:22:45	@vilmibm	yes
2022-03-11 20:23:00	@vilmibm	they also sent me an m1 mac book pro 13in (bc i have to do cross platform work) which i expected to like more than i do
2022-03-11 20:23:21	@vilmibm	it literally doesn't work with my dock (external screen just turns on and off forever)
2022-03-11 20:23:46	archangelic	oh, yeah, thunderbolt is a maze of compatibility issues
2022-03-11 20:23:54	archangelic	and the 13in pro is... not good
2022-03-11 20:24:13	archangelic	the 14 in pro is better and has an actual better processor
2022-03-11 20:25:02	archangelic	my PCs that have thunderbolt don't work with anything that works with my mac, and I just don't get it. I feel like it's a licensed system that only mac cares about full features of
2022-03-11 20:25:08	@vilmibm	archangelic: yeah the 14 in one looks rad as hell
2022-03-11 20:25:14	@vilmibm	and i was hoping he was sending me that lol
2022-03-11 20:25:17	@vilmibm	but i got the maligned 13 inch.
2022-03-11 20:25:17	elly	archangelic: I think it feels like that because that is precisely what it is
2022-03-11 20:25:36	elly	everyone else is all in on USB & DisplayPort or whatever
2022-03-11 20:26:18	jmjl	I am not in.
2022-03-11 20:26:40	elly	by "everyone else" I mean computer manufacturers
2022-03-11 20:26:43	elly	not necessarily you
2022-03-11 20:27:15	archangelic	displayport has dedicated channels on the thunderbolt spec, but so many docks and accessories want the full bluetooth band
2022-03-11 20:27:21	archangelic	not bluetooth
2022-03-11 20:27:21	archangelic	god
2022-03-11 20:27:24	archangelic	thunderbolt
2022-03-11 20:27:40	archangelic	and if something doesn't pass the vibe check, it just fails
2022-03-11 20:28:22	@vilmibm	this is why i am particularly mad at the m1 pro: i bought a dock, at significant mark up, that was recommended by apple years ago as fully compatible with mac stuff
2022-03-11 20:28:24	elly	I'm gonna start calling my debugging functions that consistency check a data structure "vibe_check"
2022-03-11 20:28:54	archangelic	all computers are just vibes and marketing
2022-03-11 20:28:55	@vilmibm	it worked great with my curren mbp
2022-03-11 20:29:03	@vilmibm	and fails miserably with the m1 mbp
2022-03-11 20:29:05	@vilmibm	current*
2022-03-11 20:29:07	archangelic	oh, that's wild...
2022-03-11 20:29:16	@vilmibm	i googled around and it's a common problem :C
2022-03-11 20:29:41	archangelic	is that one of the ones where one side was full thunderbolt and one side of ports was just usb-c? I know one gen of the 13in did that...
2022-03-11 20:29:46	@vilmibm	the butterfly keyboard + touchbar + heating issues on this thing means i will not stick with it post-GH and intend to just use the x1 extreme (x1x? x1ex?) full time anyway
2022-03-11 20:29:58	archangelic	makes sense
2022-03-11 20:30:06	elly	wait do you get to keep your work laptop after you leave?
2022-03-11 20:30:15	@vilmibm	elly: yeah, i just have to pay taxes on them
2022-03-11 20:30:21	elly	aha
2022-03-11 20:30:42	archangelic	oh damn, I wish symantec had let me keep mine...
2022-03-11 20:30:49	archangelic	but security theater and whatnot
2022-03-11 20:31:14	elly	we don't get to keep ours either
2022-03-11 20:31:15	archangelic	the security company that is beta testing using customers as bitcoin miners
2022-03-11 20:31:25	archangelic	so glad I got booted before that move
2022-03-11 20:31:25	elly	I don't think it's theater really, they just want to make sure it gets erased properly :P
2022-03-11 20:31:39	archangelic	I mean, they could just erase it and give it to me lol
2022-03-11 20:31:44	elly	oh yeah
2022-03-11 20:31:55	elly	I guess I could mail mine in, get it erased and de-enterprised, then get it back if I asked
2022-03-11 20:32:18	archangelic	Oh, I worked at an office at that point, I literally gave the machine to a person in an office
2022-03-11 20:34:18	login	apple has so much money, why can't they make things "just work" with products they themselves recommended?
2022-03-11 20:34:27	login	it harms their brand even more, doesn't it
2022-03-11 20:34:39	login	and isn't that where most of the 'apple premium' comes from?
2022-03-11 20:34:56	archangelic	because at the end of the day, thunderbolt is just a marketing/licensing thing from intel
2022-03-11 20:35:09	archangelic	it's still capitalism at its worst
2022-03-11 20:35:36	archangelic	and as someone who has used apple products for years, it's just kind of how things on the mac have always been
2022-03-11 20:35:51	archangelic	so nothing is going to change about a few recommended products not working great
2022-03-11 20:36:10	archangelic	the mac has been second-class since the iphone, and that's mostly fine, but it kinda sucks
2022-03-11 20:36:31	archangelic	and the move to ARM is definitely going to have some pains
2022-03-11 20:37:08	archangelic	I do have less compatibility issues than I have with various PCs i've used, but there are still bumps
2022-03-11 20:37:49	login	it's like using icloud for your email
2022-03-11 20:37:59	@vilmibm	the mac ARM experience has been more pleasant than the msft surface pro x ARM experience but I think I'm comfortable waiting a few years on ARM anyway
2022-03-11 20:38:01	archangelic	I worked on a team that had a mix of windows and mac users, and the windows users had way more issues with our stack than we did
2022-03-11 20:38:29	login	so it's the choice between bad and worse
2022-03-11 20:39:01	archangelic	I think you're being intentionally inflammatory
2022-03-11 20:39:22	archangelic	computers suck, sometimes for certain things, they suck less
2022-03-11 20:40:28	elly	I hear that sentiment a lot but do not really vibe with it
2022-03-11 20:40:33	elly	computers are hella cool and awesome
2022-03-11 20:40:58	@vilmibm	well, computers are certainly chaotic and unpredictable
2022-03-11 20:41:05	@vilmibm	which leads to frustration
2022-03-11 20:41:05	login	the monitor thing is pretty awful though; they do check compatibility with products they themselves recommended right?
2022-03-11 20:41:18	@vilmibm	login: the dock was recommended back in like 2017/2018
2022-03-11 20:41:19	login	they should at least do that
2022-03-11 20:41:25	@vilmibm	so for all i know they no longer recommend it.
2022-03-11 20:42:00	login	i am using a mid-2012 apple laptop; i no longer upgrade the OS either (i use windows on it now)
2022-03-11 20:42:20	@vilmibm	my long view of being old and now having spent significant time working in mac/windows/linux environments is: there will be failure, complexity, frustration, confusion on any platform because of how much complexity humans have layed on top of the humble CPU
2022-03-11 20:42:24	lown	belatedly, jmjl: i tried to install linux on a google pixel, it was a lot of work and it was quite broken
2022-03-11 20:42:37	lown	do i mean pixel?
2022-03-11 20:42:46	lown	google's own chromebook
2022-03-11 20:42:53	login	pixelbook
2022-03-11 20:42:54	elly	the original Pixel from 2013?
2022-03-11 20:42:57	elly	or the Pixelbook
2022-03-11 20:42:57	lown	pixelbook
2022-03-11 20:42:58	elly	ah yeah
2022-03-11 20:43:06	archangelic	I second vilmibm's sentiment
2022-03-11 20:43:07	elly	the Pixelbook is a pretty weird item hardware wise
2022-03-11 20:43:16	lown	but that's just one experience; the pixelbook was quite a strange lapt-
2022-03-11 20:43:16	login	pixel was the laptop, but now it's the hphone?
2022-03-11 20:43:16	elly	I've never tried to put another linux on mine
2022-03-11 20:43:18	jmjl	pixelbook or pixelbook go?
2022-03-11 20:43:18	lown	^^
2022-03-11 20:43:25	elly	regular pixelbook for me
2022-03-11 20:43:33	lown	pixelbook go I think.
2022-03-11 20:43:34	elly	login: god don't remind me
2022-03-11 20:43:48	login	i don't recall either
2022-03-11 20:43:59	elly	[google product manager] "I think we'll call it... 'Pixel'." "Daring today, aren't we?"
2022-03-11 20:44:09	lown	i tried installing the specific chromebook distro's out there
2022-03-11 20:44:12	login	I mean, gPhone would have worked fine
2022-03-11 20:44:56	lown	Should've just kept adding 's'-es on the end depending on what version they were at
2022-03-11 20:45:03	lown	Google Pixelsssss
2022-03-11 20:46:13	login	My speculation is, they will eventually do P1xel, P2xel, Pnxel
2022-03-11 20:46:15	jmjl	//exec python -c 'print('Google Pixel {}'.format(200*'s')). Whe are launching it.
2022-03-11 20:46:33	login	^ it will be made of cardboard right?
2022-03-11 20:46:37	dzwdz	P1x3l
2022-03-11 20:46:48	dzwdz	xx_P1x3l_xx
2022-03-11 20:47:04	login	if they made an unlocked phone that can run linux and is a full computer, they can call that the P1x3l
2022-03-11 20:47:38	archangelic	didn't canonical try to do that?
2022-03-11 20:47:52	archangelic	like that was half the point of the Unity project
2022-03-11 20:48:00	jmjl	No, it will be made of plastic, using magnetic switches actioned by mechanical systems.
2022-03-11 20:48:55	login	it's not a profitable product,  but it can increase reputation
2022-03-11 20:48:57	jmjl	You thinked cardboard, but if whe go to landfills take the plastic(maybe with permssion, or without it) and make a phone with that it will get better reputation
2022-03-11 20:49:23	login	you know, how many carbon credits can i get if i do that?
2022-03-11 20:50:43	@vilmibm	canonical tried
2022-03-11 20:50:49	@vilmibm	it didn't go anywhere
2022-03-11 20:50:52	@vilmibm	hell, mozilla tried
2022-03-11 20:51:02	@vilmibm	i think in a bin somewhere i might still have my gecko phone?
2022-03-11 20:51:28	elly	the pinephone folks too
2022-03-11 20:51:37	elly	it's been tried a handful of times over the years
2022-03-11 20:51:53	@vilmibm	ah yeah
2022-03-11 20:52:00	elly	there just aren't enough people that want it to make it a worthwhile commercial endeavor
2022-03-11 20:52:21	login	but google didn't try it
2022-03-11 20:53:18	elly	I don't really know why google would want to
2022-03-11 20:53:19	login	phones are still in the 'amiga' phase, no standardised components and drivers
2022-03-11 20:53:46	login	i don't think there will be interoprability without some kind of regulatory prodding
2022-03-11 20:53:54	@vilmibm	which seems highly unlikely
2022-03-11 20:54:11	jmjl	But also that most people now only have phones seems kinda rare
2022-03-11 20:54:12	elly	I don't know what it would even mean to have interoperability
2022-03-11 20:54:18	login	it seems like the only option left is reverse-engineering, but their security chip even rejects that
2022-03-11 20:54:21	elly	jmjl: hm?
2022-03-11 20:54:42	login	it's rare that most people have only phones
2022-03-11 20:54:54	elly	it is rare in rich countries
2022-03-11 20:54:59	login	exactly
2022-03-11 20:55:07	elly	it is very common on less rich countries
2022-03-11 20:55:10	jmjl	I'm refering that most people that live in this world in rich contries only use phones.
2022-03-11 20:55:18	elly	what?
2022-03-11 20:55:30	elly	most people in rich countries have both a phone and another device
2022-03-11 20:55:53	jmjl	A tablet?
2022-03-11 20:55:54	login	have vs use
2022-03-11 20:55:57	elly	sure, or a laptop
2022-03-11 20:56:09	extratone	and probably a billion other other devices that they just leave on, unused, for months at a time.
2022-03-11 20:56:13	login	only might not be true, but mostly is probably true
2022-03-11 20:56:17	jmjl	Yep.
2022-03-11 20:56:30	elly	ah hm
2022-03-11 20:56:35	elly	I'm not sure about actual time in use
2022-03-11 20:56:55	login	it's sad that the full computing platform on phones is not unlocked for those who only have phones as their one device
2022-03-11 20:57:21	extratone	speaking of which I'm gonna get off my butt and go see if I can get in a car accident see ya later town. S t a y  m o b i l e

2022-03-11 22:16:31	extratone	howdy town I'm sorry if my leaving comment was insensitive it just occured to me. 
2022-03-11 22:16:42	extratone	that said, I was unsuccessful.
2022-03-11 22:16:57	lown	On the note of on-the-go SSH management, archangelic, what about that DevTerm?
2022-03-11 22:17:23	@archangelic	I'm a filthy iphone user
2022-03-11 22:17:39	lown	Yeah but. It's pretty
2022-03-11 22:17:41	lown	https://www.clockworkpi.com/devterm
2022-03-11 22:17:54	lown	Expensive? yes
2022-03-11 22:17:56	@archangelic	Oh, i thought you were talking about a feature
2022-03-11 22:17:58	asm	what was your leaving comment?
2022-03-11 22:18:00	@archangelic	hell yes, I want these
2022-03-11 22:18:01	lown	Too expensive? probably
2022-03-11 22:18:10	lown	But also, pretty.
2022-03-11 22:18:16	asm	oh
2022-03-11 22:18:16	@archangelic	Or I was thinking about hooking a rpi to a dot matrix printer
2022-03-11 22:18:21	@archangelic	probably just as expensive
2022-03-11 22:18:34	lown	I really like the thermal printer thing, not gonna lie
2022-03-11 22:18:43	@archangelic	thermal printers are so fun
2022-03-11 22:18:50	@archangelic	I spent too long in POS support
2022-03-11 22:18:55	@archangelic	thermals are so fun
2022-03-11 22:19:48	lown	Extremely into the retrofuture where instead of giving someone your business card, you pull out your devterm and thermal print them your contact details
2022-03-11 22:20:09	@archangelic	lol, our test bench at one job had a power supply for a thermal printer for static cling stickers, but the post it used worked for print servers (make a parallel printer networked) so we put a big skull on it because it would explode the print servers
2022-03-11 22:20:41	lown	That's beautiful
2022-03-11 22:21:35	@archangelic	the funny part is that we learned because the end users exploded a bunch of print servers over the years
2022-03-11 22:21:40	lown	I saw a post someone made about their homelab and someone commented saying that it looked much more professional than many actual business server racks and then someone else said that one place they worked, the server lived in a corner of the conference room and someone unplugged it to plug in a projector
2022-03-11 22:21:56	@archangelic	full on tracks
2022-03-11 22:22:10	@archangelic	I'm a professinal and I would do something like that if I needed a projector
2022-03-11 22:22:25	lown	quite right too, when you gotta project you gotta project
2022-03-11 22:23:50	lown	oh on the note of monstrosities using 18650 batteries, there's also this which i admit i really really want even though it is completely not what i need
2022-03-11 22:24:02	lown	https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform
2022-03-11 22:24:27	lown	it's a rechargeable brick which also happens to run Linux
2022-03-11 22:24:32	lown	and i love it
2022-03-11 22:26:23	lown	it's got a tiny status oled screen! and a trackball! and a mechanical keyboard!
2022-03-11 22:26:56	nihilazo	I love the reform in theory
2022-03-11 22:27:00	nihilazo	I would hate it in practice
2022-03-11 22:27:05	lown	same same
2022-03-11 22:27:08	nihilazo	because it's just so huge
2022-03-11 22:27:18	nihilazo	and has a distinct lack of any kind of real software support
2022-03-11 22:27:18	nihilazo	etc
2022-03-11 22:27:22	nihilazo	but it's a really nice idea
2022-03-11 22:28:08	lown	well, it's a linux computer running Debian on ARM, the software wouldn't be my main concern
2022-03-11 22:28:43	citrons	if it runs debian, then it's software support would certainly not be a problem
2022-03-11 22:29:13	citrons	for me, at least. I haven't heard of this device before
2022-03-11 22:29:51	lown	it does, and all the component drivers are open source
2022-03-11 22:29:58	nihilazo	why do I feel like all my money is going on repairing things rn
2022-03-11 22:30:02	nihilazo	I want to repair my mp3 player
2022-03-11 22:30:07	nihilazo	but buying the parts has a hefty order fee
2022-03-11 22:30:08	citrons	laptops are seriously lacking in thickness. this means that they have horrible thermal performance as a result. and they thus destroy themselves
2022-03-11 22:30:13	nihilazo	and it might not even work
2022-03-11 22:30:28	nihilazo	and I want to get this norns repaired but it's not even mine and there's no way I could even afford the repair at all
2022-03-11 22:30:52	lown	my main concern is sometimes i wanna unwind and binge watch grey's anatomy, and i'm not sure that a laptop like this would be able to do even do that
2022-03-11 22:30:55	nihilazo	I could just give up and buy another cheap mp3 player, it'd do what I want and be cheaper than repairing my current one. But I don't want to do that because it's shitty to cause more e-waste when it can be saved

2022-03-12 00:28:51	extratone	this is the best read I’ve come across in a long time. https://audacity.substack.com/p/the-ladies-room
2022-03-12 00:32:11	m455	extratone: wow this is so good so far
2022-03-12 00:40:02	m455	i really enjoyed that, thanks!
2022-03-12 00:40:11	elly	what's it about?
2022-03-12 00:40:11	extratone	they just followed me on Twitter and I am straight up no joke tempted to be like "I can almost promise you will not enjoy my content."
2022-03-12 00:41:35	extratone	well, m455, I'm glad you liked it. do you have an answer for what it's about because I do not have a concise one.
2022-03-12 00:41:53	m455	extratone: yeah i think i do
2022-03-12 00:42:10	extratone	it is about gender in america, you could say.
2022-03-12 00:42:44	astrinaut	gender in america is weird
2022-03-12 00:42:52	elly	right but what does it have to say about it
2022-03-12 00:42:57	m455	elly: it's about a trans binary person, and it's almost like a mini self-ethnography (auto-ethnography? haha) of some of their encounters when using public restrooms
2022-03-12 00:43:12	elly	ah, neat!
2022-03-12 00:43:16	astrinaut	it's more musing than making a point, i'd say
2022-03-12 00:43:39	m455	it talks about what people have said to them, how they felt about it, and what they have to (unfortunately) do to deal with it sometimes when they have the energy
2022-03-12 00:43:50	m455	yeah, astrinaut hit it on spot
2022-03-12 00:44:14	m455	it creates empathy when i read it
2022-03-12 00:44:19	m455	as in my empathy for them
2022-03-12 00:50:15	extratone	thank you both. y'all are pretty great.
2022-03-12 00:52:36	astrinaut	oh there's more words. i spaced out after a couple screenfuls.
2022-03-12 00:52:40	@natalia	the latter half of this essay is confusing me
2022-03-12 00:53:51	m455	after the bathroom discussion it was hard to follow
2022-03-12 00:57:20	@natalia	most of that mostly just felt like it was directed towards cis people (okay!) and i didn't get a lot out of it
2022-03-12 00:58:21	@natalia	and then the latter half presents a sort of incoherent view of everything
2022-03-12 00:59:26	m455	yeah the last half was an extreme topic shift haha, i really liked the first half though
2022-03-12 01:01:10	@natalia	i read something like "I also hope that the current backlash against transgender people will soon go the way of the marriage equality fight in the aughts. I hope in ten years, trans people can just be normal people."
2022-03-12 01:01:18	@natalia	and it's like, i dunno, do i live in the same world as this article
2022-03-12 01:02:49	extratone	Ï guess it felt so powerful because I live in the same world as my family, for whom this essay would be extremely contentious
2022-03-12 01:03:20	extratone	if I could get them to just acknowledge any of the arguments are legitimate arguments.
2022-03-12 01:03:23	m455	this is the kind of article that iwould get in heated fights with my mom about
2022-03-12 01:04:35	extratone	yeah my family's new thing is basically questioning suffrage? lmao
2022-03-12 01:04:51	extratone	we goin all the way back.
2022-03-12 01:05:35	astrinaut	suffrage: CANCELED
2022-03-12 01:07:28	m455	lol
2022-03-12 01:11:06	login	if it seeps into their professional life, it will have consequences
2022-03-12 01:13:01	@natalia	i mean like, maybe?
2022-03-12 01:15:29	@natalia	all of the main inflictors of transphobic violence in my life would/do suffer none, loud or not
2022-03-12 01:17:24	m455	straight people have it so easy going in the workplace in my opinion
2022-03-12 01:21:44	@archangelic	(I'm going to be overly broad here) I think the problem with looking at trans issues in the light of "we'll look back on this time and see that we overcame" is that we could have overcome from the start, the groups that fought for marriage equality promised that they would fight for trans rights, and we are seeing how they just left us to fend for ourselves while the bigots realized we were vulnerable.
2022-03-12 01:22:40	@archangelic	trans people could have and should have been given protections decades ago, god only knows we shouted and screamed for it during that time, but were largely left out of the whole conversation
2022-03-12 01:22:54	m455	that's such a good point
2022-03-12 01:23:19	@archangelic	I basically feel that we should have never gotten here in the first place. We (trans people) saw this coming 100 miles away.
2022-03-12 01:23:58	m455	yeah that's so fucked
2022-03-12 01:24:10	@archangelic	If we only say "love is love" but leave out a deconstruction of gender, we failed trans people.
2022-03-12 01:24:56	@archangelic	I gotta cook and not be an angry trans on the internet
2022-03-12 01:25:20	@archangelic	I didn't read the piece, but saw the sentiment in the chat, and had to just vent a minute
2022-03-12 01:25:50	m455	archangelic: i appreciated it archangelic <3
2022-03-12 01:26:24	@archangelic	transphobia, even to the level that we are seeing right now, is not new, it's not even more powerful, it's just more focused on us now.

2022-03-13 23:04:21	@vilmibm	is your name musically themed?
2022-03-13 23:05:16	extratone	it is! the Japanese hardcore subgenre, yes.
2022-03-13 23:05:35	extratone	I named my online magazine after extratone and since it went defunct, I kindof just adopted the name.
2022-03-13 23:06:10	extratone	thanks for adding my new key so I could actually get into town, btw.
2022-03-13 23:07:03	@vilmibm	sure! sorry for what i assume was a prolonged wait
2022-03-13 23:07:10	@vilmibm	and cool! i was unaware of the genre
2022-03-13 23:07:37	extratone	also thanked you in this guide I’m working on but you don’t have to say you’re welcome. https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink
2022-03-13 23:08:05	extratone	it's defined by a BPM so high that kicks begin to form an indistinguishable tone.
2022-03-13 23:09:10	agafnd	that'd just be fast subdivisions, not fast bpm, right?
2022-03-13 23:09:16	agafnd	well presumably fast bpm also

2022-03-13 23:09:31	asm	oops
2022-03-13 23:10:18	extratone	I don't actually know anything about music, but I assume you're correct.

2022-03-13 23:11:18	extratone	to be honest, not really - I can find some but Bandcamp's explainer is probably a good place to start (give me a sec.)

2022-03-13 23:13:53	agafnd	yeah it's funny to me to describe that as "1000 or even 10000 BPM"

2022-03-13 23:14:06	agafnd	cause like a 'beat' to me is something that can be felt and responded to
2022-03-13 23:14:15	@vilmibm	i'm a big fan of /dev/null and i guess you could call that some kind of breakcore https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aL6OUqLJy0&list=PLeddF0N3V2BRJsOggGHokW4jkCz7JMyaW

2022-03-13 23:15:20	agafnd	i think the fastest bpm i've heard played for reals is in that one live recording of "anthropology" by charlie parker
2022-03-13 23:15:28	@vilmibm	agafnd: i think it's a useful distinction though -- an artist making music with a sequencer running at an absurd BPM will make something different than one using, say, sustained synthesizer tones
2022-03-13 23:15:28	agafnd	which is something like 350 or 400 bpm
2022-03-13 23:16:14	agafnd	vilmibm: true
2022-03-13 23:16:21	extratone	oh my god this sounds like [what's his name]>>>>>> I will think of it someday.
2022-03-13 23:16:27	agafnd	i'd still call it like, 256th notes or whatever lol
2022-03-13 23:16:35	@vilmibm	haha fair

2022-03-13 23:20:49	@vilmibm	hehehe i was just at No Fun Fest 07 a heady fucking year
2022-03-13 23:21:22	@vilmibm	my friend's friend was merzbow's handler/translator and he got to actually go to a diner that would serve vegan food after with merzbow. i did not get to go lol
2022-03-13 23:22:19	@vilmibm	merzbow live is a thing you feel more in your sternum than your ears
2022-03-13 23:22:20	extratone	damn.

2022-03-13 23:23:24	@vilmibm	i was like. 19? and was thinking "cool i'll do this shit every year and life is good"
2022-03-13 23:23:33	@vilmibm	i went to part of 08 and then that was it for No Fun Fest in USA

2022-03-13 23:27:07	flowercorpse	and Sachiko M althought that's maybe the opposite of noise
2022-03-13 23:27:14	@vilmibm	sachiko m is wonderful
2022-03-13 23:27:34	@vilmibm	do you like sawako? or toshimaru nakamura?
2022-03-13 23:28:45	flowercorpse	I haven't listened to sawako, I like toshimaru nakamura
2022-03-13 23:29:36	@vilmibm	oh Hijokaidan is great too, I love their show with Borbetomagus, Both Noises End Burning, but sadly it does not appear to be on youtube. i have it on CD somewhere
2022-03-13 23:29:46	@vilmibm	sawako is v soft lovely field recording stuff
2022-03-13 23:29:50	@vilmibm	i'm a huuuge fan

2022-03-13 23:30:24	@vilmibm	i do not!
2022-03-13 23:31:02	@vilmibm	(btw i have resolved to use this laptop until the battery dies so i'll abruptly disappear at some point)
2022-03-13 23:31:19	flowercorpse	their self titled is pretty cool, although pretty depressing
2022-03-13 23:31:26	@vilmibm	i'll check it out
2022-03-13 23:31:27	flowercorpse	kinda like Earth
2022-03-13 23:31:31	flowercorpse	but its a different band
2022-03-13 23:31:33	flowercorpse	somehow
2022-03-13 23:32:15	@vilmibm	hehe i do like Earth
2022-03-13 23:32:25	@vilmibm	...and that's what came up when i tried youtube. i'll check soulseek later
2022-03-13 23:32:51	@vilmibm	i'm a huge fan of Dylan Carlson, i got to see him at Big Ears Fest once
2022-03-13 23:33:35	@vilmibm	minor self promotion, my newest album exists on bandcamp. i started out heavily influence by sawako and fennesz and ended up just making harsh noise bc that's what i am https://graveyard-theory.bandcamp.com/releases
2022-03-13 23:34:59	flowercorpse	I also like the japanese free improv scene, there are a lot of overlaps with the noise scene, like Masayuki Takayanagi
2022-03-13 23:35:12	flowercorpse	vilmibm: I'll check it out:)
2022-03-13 23:36:20	@vilmibm	<3
2022-03-13 23:36:28	@vilmibm	i'm unfamiliar with free improv
2022-03-13 23:39:42	flowercorpse	Derek Bailey is a good starting point
2022-03-13 23:40:16	flowercorpse	and also because there are a lot of collaborations in free improv it's really easy to discover new artists
2022-03-14 00:35:05	extratone	any of y’all used Threema before? anything to say about it?

2022-03-14 01:34:07	extratone	my friend keeps insisting I write about it but idk
2022-03-14 01:34:43	extratone	privacy is a subject on which I have very few constructive things to say.
2022-03-14 01:38:04	mhj	Do you use it? From reading about it, I think it could be useful
2022-03-14 01:50:33	extratone	I haven't tried it yet. I know it's ridiculous but the iOS app is $3.99 and I already spend far too much on apps...

2022-03-14 02:06:49	m455	malvarma: ohhhhh interesting! it's sunday 10pm for me here, so far i only notice tildes being busy during the workday/work hours of 9-5 LOL
2022-03-14 02:09:11	asm	I never noticed this before, but for some reason my university's list of supported browsers for its PeopleSoft Enterprise Portal software says Firegox on Windows isn't recommended, but Firefox for "Linux" is recommended at the same time
2022-03-14 02:09:20	asm	firefox*
2022-03-14 02:09:30	malvarma	oh gee i should visit town during working hours
2022-03-14 02:09:58	malvarma	that would be a good way to pretend to work, which is what i get paid to do
2022-03-14 02:10:39	malvarma	i was not aware there was a difference between firefox on windows vs linux
2022-03-14 02:10:47	asm	same
2022-03-14 02:11:14	asm	only Google Chrome is recommended by the university for Windows -- not even edge or ie lol
2022-03-14 02:11:41	malvarma	though i have heard the amiga version has better music and more arcade-perfect color palettes than the spectrum port
2022-03-14 02:11:41	extratone	I mean, if you're going to be using Chromium anyway, I guess...
2022-03-14 02:12:30	malvarma	that is so not fair to the microsoft fan community
2022-03-14 02:13:47	malvarma	every time i see a list of supported browsers, and the list is more than just a roundup of recent versions of fairly popular browsers, i see a crime scene (and the victim is progressive enhancement)
2022-03-14 02:14:57	malvarma	na i kid though, it could also be the browser's fault.
2022-03-14 02:16:05	malvarma	i thought firefox was pretty up to date with standards compliance though. and we are still lightyears beyond the whole IE6 fiasco. i hope browsers don't repeat that mistake
2022-03-14 02:19:29	asm	doesn't Google have some of their own people in WHATWG? it seems like they can always just add themselves into the living draft of HTML5 that way
2022-03-14 02:21:25	malvarma	i thought mozilla, microsoft, and apple also had a seat at that table
2022-03-14 02:21:55	asm	I think they do, but they also don't make the most used browser lol
2022-03-14 02:21:59	malvarma	but somehow we still get new stuff that works differently between the browser

2022-03-14 02:26:48	malvarma	hmm, while i support your dog's choice to do body mods, im afraid i'm not ready to adopt howdy as a greeting. but i think when others use it, its charming
2022-03-14 02:27:35	katie	the people around where i grew up tended to use it fairly liberally and i always resented it until i realized i'd adopted it without noticing
2022-03-14 02:28:02	 *	asm didn't pay the license fee, and p*rated it instead
2022-03-14 02:28:50	katie	that's just what you think, asm. the fee is always paid, though maybe not always in cash.

2022-03-14 02:32:00	malvarma	asm: i see the flag and then the skull, but that could be my terminal emulator's fault
2022-03-14 02:32:10	katie	i see ircII absolutely imploding trying to substitute your characters for some reason
2022-03-14 02:33:09	asm	demoji said it's a pirate flag, but it's a black flag and skull and crossbones with a zero-width joiner placed in between the two
2022-03-14 02:33:23	asm	which is the right character combination for a pirate flag lol

2022-03-14 02:46:20	malvarma	hmm, what sort of free jazz
2022-03-14 02:46:43	@natalia	royalty free (jokes)
2022-03-14 02:47:17	malvarma	that means pharao sandards is ruled out
2022-03-14 02:47:18	katie	royalty-produced jazz sounds a lot more interesting than royalty-free
2022-03-14 02:47:33	malvarma	sanders*

2022-03-14 02:48:31	@natalia	ive been addicted to tomas fujiwara's band recently because the band has a really strong like Drive
2022-03-14 02:48:43	@natalia	reminds me of some of pharoah sanders stuff actually, but more weird and layered
2022-03-14 02:50:11	malvarma	you showed me some of that, yes that was very good

2022-03-14 02:52:40	malvarma	ah you know then. ok im going to have to find something else
2022-03-14 02:52:45	malvarma	oh nice
2022-03-14 02:52:48	@natalia	maybe i should listen to it all
2022-03-14 02:53:02	malvarma	was it on that free jazz radio show you found?
2022-03-14 02:53:32	malvarma	also, do you like sun ra
2022-03-14 02:55:06	extratone	Datafruits is hosting a pretty gnarly set by DJ Supermarket rn. https://datafruits.fm/chat
2022-03-14 02:55:34	@natalia	sun ra is cool

2022-03-14 02:56:38	malvarma	😎
2022-03-14 02:56:38	demoji	<malvarma> :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
2022-03-14 02:58:03	malvarma	if u haven't heard Atlantis by sun ra, that is my choice. it's peculiar clavinet music for most of the album, and then the last part is total free jazz freak out
2022-03-14 02:58:34	@natalia	hmmmm
2022-03-14 02:58:37	malvarma	its also lo fi sort of? i think he recorded it on wire
2022-03-14 02:58:46	@natalia	science fiction or atlantis...
2022-03-14 02:58:47	malvarma	nothing else sounds like it. i love that one
2022-03-14 02:58:49	malvarma	atlantis
2022-03-14 03:01:48	@natalia	aha
2022-03-14 03:03:57	malvarma	if you find incredible music through this show, please let me know about all of it
2022-03-14 03:04:19	@natalia	lemme see if i have good ones
2022-03-14 03:05:08	@natalia	Black Artists Group was reallt cool
2022-03-14 03:05:59	@natalia	"parker guy lytton trio" i barely remember but did remember being cool
2022-03-14 03:06:45	flowercorpse	sun ra <3
2022-03-14 03:07:41	flowercorpse	sun ra is so comforting to me
2022-03-14 03:07:47	malvarma	i just found the sun ra biography and plan to read it soon
2022-03-14 03:07:59	malvarma	im going to check out black artists group, never heard of that until now
2022-03-14 03:09:08	flowercorpse	I've been listening to Live in Rome lately, it's really good
2022-03-14 03:09:52	malvarma	i dont have that one! (but i suppose that's easy to say for sun ra, as there are like thousands of releases)
2022-03-14 03:11:49	flowercorpse	I recently saw Archie Shepp live
2022-03-14 03:12:18	malvarma	jealous
2022-03-14 03:13:23	malvarma	btw natalia i just picked the first black artists groups album that came up in my search, loving this. very spacious, good percussion. is there any particular release you're listening to?
2022-03-14 03:16:10	@natalia	maybe live in.. paris? idk it was on the radio and i didnt save it
2022-03-14 03:16:37	malvarma	yes this is what im listening to now. and i love every second of it
2022-03-14 03:19:48	@natalia	i love to torture Shazam with free jazz
2022-03-14 03:20:50	malvarma	i cant use shazam for this reason
2022-03-14 03:22:46	flowercorpse	please send me free jazz recommendations
2022-03-14 03:24:07	extratone	would that include solo improvised piano?
2022-03-14 03:24:35	extratone	because Keith Jarrett is the goto for that.
2022-03-14 03:24:41	malvarma	flowercorpse: i have mentioned this one here before, but not recently, so ill say it again: i love this dumb album https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvsctAZP_7g
2022-03-14 03:24:41	pinhook	["Huey "Sonny" Simmons - Burning Spirits 1970 Dsk 1 - YouTube"]
2022-03-14 03:25:32	flowercorpse	malvarma: Oh I like Staying on the Watch
2022-03-14 03:25:42	extratone	everyone will recommend Keith Jarrett's Koln Concert (the best selling solo piano record ever) but imo Vienna Concert is a lot more special. https://album.link/us/i/1444195265
2022-03-14 03:26:47	@natalia	i like how the town has slowly accumulated a sizable group of free jazz weirdos
2022-03-14 03:26:58	@natalia	i dont know how to play any instruments. we shoudl all meet up and play some day
2022-03-14 03:27:31	flowercorpse	extratone: Köln Concert is classic, I'll check Vienna out!
2022-03-14 03:27:34	@natalia	malvarma: listening to atlantis now
2022-03-14 03:28:04	flowercorpse	natalia: not knowing how to play is even better
2022-03-14 03:28:09	@natalia	exactly
2022-03-14 03:28:27	extratone	it's very serene, flowercorpse, but if you need more Jarrett recs, I'm sortof an obsessive. or, was, in a past life.
2022-03-14 03:28:37	katie	can i come? i know how to play instruments unfortunately..
2022-03-14 03:29:07	flowercorpse	I would gladly play in the town free jazz band
2022-03-14 03:29:26	extratone	one more: I think La Scala is my favorite but articulating why is beyond me lol https://album.link/us/i/1442229550
2022-03-14 03:29:51	malvarma	hmm, in my experience, it's possible to play good free jazz and know how to play, but you have to be good
2022-03-14 03:30:13	malvarma	it's a weird curve, that's high on the ends and lo in the middle
2022-03-14 03:32:27	@natalia	ive for a very long time wanted to come up with a way to organize like a Layered async group performance
2022-03-14 03:33:01	malvarma	i have always wondered about that. used to be in a few experimental music thingies online.
2022-03-14 03:33:42	malvarma	sucks that the lag makes real time improvisation impossible
2022-03-14 03:34:02	@natalia	yeah
2022-03-14 03:34:19	extratone	That was one of the things mentioned in the hype around 5G lol
2022-03-14 03:34:35	malvarma	the way i've done it before was, one person would put down a track then pass it around, composing via acretion
2022-03-14 03:34:53	malvarma	but isnt 5G not much faster than good fiber? or am i wrong
2022-03-14 03:35:20	@natalia	i wonder if you could set some weird rules in order to make it so that the first person didn't have any More control
2022-03-14 03:35:51	katie	there's a few plugins you can use to stream and receive in a DAW with a predefined delay. i used to do really shitty stuff with an internet friend that way. turns into a weird Tennis of iterating over a single measure
2022-03-14 03:35:56	extratone	malvarma: not where I live, certainly. https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1501949196957589506
2022-03-14 03:36:07	@natalia	what if people layered over themselves like 3 times and then deleted the old ones
2022-03-14 03:36:16	@natalia	so by the time the Thing is over theres not a clear starting point
2022-03-14 03:36:21	@natalia	its just like circular
2022-03-14 03:37:50	malvarma	natalia sometimes that happened
2022-03-14 03:40:23	malvarma	woah extratone never had experience with 5G (i dont know if my phone supports it) but that's awful
2022-03-14 03:41:26	@natalia	i had an idea i think a few years ago for an (irl) awful improv project someone's already done
2022-03-14 03:41:42	@natalia	where N people are recorded at once, but they only hear like one or two people to their right and nobody else
2022-03-14 03:41:45	@natalia	and it's like a circle
2022-03-14 03:41:57	flowercorpse	there is JackTrip from the CCRMA which tries to reduce the latency, but I don't have any experience in using it so I'm not sure if it would work
2022-03-14 03:42:04	malvarma	i think i had done stuff like that too!
2022-03-14 03:42:28	@natalia	but that one particularly would only work the way i envisioned actually like  Live
2022-03-14 03:42:49	extratone	it's just really overhyped and for a userbase that makes up like less than one percent of people with phones.
2022-03-14 03:43:11	extratone	people who want to play extremely low latency online games on their phones away from home lol.
2022-03-14 03:43:28	malvarma	oh i had not done that live, my bad.
2022-03-14 03:43:34	extratone	the usable range of 5g is something like a qurter of LTE.
2022-03-14 03:44:05	malvarma	extratone how dare you say that. 5G made little 3d things pop up during the thanksgiving parade. it's wonderworking!
2022-03-14 03:44:28	extratone	ah yes, you're right. 5g is absolutely what everyone was asking for.
2022-03-14 03:44:46	extratone	I love my country sm.
2022-03-14 03:44:51	malvarma	we're certainly "asking for it"
2022-03-14 03:45:08	malvarma	well not me
2022-03-14 03:46:22	flowercorpse	https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip/
2022-03-14 03:47:09	malvarma	i am intrigued by this
2022-03-14 03:47:29	malvarma	if it works, its a miracle
2022-03-14 03:47:39	extratone	guys I posted my TildeTown with Blink Shell guide in the Blink Discord and... lmao. https://ttm.sh/i9B.png
2022-03-14 03:47:42	<--	m455 (m455@localhost) has quit (Ping timeout: 2m30s)
2022-03-14 03:47:43	flowercorpse	although they claim a 500 mile radius so no jamming overseas :(
2022-03-14 03:50:16	malvarma	huh, i guess i understand someone not knowing what a pubnix is
2022-03-14 03:50:48	extratone	I told them "in short, Tildes are shared computers" and then sent the Paul Ford medium post. anything else I should say?
2022-03-14 03:50:53	malvarma	but shared machines...
2022-03-14 03:51:15	malvarma	like, if you use blink, then you by definition use unix, right?
2022-03-14 03:51:20	malvarma	or at least, are familiar with it
2022-03-14 03:51:29	katie	ask if they remember using the microsoft send-to-computer thing in their high school computer lab
2022-03-14 03:51:38	katie	the lil. chat that opened a dialog box everywhere
2022-03-14 03:52:06	extratone	tbhtbh, Blink is for rich devs who I guess use their iPad Pros full time to “develop” on remote Digital Ocean droplets from what I understand lol 
2022-03-14 03:52:22	extratone	too many tbh
2022-03-14 03:52:35	malvarma	hmm, "well see, timesharing... it's like the cloud"
2022-03-14 03:53:03	malvarma	all your computing is done "in the cloud" of the timeshared machine
2022-03-14 03:58:02	malvarma	extratone im curious why "develop" is in quotations. What do you think the stereotypical blink user is working on?
2022-03-14 03:59:00	extratone	I have no idea. that's why I used quotations. but I have zero silicon valley friends so I don't really know.
2022-03-14 04:00:05	extratone	and my only professional tech industry friends save one are all hardware people so.. lol
2022-03-14 04:00:05	malvarma	oh dear...i see what you mean
2022-03-14 04:01:30	malvarma	i dont any SV types in person, but i have come across people online very much going the unicorn startup route (some of them from new york, rather than SV), who seem to know a lot about one particular engine or framework
2022-03-14 04:01:58	malvarma	and tend to be focused less on programming as a whole, but more on programming the specific thing they are trying to build
2022-03-14 04:03:27	flowercorpse	it's getting late here, I'll go to sleep. I would really like to be involved with a town free jazz band, lets make it happen
2022-03-14 04:03:33	malvarma	perhaps that tunnel vision is necessary to make certain things.
2022-03-14 04:03:35	flowercorpse	also good night
2022-03-14 04:03:36	katie	i think this trait is one of the common things in startup culture that specifically causes most startups to fail
2022-03-14 04:03:39	malvarma	flowercorpse: im with you. and gn!
2022-03-14 04:03:45	<--	flowercorpse (flowercorpse@localhost) has quit (Quit: Goodnight)
2022-03-14 04:07:31	malvarma	katie: have you worked for one? i sort of did
2022-03-14 04:08:33	katie	i have previously; i also end up contracting either for startups or for clients of startups fairly frequently
2022-03-14 04:09:11	malvarma	ahh... i bet you have a lot of insight into that sort of thing then. what was it like?
2022-03-14 04:09:29	katie	i think the "able to get things done rapidly in X" trait is very common and extremely useful for the first few months of a startups life
2022-03-14 04:09:48	katie	but those types are rarely able to maintain anything that exists outside of their comfort zone
2022-03-14 04:10:35	malvarma	did you notice anyone make poor choices out of familiarity, rather than other considerations?
2022-03-14 04:11:39	malvarma	the one i worked for wasn't a start up in the sense that it was new. it had been around and "pivoted" a few times. it had investors, it was trying to grow. but i dont think the goal was to blow up big like some of the typical startups
2022-03-14 04:13:06	malvarma	they had the trappings of a startup company, like the lack of cubicles, the drinking on the job, and their competitor was a ycombinator company
2022-03-14 04:13:28	katie	constantly. at my current job i frequently pair program with someone who takes the path of highest familiarity at every opportunity, then watch him beat his head through a brick wall when this path ends up being a dead end. he's VERY good at beating his head through walls though, so it works out for him. he's very effective at meeting deliverables for clients incredibly quickly, but maintaining something that he's written is quite the challenge.
2022-03-14 04:14:14	malvarma	ooh, i think i know the type
2022-03-14 04:14:48	katie	he's so talented at it that i hold a lot of respect for it, but if he didn't have someone else to patch everything up behind him he'd collapse entirely. i think most startups consist almost entirely of this type of person
2022-03-14 04:15:28	malvarma	used to work with a guy in a web design place. every site he built, it would find a template on wordpress that was close to what the client wanted, and hack it up. he'd go through so many stupid plugins and little modifications (usually he paid someone on fiver to write them), instead of doing it the right way
2022-03-14 04:15:47	katie	thats the type!
2022-03-14 04:15:58	malvarma	but there was something to admire about that too, and i did learn from some of what he did
2022-03-14 04:16:35	katie	the frustrating part, for me anyway, is realizing that the traits that compose that guy are pretty necessary to posess to some degree in order to meet any level of Success in most tasks, yknow
2022-03-14 04:16:50	katie	i hate how Right that style of work is sometimes
2022-03-14 04:17:17	malvarma	one time a client had a crazy request, and most of us were ready to tell the client it couldn't be done for the budget they wanted. but this guy, he came up with a way to it that was awful, and had lots of problems
2022-03-14 04:17:37	malvarma	but it would technically do what the client asked, for the right price. and in the end, thats all the client cared about
2022-03-14 04:17:51	malvarma	so from him, i learned to never overestimate what the client is asking for
2022-03-14 04:17:55	katie	clients will always love the code you're the most ashamed of, i feel
2022-03-14 04:18:27	malvarma	well in this case, it wasnt code that was the problem. it was this convoluted way the feature would have to work
2022-03-14 04:19:07	malvarma	i dont remember all the details, but we had all assumed the client wouldn't ever go for something like that. too much work for them. but he correctly guessed that they would
2022-03-14 04:20:46	malvarma	hmm, thinking about it... it might have been the doll site (don't ask!). it was this weird client, who had all these very eccentric and picky demands
2022-03-14 04:22:06	katie	only incredibly tangentially related, but one of my favorite lessons to learn in product management is that clients *love* manual data entry and are almost always way more satisfied if you make them hire a guy to manually copy database entries into a new system than if you write a script to do it for them
2022-03-14 04:22:09	katie	eccentric how..
2022-03-14 04:22:31	malvarma	like they wanted to list products with a volume discount. but not anything consistent. each product had its own tiers, with their own discounts, and im talking there would be dozens of custom price tiers.
2022-03-14 04:22:43	dozens	dozens you say?
2022-03-14 04:22:53	malvarma	yes... that was very much what this was. it was something to prevent the client from doing tons of data entry
2022-03-14 04:23:47	malvarma	dozens if i say your name in a mirror three times, do you come out and kill me?
2022-03-14 04:23:47	extratone	lol dozens. I just listened to episode 1 of your podcast. wonderful! 
2022-03-14 04:24:03	malvarma	you have a podcast?!?!?!
2022-03-14 04:24:24	dozens	malvarma: if you say my name 3 times in a mirror i will show up and give you 4 cookies
2022-03-14 04:24:51	dozens	malvarma: http://tilde.town/~dozens/podcast/
2022-03-14 04:25:14	malvarma	katie: but yeah, the client had all these other stipulations. they didn't want to calculate shipping because they could rearrange things in the box themselves to shave off a few pennies
2022-03-14 04:25:20	dozens	extratone: thanks!! podcasting is still funny to me because i have no idea what i'm doing lol. besides having a good time :)
2022-03-14 04:26:29	malvarma	well im gonna listen to the podcast tomorrow, looking forward to this
2022-03-14 04:26:32	extratone	you have no idea how much I hope you stay that way. I've been listening to podcasts for almost 15 years and the medium has become... far less enjoyable with its popularity, recently.
2022-03-14 04:26:45	extratone	screwing around is what I want.
2022-03-14 04:27:04	extratone	can't resist sharing this. https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/everyone-has-a-podcast-none-but-god-are-listening
2022-03-14 04:27:40	extratone	if you'd like, dozens, I'd love to be a guest sometime. my special area of expertise being using the Tildeverse on iPhone, I guess.
2022-03-14 04:28:00	malvarma	catchy tune
2022-03-14 04:28:50	extratone	the funniest thing about that is I sent it to the woman I sampled (Ashley Carman, The Verge,) and she was actually amused.
2022-03-14 04:29:07	malvarma	i, no joke, was in a band with a guy who started listening to joe rogan, and then one day said to us "hey we're all funny, we should just do a podcast".... he moved to colorado to work on a weed farm and i dont speak to him anymore
2022-03-14 04:29:28	malvarma	if he waited a year or two, he could have worked on a weed farm here
2022-03-14 04:29:28	extratone	:(
2022-03-14 04:29:52	dozens	extratone: hell yes. i will shoot you a dm about scheduling a time, and then we shall podcast together
2022-03-14 04:29:52	malvarma	oh extratone what does this sample
2022-03-14 04:29:55	malvarma	this guitar part!!!!!
2022-03-14 04:30:07	extratone	an episode of her podcast lol
2022-03-14 04:30:16	extratone	I think... or it might have been a Verge Video.
2022-03-14 04:30:23	dozens	malvarma: lololol that is a ridiculous story
2022-03-14 04:30:38	malvarma	oh wow well its a nice little riff
2022-03-14 04:31:44	malvarma	dozens i know, so ridiculous. almost nobody says that sort of thing. "lets start a podcast"
2022-03-14 04:31:47	extratone	also, that track was made entirely in Garageband on my iPhone lol. I just wanted to see what i could do at first and then ended up spending far too much time on that.
2022-03-14 04:32:59	malvarma	"what are we gonna talk about?" "well just whatever we talk about here" "oh like how we dont like the setlist you came up with, and how we dont practice enough?"
2022-03-14 04:33:26	extratone	that sounds better than 90% of what's in my feed these days.
2022-03-14 04:33:43	malvarma	oh dear, well what sort of thing pops up now?
2022-03-14 04:34:12	malvarma	i do listen to podcasts (i think everyone does?) but im not really aware of whats popular
2022-03-14 04:34:17	extratone	overproduced radio-ready programs.
2022-03-14 04:34:41	malvarma	oh you mean how everything sounds like radiolab?
2022-03-14 04:34:47	extratone	I have complained about it too much, though. enough that I almost wrote an entire Post on it before I realized what I was doing.
2022-03-14 04:34:48	extratone	YES
2022-03-14 04:35:28	extratone	I just think we need more terms. "Podcast" now refers to far too wide a variety of things, dare I say.
2022-03-14 04:36:48	malvarma	i see the appeal, i never liked radio lab, but there is stuff that has that sound, like 99% invisible, and some of the NPR shows. those shows feel like the audio version of reading a magazine article
2022-03-14 04:37:03	@natalia	hey listen to my free improv audio zine
2022-03-14 04:37:18	@natalia	s/v/v lo-fi/
2022-03-14 04:37:19	sedbot	<natalia> hey listen to my free improv lo-fi audio zine
2022-03-14 04:37:21	malvarma	like, it gives you an overview into something you've never heard of before, doesnt go into depth, doesnt discuss anything. but that can be fun
2022-03-14 04:37:33	malvarma	i suppose the sound gets very samey though
2022-03-14 04:38:05	extratone	yes. screwing around is precious.
2022-03-14 04:38:07	malvarma	natalia: you have a zine?
2022-03-14 04:38:48	dozens	radio zine = podcast
2022-03-14 04:39:08	@natalia	hypothetical although it would be funny
2022-03-14 04:39:23	@natalia	just record whatever into a cassette, mixed conversation and music
2022-03-14 04:39:33	@natalia	light normalization
2022-03-14 04:39:41	malvarma	i have heard stuff like that. that sounds like some shows on the weird station by me
2022-03-14 04:39:58	dozens	natalia: have you /listened/ to tilde whirl? you are describing my aesthetic
2022-03-14 04:39:58	extratone	dozens: I love that you've published to the web archive first but if you're ever looking for an easy way to post to the rest of the services, anchor.fm is still free.
2022-03-14 04:40:05	@natalia	dozens: i haven't yett
2022-03-14 04:40:13	malvarma	there used to be one where it was this collage a guy made, out of music, field recordings, inverviews, little monologues
2022-03-14 04:40:38	@natalia	we should do an episode whree you interview me and i answer with indescipherable effect pedal screeching
2022-03-14 04:40:45	extratone	I still publish to anchor even though its owned by spotify and get satisfaction that I"m taking up spotify resources with my bs.
2022-03-14 04:40:47	dozens	extratone: okay so my partner and i just started podcasting at the same time and they went the anchor.fm route and it sounds 10000% better than what i'm doing in every way
2022-03-14 04:40:58	dozens	but i'm a masochist, and so i continue to do it the hard way
2022-03-14 04:41:11	katie	"interviewing my synth"
2022-03-14 04:41:24	dozens	but i would recomend anchor.fm to anybody and everybody starting from scratch. it is the tits
2022-03-14 04:41:31	extratone	I would say if anything, keep posting to the web archive first.
2022-03-14 04:41:45	dozens	oh no yeah, imma keep doing it the hard way
2022-03-14 04:41:46	extratone	don't actually try to record with the anchor app though lol.
2022-03-14 04:42:33	extratone	anchor used to be a very cute service. they were the only people to ever cold contact me about my online magazine asking for it to be the first featured channel in the music category.
2022-03-14 04:42:44	dozens	my dream for tilde whirl is actually some kind of audio zine kind of thing. i'd love it people would submit audio segments of recipes, poems, field recordings, etc.

2022-03-14 04:42:52	extratone	and then spotify bought them and they stopped responding to my emails.
2022-03-14 04:42:58	dozens	yike
2022-03-14 04:43:05	malvarma	i have so many field recordings and strange clips
2022-03-14 04:43:10	dozens	malvarma: pls
2022-03-14 04:43:23	malvarma	ill have to get some to you
2022-03-14 04:43:31	extratone	I'm just going to send you my "Voice Notes" where I monologue about how much I hate widgets.
2022-03-14 04:43:42	dozens	malvarma: when you're on the podcast, can it be half weird field recordings, half weird roleplaying games
2022-03-14 04:43:49	extratone	if you're looking to publish short segments, whyp.it is underappreciated.
2022-03-14 04:43:51	dozens	extratone: yes pls
2022-03-14 04:44:37	malvarma	well, i dont know that much about games. there aren't that many things i can speak authoritatively on
2022-03-14 04:44:52	dozens	fuck authority
2022-03-14 04:44:57	malvarma	so it will have to be 100% field recordings
2022-03-14 04:45:06	malvarma	of role playing games
2022-03-14 04:45:07	dozens	natalia: i look forward to interviewing your screetches
2022-03-14 04:45:10	extratone	I could actually come on and talk about something I know *the least* about. like food.
2022-03-14 04:45:31	dozens	extratone: "This segment is called: NOT MY JOB"
2022-03-14 04:45:31	malvarma	how does food work
2022-03-14 04:45:43	extratone	lmao.
2022-03-14 04:46:09	dozens	malvarma: wait i'm sorry. didn't we play together one time? Wizards grimorie? am i inventing this memory?
2022-03-14 04:46:25	extratone	I think going over my iPhone Tilde guide would probably put listeners to sleep, so I encourage you to book me sooner rather than later so its early on and excusable.
2022-03-14 04:46:46	dozens	yes i am, i think. it think it was apreche and cymen actually.
2022-03-14 04:47:01	dozens	extratone: no i am one million percent interested in this setup
2022-03-14 04:47:31	malvarma	dozens: we did play your giraffe game. and i think we spoke a little about paranoia, gamma world, and tekumel
2022-03-14 04:47:46	dozens	oh shit yes
2022-03-14 04:47:51	extratone	I learned a lot! https://bilge.world/tildetown-iphone-blink-shell

2022-03-14 04:48:03	dozens	that's right. that giraffe game lead to some good stuf
2022-03-14 04:48:11	malvarma	i still think about it to this day
2022-03-14 04:48:23	dozens	http://tilde.town/~dozens/giraffe/
2022-03-14 04:48:42	malvarma	dozens: have we ever talked about fatal? That's another game ive never played, but have read about none the less
2022-03-14 04:49:10	dozens	malvarma: no i don't think i know that one
2022-03-14 04:49:41	dozens	tekumel is one i've never played, and i'm mostly interested in the setting
2022-03-14 04:49:45	malvarma	ooh boy... well its a terrible game. the worst RPG ever made perhaps. there are so many unnecessary rules, and they really show the author's um.... obsessions
2022-03-14 04:50:43	malvarma	dozens: if you wanna do a podcast about that awful box and slime comic, that would be my real expertise
2022-03-14 04:51:49	dozens	malvarma: SHIT YES, that will be the very first thing we talk about on the podcast lol
2022-03-14 04:52:23	dozens	malvarma: hoooo kay, yeah i looked it up. yeah i know what fatal is: a total meme of sex and violence
2022-03-14 04:52:55	malvarma	yeah i have a note hear to find a copy of that

2022-03-14 05:16:38	malvarma	i have not played, but i have heard good things
2022-03-14 05:17:01	petra	such a nice game
2022-03-14 05:17:47	malvarma	it can be so relaxing to dictate the design of a city, like you are some kind of urban planning tyrant. and in a game like skylines, you are not limited to such a rudimentary model, like in the older sim city games
2022-03-14 05:20:23	malvarma	the temptation for me is too strong though. id probably get frustrated that i couldn't do things so easily in real life
2022-03-14 05:20:57	malvarma	but oh how i fantasize about being ruler for a day, and bulldozing places i don't like
2022-03-14 05:21:19	petra	another game I've been playing is NIMBY Rails, which is very complicated and dry but does have that fantasy element
2022-03-14 05:21:59	malvarma	oh nooooo!!!!! ahahaha
2022-03-14 05:22:14	malvarma	the listing on steam says "express your strong opinion on rail networks"

2022-03-14 05:22:22	petra	yep!
2022-03-14 05:22:55	malvarma	i hope this game grows in popularity, and educates people about the issues
2022-03-14 05:23:17	malvarma	or maybe that wont matter, and the problem is that people are just selfish

2022-03-14 09:18:43	cymen	I don't know if there is a large overlap in people.
2022-03-14 09:19:02	cymen	But definitely finding weird online spaces, retro tech, small web,...lot's of cultural overlap
2022-03-14 09:19:30	extratone	I really love NeoCities but have 0 folks to talk about it with basically.
2022-03-14 09:19:42	extratone	NeoCities does not have an equivalent of this chat.
2022-03-14 09:20:13	juspib	yea that's the primary thing about it
2022-03-14 09:21:01	juspib	neocities embraces 90's and 00's tech, emails and stuff
2022-03-14 09:21:53	juspib	tilde.town is modern tech and modern communication
2022-03-14 09:22:02	extratone	I've seen the most delightful/impressive web pages there.
2022-03-14 09:22:34	extratone	I'm assuming that was sarcasm, juspib, given that we are currently chatting on IRC lol
2022-03-14 09:23:09	juspib	is IRC not modern?
2022-03-14 09:23:34	juspib	it's instant, you can access it through whatever gui you write or find
2022-03-14 09:24:16	extratone	I'm not sure if I have an answer to that, but I think the vast majority of folks seem to think IRC is a past thing.
2022-03-14 09:24:52	extratone	this chat was my first time using IRC in almost 15 years lol
2022-03-14 09:25:52	extratone	(which doesn't necessarily mean anything.)
2022-03-14 09:25:53	juspib	i've never used IRC before signing up on tilde.town so it's modern in my eyes
2022-03-14 09:26:38	extratone	well that's cool! 
2022-03-14 09:27:27	extratone	but I think you're right about TildeTown in the sense that... there's nothing particularly nostalgic about it. or inherently nostalgic.

2022-03-14 09:35:23	cymen	juspib: actually I think IRC is not very modern
2022-03-14 09:35:30	cymen	it doesn't sync well between devices
2022-03-14 09:35:33	cymen	has no proper encryption
2022-03-14 09:35:42	cymen	does not allow files and such in a sensible manner :)
2022-03-14 09:38:36	juspib	it's possible to encrypt irc
2022-03-14 09:39:30	juspib	and not putting files on the server is a plus for me
2022-03-14 09:39:37	cymen	not as part of the standard
2022-03-14 09:39:58	cymen	and not being able to share files is definitely not a plus
2022-03-14 09:40:03	cymen	although, I get your point :)
2022-03-14 09:40:45	juspib	i don't have experience with how it syncs
2022-03-14 09:43:41	cymen	It doesn't you only get the messages that come in when you're online.
2022-03-14 09:43:57	cymen	Except for some playback things that people have built.
2022-03-14 09:44:52	cymen	I mean, IRC is from the 80ies so I cannot blame it.
2022-03-14 09:45:28	juspib	a yea that's bad
2022-03-14 09:48:17	extratone	I was not aware of sadgrl.online but oh my.
2022-03-14 09:48:46	extratone	as I've said here before, I don't think IRC makes sense for most use cases anymore, but it absolutely makes sense for this chat.
2022-03-14 09:57:08	nihilazo	IRC doesn't make sense for most use cases
2022-03-14 09:58:03	nihilazo	but idk anything better for a chat like this
2022-03-14 09:58:11	nihilazo	like, every chat program and/or protocol sucks, IRC included

2022-03-14 11:40:53	juspib	well that's just specialist language
2022-03-14 11:41:25	juspib	like here we have tons of words to describe a pigeon's appearance but few people know them

2022-03-14 14:18:26	elly	oh
2022-03-14 14:18:31	elly	well, what do you want them to do?
2022-03-14 14:19:00	@natalia	https://www.vanormondt.net/~peter/blog/2021-03-16-mutt-office365-mfa.html
2022-03-14 14:19:03	@natalia	A Link
2022-03-14 14:19:33	asm	not force nonfree software
2022-03-14 14:19:58	asm	natalia: I tried that
2022-03-14 14:20:00	asm	didn't work
2022-03-14 14:20:11	elly	so more specifically, you want them to help you figure out how to use Thunderbird, or?
2022-03-14 14:20:21	asm	no
2022-03-14 14:20:35	@natalia	how didn't it work
2022-03-14 14:20:37	asm	I know how to use clients like mutt and thunderbird
2022-03-14 14:20:43	elly	with their service I mean
2022-03-14 14:21:24	asm	natalia: it brought up a screen saying I needed approval from ITS to use it, and they just ignore those emails (or maybe even just auto-delete them, idk)
2022-03-14 14:22:11	@natalia	with oauth?
2022-03-14 14:22:16	asm	yes
2022-03-14 14:23:10	elly	if you need their approval and they're ignoring you I think the next step is to talk to your dean or similar
2022-03-14 14:24:28	dzwdz	wait, so every time you log in via an unofficial client the admins get an email that they have to approve?
2022-03-14 14:25:22	asm	I don't think it'll be every time
2022-03-14 14:25:29	asm	but they just never approve anything
2022-03-14 14:25:39	dzwdz	ah, a single time thing is reasonable
2022-03-14 14:26:14	elly	if they mailed you back, replying with something like "When I try to log in I get a thing telling me that ITS needs to approve this client - is there somewhere I need to file a request for that?" or whatever
2022-03-14 14:26:19	elly	is probably not a bad bet
2022-03-14 14:32:24	juspib	not really
2022-03-14 14:33:05	@natalia	why not
2022-03-14 14:33:13	juspib	what's their issue with mail clients that they have to aprove them?
2022-03-14 14:33:50	elly	I do not think that emailing them asking about it will get asm what they want
2022-03-14 14:34:21	@natalia	the average client is not a Computer User and they probably had an unreasonable amount of phishing
2022-03-14 14:36:04	elly	but also, if you want to get your way in a bureaucracy, it is usually more productive to ask how to navigate the policy than to argue directly with the policy

2022-03-14 16:06:52	bx	is funemployment a real term?
2022-03-14 16:06:56	tomasino	and i totally understand where the nerves might be coming from
2022-03-14 16:07:10	@vilmibm	bx: it is commonly used, yes, to imply unemployment by choice
2022-03-14 16:07:18	bx	Huh, til
2022-03-14 16:07:46	tomasino	what's the first fun thing you're looking forward to doing with your funemployment
2022-03-14 16:08:02	@vilmibm	i'm less scared about being in that state (it sounds great and i have ample savings), more just full of "oh god what if i regret not having commit on the gh cli" anxiety. because i am proud of that project
2022-03-14 16:08:19	tomasino	it's a very cool project
2022-03-14 16:08:39	@vilmibm	tomasino: reading several books. then going hard on tildemush / town stuff.
2022-03-14 16:08:45	tomasino	time to start working on the town-cli project! ;)
2022-03-14 16:08:46	bx	having comit = adding in gur feature to commit with it ?
2022-03-14 16:08:50	extratone	oooo
2022-03-14 16:09:11	bx	vilmibm: niiiice
2022-03-14 16:09:19	@vilmibm	bx: no like, i am a maintainer of it and have commit rights. i can push to trunk whenever i want! it's a heady amount of power
2022-03-14 16:09:29	bx	Oo
2022-03-14 16:09:43	tomasino	last-week easter egg time?
2022-03-14 16:09:55	@vilmibm	having a tool i've had a huge part in designing and implementing that has 100,000 active monthly users is intense
2022-03-14 16:10:11	tomasino	i use it! ;)
2022-03-14 16:10:13	@vilmibm	tomasino: hehe since extensions support shipped my team pushes me towards putting my weird shit into extensions
2022-03-14 16:10:20	bx	yea that sounds intense for something like gh cli
2022-03-14 16:10:25	@vilmibm	but `gh repo garden` lives on
2022-03-14 16:10:27	dozens	what's the difference between funemployment and retirement?
2022-03-14 16:10:43	@vilmibm	dozens: i think retirement has a legal connotation
2022-03-14 16:10:47	bx	Huh
2022-03-14 16:10:49	dozens	ah
2022-03-14 16:10:51	bx	didn't know that
2022-03-14 16:10:59	@vilmibm	but i could be wrong
2022-03-14 16:11:08	bx	i just think of retirement as "too old or injured to work anymroe"
2022-03-14 16:11:09	@vilmibm	i think funemployment also suggests "i might go back to work at some point"
2022-03-14 16:11:22	bx	it does give that vibe
2022-03-14 16:11:23	elly	funemployment definitely suggests temporary and retirement suggests permanent
2022-03-14 16:11:27	dozens	"I am illegally retired!"
2022-03-14 16:11:28	@vilmibm	which i might if i get tired of living on a budget
2022-03-14 16:11:32	@vilmibm	hehe
2022-03-14 16:11:59	elly	also, there are legal meanings for retirement only if you are above a certain age and (afaik) only for some kind of investment account and such
2022-03-14 16:12:08	dozens	i haven't actually ever done this, but i love the idea of frequent mini-retirements. which i guess is funemployments.
2022-03-14 16:12:20	@vilmibm	i keep thinking "oh god i get paid to work on an open source CLI tool how can i do better than that" then look at my savings and realize "oh i could be working on open source CLI tools full time and not for a corporation"
2022-03-14 16:12:35	elly	dozens: yeah that's funemployment :)
2022-03-14 16:12:55	dozens	vilmibm: full time Mayor of Tilde Town?
2022-03-14 16:13:03	dozens	elly: yeah i guess it is haha
2022-03-14 16:13:08	@vilmibm	dozens: pretty much
2022-03-14 16:13:17	bx	funemployment does sound good
2022-03-14 16:13:32	bx	gur idea of working more than 2 years in one place really creeps me out
2022-03-14 16:13:42	dozens	well i for one am looking forward to seeing a lot more vilmibm.
2022-03-14 16:13:52	elly	meanwhile I am closing in on the 12 year mark :P
2022-03-14 16:13:52	@vilmibm	<3
2022-03-14 16:13:52	dozens	maybe that means moar tildemush updates lol
2022-03-14 16:14:01	@vilmibm	it does! i'm so excited to work on it
2022-03-14 16:14:12	bx	elly: just to be clear i mean physical location
2022-03-14 16:14:36	@vilmibm	i have put over 4 years into GH which is my longest employment term ever, but i've done it all remotely while moving around
2022-03-14 16:14:46	elly	ahh
2022-03-14 16:14:49	bx	See that seems more chill
2022-03-14 16:15:04	@vilmibm	it's fine and if i didn't have these savings i would be fine with my job
2022-03-14 16:15:21	@vilmibm	but i can feel the best parts of my brain energy all going into work and that makes me sad when i have this alternative
2022-03-14 16:15:53	dozens	did i tell you i applied at github during pandemic? they send me a unix-ish code challenge and then they were like, sorry dozens you don't know enuf bash or whatever
2022-03-14 16:16:10	@vilmibm	wow i'm sorry
2022-03-14 16:16:17	dozens	i was never really sure what i was applying for lol
2022-03-14 16:16:23	@vilmibm	getting a job at GH is very difficult unless you know someone
2022-03-14 16:16:26	bx	that seems rude, people can learn bash
2022-03-14 16:16:28	@vilmibm	and like, Someone
2022-03-14 16:16:45	@vilmibm	like not a normal person like me but a director or up
2022-03-14 16:16:56	@vilmibm	also GH sources from Microsoft first and a loooot of msft people want to move to GH
2022-03-14 16:16:57	bx	Ah yes Someone Jones, head of github recruitment
2022-03-14 16:17:00	@vilmibm	hehe
2022-03-14 16:17:11	dozens	Someone Hub
2022-03-14 16:18:04	bx	has someone already made a shithub parody site
2022-03-14 16:20:32	bx	where people upload code exclusively related to poop
2022-03-14 16:20:49	dozens	wow the front page of github looks like crap now. super generic corporate, scroll jack, etc
2022-03-14 16:21:09	@vilmibm	GH is very corporate
2022-03-14 16:21:33	bx	oh god
2022-03-14 16:21:34	bx	EW
2022-03-14 16:21:36	bx	EW
2022-03-14 16:21:41	@vilmibm	OKRs and numbers go up and shareholder values etc
2022-03-14 16:21:43	bx	this used to be nice
2022-03-14 16:22:14	dozens	ew, Oklahoma Requirements?
2022-03-14 16:22:18	@vilmibm	if only
2022-03-14 16:22:25	bx	thought "gur people who get pleasure from seeing numbers go up are gur worst people to be running anything"
2022-03-14 16:22:27	elly	objectives & key results
2022-03-14 16:22:36	@vilmibm	i would rather be forced to sing along to songs from the musical Oklahoma! than have to draft / adhere to Objective Key Results
2022-03-14 16:23:06	elly	a management thing Intel made up that then infected most of the rest of the tech industry in one form or another
2022-03-14 16:23:11	@archangelic	Symantec wasn’t as hung up about OKRs as most of these newer companies are.
2022-03-14 16:23:29	dozens	as a completionist, okrs depress me with their 'you should only be able to achieve 70% of this goal'
2022-03-14 16:23:34	@archangelic	Maybe my manager shielded us from it, but I doubt that.
2022-03-14 16:23:49	@natalia	i love looking up new management terms because it's nearly the only place nowadays where i see modern websites use "gender neutral" he/him pronouns lol
2022-03-14 16:24:20	elly	dozens: aw, I like the 70% thing
2022-03-14 16:24:39	dozens	depends on the day, i guess.
2022-03-14 16:24:47	elly	for me it helps not worry about not getting OKRs done :P
2022-03-14 16:25:11	dozens	haha, legit
2022-03-14 16:26:25	@archangelic	OKRs seem like KPI’s nicer cousin.
2022-03-14 16:26:33	@vilmibm	AAAHHH i forgot about KPIs
2022-03-14 16:26:37	@vilmibm	saidjaisjdfioasjd
2022-03-14 16:26:38	elly	the KR part is basically KPIs
2022-03-14 16:26:48	elly	and the O part is like "why should anyone care about these"
2022-03-14 16:26:56	@archangelic	KPIs give me ptsd flashbacks (not joking)
2022-03-14 16:26:59	@vilmibm	i am buying my freedom from this world of madness and power language
2022-03-14 16:27:07	elly	man y'all have had some bad managers
2022-03-14 16:27:15	@archangelic	I worked in call centere
2022-03-14 16:27:19	@vilmibm	s/managers/companies
2022-03-14 16:27:33	@archangelic	My pay was set by KPIs in some cases.
2022-03-14 16:27:40	elly	commission vibes
2022-03-14 16:27:48	@natalia	what if tilde.town had a public cgit. would that be overkill because we have the other gitea man
2022-03-14 16:27:51	@archangelic	I got fired because of KPIs once
2022-03-14 16:27:56	@natalia	ooogh
2022-03-14 16:27:58	elly	:(
2022-03-14 16:28:11	@vilmibm	archangelic: <3 ;_;
2022-03-14 16:28:41	@vilmibm	natalia: public as in anyone can interact with it?
2022-03-14 16:28:45	@archangelic	Yeah, was taking too long on calls because my team was having me do tier 2 troubleshooting with no promotion to tier 2. Never again.
2022-03-14 16:29:10	@archangelic	Young and eager to please, and got taken advantage of.
2022-03-14 16:29:53	@archangelic	But honestly I think they didn’t like me that much regardless.
2022-03-14 16:30:25	@natalia	vilmibm: cgit is read only so yeah, instead of needing an account you'd just put dirs in public_cgit or something. might not be that useful actually, having two would be confusing
2022-03-14 16:31:16	@natalia	archangelic: awful metrics hurt so bad
2022-03-14 16:31:18	@vilmibm	could be confusing, but i'm open to talking about if it's a better solution for the town than gitea. but last time it came up a number of people said they really appreciated the gitea so i donno
2022-03-14 16:32:04	twee	last time i hosted my own git i prefered cgit to gitea
2022-03-14 16:32:21	 *	bx likes gur gitea but is open to change
2022-03-14 16:32:32	twee	i cant remember my logic and it might have been to do with setup, which i wouldnt have to worry about, but i know that was what i used for a couple years after testing a few things
2022-03-14 16:32:43	@natalia	my current workplace all around the board has a nice variety of really bad metrics that do nothing but harm mostly
2022-03-14 16:32:47	twee	imo cgit looks better
2022-03-14 16:32:58	elly	natalia: oh no
2022-03-14 16:33:13	elly	one of the arguments I find myself in a LOT at work is "we should not measure that"
2022-03-14 16:33:16	@natalia	i prefer cgit for self-hosting but i wouldn't want to change gitea so i don't really think it's necessary
2022-03-14 16:33:21	elly	people are always so tempted to be like "it will be more data points!"
2022-03-14 16:33:44	@vilmibm	i like the idea of public_git directory mirroring public_html and public_gopher
2022-03-14 16:34:05	@vilmibm	i do not hate gitea by any means (i think it's really cool software) but it feels incongruous with other town stuff
2022-03-14 16:34:13	bx	more data points != better data
2022-03-14 16:34:18	@natalia	here are is a (very biased and poorly thought up!) number you will be expected to compete for but not be reasonably compensated for (lol lmao) also can you do these things that will hurt your performance
2022-03-14 16:34:27	twee	vilmibm: that's a good point actually
2022-03-14 16:34:32	twee	and public_git sounds kind of cool
2022-03-14 16:34:48	@vilmibm	in the name of Eris and general chaos i'm fine with having competing git hosting
2022-03-14 16:34:53	elly	bx: and indeed, more data points sometimes means *worse* decisions, because the presence of data plays directly into the availability bias in human psychology
2022-03-14 16:35:02	elly	so having data that does not mean much is very dangerous
2022-03-14 16:35:14	bx	Yea
2022-03-14 16:35:47	bx	gur idea of work places encouraging you to compete with coworkers sound horrifying
2022-03-14 16:36:01	 *	bx is grateful to not have to do that
2022-03-14 16:37:10	elly	I haven't encountered that in my career yet thankfully
2022-03-14 16:40:04	bx	I mostly havent
2022-03-14 16:40:17	twee	i ahven't had a career yet
2022-03-14 16:40:49	bx	though i only had a job for 2 months :p
2022-03-14 16:41:40	bx	gur idea of gur competition for who would eventually get promoted when a slot was open was def something that i stressed about though
2022-03-14 16:42:02	juspib	i just noticed it's π day
2022-03-14 16:42:31	twee	just got so pissed off that a class wasn't defined in this project, or documented in the library reference, when i remembered i'd narrowed the buffer

2022-03-14 16:49:14	dozens	like, you eat it, and then enjoy eternal damnation, but it is worth it

2022-03-14 16:49:46	bx	cocoa im ok with
2022-03-14 16:50:07	twee	i think the eternal damnation is a play on the sinful, which is just what you say when something is very rich
2022-03-14 16:50:16	twee	have you had 100% cocoa dark chocolate?
2022-03-14 16:50:20	bx	Yesssssss

2022-03-14 17:04:45	@vilmibm	omg "Whether Guillaume succeeded in removing the "seductive" elements may be a matter of individual perception." is a powerful phrase
2022-03-14 17:05:04	bx	"distracting allure and "unhealthy beauty".["
2022-03-14 17:05:11	bx	that's one way to put it

2022-03-14 17:07:27	bx	it's a pretty impressive skulpture
2022-03-14 17:09:35	bx	i feel like older paintings / sculpture are things i like in gur same way as new games with facny rendering tech
2022-03-14 17:10:14	bx	like most of these are just naked people / mythological figures, in some settings that dont really appeal to me
2022-03-14 17:10:31	bx	but it's super imressive and intresting to try and break down on a technical levle

2022-03-14 17:17:12	twee	because it's so slow
2022-03-14 17:17:23	twee	and all it should be doing is drawing a few images
2022-03-14 17:21:43	bx	Hm
2022-03-14 17:21:59	bx	lemme know if you find gur culprit, it sounds intresting
2022-03-14 17:28:41	twee	will do
2022-03-14 17:28:54	twee	also it fails randomly (or presumably not randomly) on a single album

2022-03-14 18:21:43	nihilazo	in philosophy class today we talked about ontological queerness
2022-03-14 18:21:55	nihilazo	and I was excited that it was about the fact that fundemental existance is HELLA GAY
2022-03-14 18:22:06	juspib	we talked about running doom yesterday so i'll link a new vid from raspberry pi https://youtu.be/vXr7tOR3dis

2022-03-14 18:22:35	juspib	what does ontological queerness mean
2022-03-14 18:23:42	nihilazo	something's state of existence being unusual, I guess
2022-03-14 18:23:50	nihilazo	idk we just talked about the term, not actually the theory

2022-03-14 19:23:30	m455	but yeah what cymen says lol
2022-03-14 19:23:35	m455	it's probably legit to plan shit out
2022-03-14 19:23:39	@vilmibm	and as i walked to my desk to do the zoom i said to my wife "best news i could get is that he is quitting bc if he goes i am way less anxious about leaving"
2022-03-14 19:23:43	cymen	some people just write these and don't think too much about what you might read into it :)

2022-03-14 19:24:27	dzwdz	i'd say nice but it's weird to cheer on for a random guy leaving his workplace
2022-03-14 19:24:30	cymen	why does it make you less anxious about leaving that he is leaiving?
2022-03-14 19:24:30	@vilmibm	i wasn't too worried -- he and i are proper friends
2022-03-14 19:24:35	dzwdz	but like, nice?

2022-03-14 19:25:49	@vilmibm	and as he got promoted up to my grandboss he helped continue to make my team a very chill thing

2022-03-14 20:16:25	extratone	for whatever reason, Blink allows you to tie any text command to a keyboard shortcut... as long as it's hex encoded first.

2022-03-14 20:17:50	bx	*nice
2022-03-14 20:18:12	bx	powershell accepts a script to run from gur command line, if you encode it as base64
2022-03-14 20:18:17	extratone	it's a shame because I have literally a dozen methods of converting text to base64 or URL encoding it... or ROT... but not hex lol

2022-03-14 20:30:06	palmdrop	@natalia: so shitty, fuck
2022-03-14 20:30:12	@vilmibm	"boss yelling at employee" is unwarranted and toxic 99.9% of the time
2022-03-14 20:30:27	palmdrop	bx: sound really pleasant, will do in the summer
2022-03-14 20:30:52	m455	natalia: fuck i'm so sorry you had to experience that :(. what a horrible person
2022-03-14 20:30:58	palmdrop	@natalia: unionize if possible. Not always possible of course, but generally a good idea

2022-03-14 21:11:16	dzwdz	vilmibm: that's a dope idea!
2022-03-14 21:11:50	dzwdz	i assume it'd be something like a bulletin board with location markings?
2022-03-14 21:12:48	@vilmibm	pretty much -- a listing is a description/title/image, regions available to ship to, and then giveaway or barter
2022-03-14 21:12:51	nihilazo	yeah I think that would be cool
2022-03-14 21:13:13	elly	sounds like a mailing list or forum thread basically
2022-03-14 21:13:21	nihilazo	I mean yeah, could just be that
2022-03-14 21:13:31	nihilazo	I think that it'd be cool if town had a revamped forum
2022-03-14 21:13:39	nihilazo	I don't think bbj still has a maintainer
2022-03-14 21:13:43	dzwdz	a mailing list doesn't seem like that good of an idea for this
2022-03-14 21:14:01	dzwdz	townies generally live pretty far from one another, so most of the emails you'd get would be noise

2022-03-14 21:15:00	@vilmibm	yeah i like it being a little more filterable than a flat list
2022-03-14 21:15:08	@vilmibm	it's not like that wouldn't work
2022-03-14 21:15:12	@vilmibm	i'm just thinking cutely
2022-03-14 21:15:21	dzwdz	i think i'll write a timetracking thingy for terminal utilities
2022-03-14 21:15:32	owl	\o bx
2022-03-14 21:15:52	nihilazo	I want to work on some cool things for town
2022-03-14 21:15:54	dzwdz	so you could do `track irssi`, and you'd have a timer on screen of how long you've spent in irssi today
2022-03-14 21:16:08	bx	dzwdz: thats an intresting idea
2022-03-14 21:16:09	nihilazo	but right now I have forbidden myself from writing programs, while I learn to program
2022-03-14 21:16:15	dzwdz	that's
2022-03-14 21:16:23	bx	see that'd be something worth shoving into tmux if it was more hackable
2022-03-14 21:16:26	dzwdz	like forbidding yourself from cooking while learning how to cook
2022-03-14 21:16:29	nihilazo	or at least whole I do as much htdp as I care to do and actually want to learn to do something properly
2022-03-14 21:16:51	@vilmibm	my advice is to give yourself permission to write "bad" programs while learning
2022-03-14 21:16:55	dzwdz	^
2022-03-14 21:17:01	nihilazo	I mean, I've had a decade of writing shit programs
2022-03-14 21:17:08	nihilazo	I've decided to try and learn how to write good programs
2022-03-14 21:17:17	dzwdz	you've said that after a program works you're done with it?
2022-03-14 21:17:24	dzwdz	you don't do the entire organising/maintaining/etc part
2022-03-14 21:17:27	@vilmibm	continually writing bad stuff is a good way to learn
2022-03-14 21:17:29	nihilazo	I'm good at coding, in the narrow sense, terrible at writing programs
2022-03-14 21:17:32	@vilmibm	sorry re-writing
2022-03-14 21:17:35	@vilmibm	continually re-writing*
2022-03-14 21:17:36	nihilazo	dzwdz: yeah but I want to do that
2022-03-14 21:17:41	dzwdz	then do that
2022-03-14 21:17:46	nihilazo	because as I start wanting to make bigger programs
2022-03-14 21:17:50	nihilazo	you need that
2022-03-14 21:17:54	nihilazo	idk
2022-03-14 21:18:01	nihilazo	sorry I'm having a ramble-into-online-chats-about-bs day
2022-03-14 21:18:05	dzwdz	the best way to learn how to structure programs well is to write badly structured ones and improve on them
2022-03-14 21:18:18	nihilazo	I just spent fucking ages rambling into a chat that is completely unrelated and I'm new in about education and shit

2022-03-14 21:18:40	dzwdz	want to talk?
2022-03-14 21:19:03	nihilazo	nah it's fine I'm just questioning every fucking life choice I've ever made and am making and feeling like all of them were bad and any future choice is bad
2022-03-14 21:19:05	nihilazo	the usual
2022-03-14 21:19:08	nihilazo	just a monday night
2022-03-14 21:21:20	dzwdz	half the computers in my school broke over the weekend
2022-03-14 21:21:33	dzwdz	but i don't think i had anything to do with it this time
2022-03-14 21:22:25	@vilmibm	nihilazo: sorry that's what your brain is up to <3 i know the feeling

2022-03-14 21:43:04	bx	guess not
2022-03-14 21:44:51	dzwdz	so i've got a quick and dirty prototype of the timetracker working
2022-03-14 21:45:08	dzwdz	it doesn't count time across sessions but i do have a timer in the upper right
2022-03-14 21:45:09	bx	o?

2022-03-14 21:46:52	dzwdz	this was suprisingly simple tbh
2022-03-14 21:47:52	bx	Oh it changes gur title
2022-03-14 21:47:54	bx	clever
2022-03-14 21:50:22	dzwdz	now will this be good or bad for my wellbeing
2022-03-14 21:51:12	bx	try it
2022-03-14 21:51:17	bx	if it works out bad ditch it
2022-03-14 21:51:24	dzwdz	that's the plan
2022-03-14 21:51:33	@vilmibm	jmjl: re: compilation, i've had these problems too. try messing with the GOMAXPROCS env variable.
2022-03-14 21:51:42	nihilazo	so many things in sm64 feel familiar
2022-03-14 21:51:48	nihilazo	I swear I must have played this game before
2022-03-14 21:51:50	dzwdz	vilmibm: is there something like a global user profile?
2022-03-14 21:51:52	nihilazo	I think I played sm64ds
2022-03-14 21:51:57	nihilazo	so everything feels similar but different
2022-03-14 21:51:57	dzwdz	s/profile/.profile
2022-03-14 21:51:58	sedbot	<dzwdz> vilmibm: is there something like a global user .profile?
2022-03-14 21:52:01	nihilazo	and I played it a long long time ago
2022-03-14 21:52:16	dzwdz	it could be appended there
2022-03-14 21:52:22	@vilmibm	dzwdz: i don't think so, whatever is in /etc/skel just gets copied for new users
2022-03-14 21:52:35	@vilmibm	also people use various shells that manage environment variables differently
2022-03-14 21:52:56	dzwdz	but those shells usually don't clear the variables that are already set
2022-03-14 21:53:09	dzwdz	so i was thinking that maybe there's a way to set the variables before the shell launches
2022-03-14 21:53:17	elly	many shells (most?) source /etc/profile before ~/.profile also
2022-03-14 21:53:31	elly	ksh does, which is why this happens:
2022-03-14 21:53:32	elly	$ ssh tilde
2022-03-14 21:53:32	elly	/etc/profile[23]: .[180]: local: local can only be used in a function
2022-03-14 21:53:42	dzwdz	i don't think fish does?
2022-03-14 21:53:45	dzwdz	lemme check
2022-03-14 21:53:48	@vilmibm	ah
2022-03-14 21:55:22	dzwdz	well as far as strace output goes
2022-03-14 21:55:30	dzwdz	apparently none of the shells ever read profile files
2022-03-14 21:56:04	dzwdz	eh i'm too lazy to figure this out
2022-03-14 21:56:05	elly	only login shells do so generally
2022-03-14 21:56:13	dzwdz	oh
2022-03-14 21:56:23	dzwdz	so i'm not using strace incorrectly, then
2022-03-14 21:56:47	elly	tilde$ strace -o ~/bash.trace bash --login
2022-03-14 21:56:47	elly	elly@tilde:~$ logout
2022-03-14 21:56:47	elly	tilde$ grep '"/etc/profile"' ~/bash.trace
2022-03-14 21:56:47	elly	openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/profile", O_RDONLY) = 3
2022-03-14 21:57:34	dzwdz	also i've just checked and apparently fish indeed doesn't care about profile files
2022-03-14 21:58:02	dzwdz	it's kinda weird that the shell is supposed to parse /etc/profile
2022-03-14 21:58:28	elly	is it?
2022-03-14 21:58:42	elly	looks like fish uses /etc/fish/config.fish instead
2022-03-14 21:58:45	dzwdz	for the environment variables, at least
2022-03-14 21:59:23	elly	what do you mean?
2022-03-14 21:59:33	dzwdz	if they were set before the shell was launched then it'd work even on non-posix shells such as fish
2022-03-14 21:59:48	dzwdz	granted this isn't what /etc/profile was really made for
2022-03-14 22:00:09	dzwdz	wow i'm explaining my point in a terrible way
2022-03-14 22:00:44	dzwdz	if the environment variables were set before the shell was launched, then the shell wouldn't need to parse /etc/profile to have the correct environment for the system
2022-03-14 22:00:45	 *	bx logs off to werk
2022-03-14 22:00:54	elly	dzwdz: it doesn't need to and they are
2022-03-14 22:01:21	dzwdz	is there a config file for those?
2022-03-14 22:02:48	elly	the shell will inherit the value of PATH from your sshd, I think
2022-03-14 22:02:55	elly	which in turn gets it from... no idea
2022-03-14 22:03:03	dzwdz	its own environment?
2022-03-14 22:03:08	elly	probably
2022-03-14 22:03:24	dzwdz	systemd probably has that buried deep in a random ini file
2022-03-14 22:03:33	dzwdz	i wonder how runit does it
2022-03-14 22:03:47	@natalia	hi
2022-03-14 22:03:49	dzwdz	\o
2022-03-14 22:04:51	dzwdz	...and the time tracking utility is complete
2022-03-14 22:04:54	dzwdz	around 40 lines of ruby
2022-03-14 22:05:27	dzwdz	wow, this was easy
2022-03-14 22:11:07	elly	what does it track?
2022-03-14 22:11:20	dzwdz	time spent in terminal stuff
2022-03-14 22:11:38	dzwdz	for example, i'm now connecting to irc with `track irc mosh pi tmux a`
2022-03-14 22:11:59	dzwdz	and now i have a timer tracking how much time i've wasted here today
2022-03-14 22:12:28	@natalia	hmmm
2022-03-14 22:13:16	@natalia	seems kinda useful what's pi do
2022-03-14 22:13:26	dzwdz	?
2022-03-14 22:13:26	@natalia	oh, sshing into a rpi probably
2022-03-14 22:13:29	dzwdz	yeah
2022-03-14 22:13:46	dzwdz	irc is used to identify the thing that i'm doing
2022-03-14 22:14:05	dzwdz	so after i restart something it doesn't lose count
2022-03-14 22:14:11	@natalia	what happens when several programs use it at once
2022-03-14 22:14:15	elly	how does it tell when you're looking at irc?
2022-03-14 22:14:34	dzwdz	it doesn't, that isn't the point
2022-03-14 22:14:47	dzwdz	the point is that irc is usually a distraction from work
2022-03-14 22:15:07	dzwdz	if it's open i constantly peek at it
2022-03-14 22:15:53	elly	ah
2022-03-14 22:15:58	dzwdz	https://github.com/dzwdz/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.bin/track
2022-03-14 22:16:02	dzwdz	in case anyone wants this hack
2022-03-14 22:16:26	dzwdz	i didn't even bother cleaning up the code
2022-03-14 22:17:06	dzwdz	also printing escape codes with tui stuff running seems like it should break stuff, so use at your own risk

2022-03-14 22:28:24	katie	in my experience i've found people tend to give more detail than necessary when they feel they don't have a lot of autonomy

2022-03-14 22:28:34	elly	katie: yeah, indeed
2022-03-14 22:28:37	extratone	that's insightful...
2022-03-14 22:28:43	elly	or (I suspect in this case) when he thinks I don't trust him
2022-03-14 22:28:49	elly	so he's trying to "show his work" a lot
2022-03-14 22:28:58	elly	I am trying to figure out how to get out of that mode
2022-03-14 22:29:35	katie	give him a broad but inconsequential project then disappear for a week

2022-03-14 23:22:19	extratone	does anyone have any particular interest in shooting some shit with me in a Twitter Space.
2022-03-14 23:26:05	extratone	I would be surprised if yes but just in case. https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1jMJgeYAyjbKL
2022-03-14 23:58:42	twee	went to go see the batman impromptu
2022-03-14 23:58:49	twee	was pretty worth it
2022-03-15 00:07:50	extratone	nice, Twee. is it really Batman vs a streamer? lol
2022-03-15 00:08:53	twee	extratone: that is the primary plot, yes
2022-03-15 00:25:51	twee	also today i enabled tlp and went from charging around twice in an 11-6 study sesh to plugging in now
2022-03-15 00:26:11	twee	usually i plug in around 35%, today i plugged in at 15% but im still impressed
2022-03-15 00:30:56	extratone	I forgot about tlp!
2022-03-15 00:31:54	extratone	that's very impressive, especially considering Linux is supposed to be too power hungry to be untethered, right?
2022-03-15 00:32:34	extratone	((all of the original linux stereotypes are now like... inverted comparitively but everyone behaves as if nothing has changed.))
2022-03-15 00:32:58	extratone	sorry nobody needs that rant.
2022-03-15 00:34:59	twee	preaching to the choir :)
2022-03-15 00:35:12	twee	this laptop is a core m one, so it's fanless and all
2022-03-15 00:35:24	twee	i don't really know what made the battery life improve quite so much
2022-03-15 00:35:47	twee	oh i didn't use it for a few hours between 6 and now
2022-03-15 00:35:59	twee	this is very unscientific
2022-03-15 00:36:51	twee	tbh i get like 4hrs on my thinkpad x200, i haven't put tlp on that but that's pretty impressive imo
2022-03-15 00:42:07	extratone	whoa! is that with the original battery?
2022-03-15 00:51:30	twee	not sure
2022-03-15 00:51:44	twee	like in haven't replaced it, but it was pretty healthy when i got it
2022-03-15 00:51:47	twee	last year
2022-03-15 00:51:52	twee	or the year before

2022-03-15 03:54:39	m455	flowercorpse: ohhh what do you mean by encodings in this context?
2022-03-15 03:55:38	flowercorpse	like there are letters in it which aren't native to english, so they just get switched out to usually seemingly random ascii characters every single time they write my name on some document
2022-03-15 03:56:10	m455	ohhh!
2022-03-15 03:56:23	m455	that sucks!

2022-03-15 10:59:05	nihilazo	phenomenology of gender sounds like an interesting topic
2022-03-15 11:09:26	dzwdz	bought myself dracula on the charity event
2022-03-15 11:09:41	dzwdz	well, the book, not the actual dude
2022-03-15 11:09:45	dzwdz	sadly
2022-03-15 11:10:28	nihilazo	still cool
2022-03-15 11:22:27	猫	good book that
2022-03-15 11:23:22	dzwdz	i offered to pay 100pln for it and another book (both used btw) and the dude was terrified
2022-03-15 11:23:47	dzwdz	he said that he feels bad selling them for so much and offered 20pln
2022-03-15 11:23:50	dzwdz	like
2022-03-15 11:24:02	dzwdz	i don't think that's how negotiation works lmao
2022-03-15 11:24:16	nihilazo	"we begin our epic six part series on Henry Kissinger: the Forest Gump of war crimes"
2022-03-15 11:24:18	nihilazo	wow
2022-03-15 11:24:20	nihilazo	6 parts
2022-03-15 11:24:41	nihilazo	somebody has to be really shitty to get 6 parts on behind the bastards
2022-03-15 11:24:50	nihilazo	dzwdz: that's not how negotiation works, but also cheap books
2022-03-15 11:25:04	dzwdz	it's a damn charity event
2022-03-15 11:25:22	nihilazo	o, yeah
2022-03-15 11:25:39	nihilazo	100pln is a lot for 2 used books but for a charity thing I'd understand it
2022-03-15 11:30:12	dzwdz	i wish there was more stuff to pick up
2022-03-15 11:47:07	login	what's the exchange rate with aud?
2022-03-15 11:51:32	login	1 aud = 3.1 pln
2022-03-15 11:51:46	login	100 pln would be 100/3.1 aud = 33 aud
2022-03-15 11:52:25	login	Why is Henry Kissinger called the Forest Gump of war crimes?
2022-03-15 11:52:34	login	Forest Gump = lucky person right?
2022-03-15 11:55:50	nihilazo	idk
2022-03-15 11:55:58	nihilazo	he did a lot of war crimse

2022-03-15 14:40:36	dzwdz	oh cmon i literally wanted to start working on mine today
2022-03-15 14:40:46	dzwdz	are you making that imageboard for anything in particular?
2022-03-15 14:41:00	dzwdz	ok i phrased that badly - are you going to host it?
2022-03-15 14:41:02	twee	fun and experimentation
2022-03-15 14:41:04	twee	i intend to host it
2022-03-15 14:41:10	twee	it doesn't actually have images so dont worry
2022-03-15 14:41:15	twee	textboard, but inspired by imageboards
2022-03-15 14:41:27	twee	why, whats yours?
2022-03-15 14:41:27	dzwdz	yeah i wanted to work on a textboard
2022-03-15 14:41:32	twee	oop
2022-03-15 14:41:54	dzwdz	i'll host it as a hidden service
2022-03-15 14:42:12	twee	:(
2022-03-15 14:42:14	dzwdz	like it's also going to be inspired by the current tor chans out there - i like nanochan's layout
2022-03-15 14:42:16	dzwdz	it's just that
2022-03-15 14:42:45	dzwdz	i'm not aware of a single chan that's exclusively a hidden service which isn't fascist
2022-03-15 14:46:19	<--	lown (lown@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
2022-03-15 14:51:39	twee	feel like there's a reason for that
2022-03-15 14:52:04	dzwdz	note the exclusively part
2022-03-15 14:52:30	dzwdz	there are leftist chans which are hidden services, but they also have clearnet access
2022-03-15 14:52:40	dzwdz	also there probably are such chans, and i'm not aware of them
2022-03-15 14:53:13	dzwdz	if you make such a chan public it will probably get flooded with fascists someday
2022-03-15 14:53:40	juspib	notice how a large part of imageboard sites are chans? kinda sussy
2022-03-15 14:54:53	dzwdz	i'm thinking about just storing all the posts in my bbs as text files
2022-03-15 14:55:41	dzwdz	because there'd be no central post counter you'd address them like >>123/1
2022-03-15 14:55:44	dzwdz	which could be confusing i guess
2022-03-15 14:57:41	juspib	don't get it
2022-03-15 14:57:55	dzwdz	eh nvm
2022-03-15 14:58:08	juspib	did you mean "storing all the threads as text files"?
2022-03-15 14:58:26	kirch	I used to know of 1 (one) leftist chan, but I forgot what it was called.... so now I stick to lainchan (and only occasionally)
2022-03-15 14:58:51	dzwdz	leftypol, perhaps?
2022-03-15 14:59:04	kirch	I think it had "red" in the name, but IDK

2022-03-15 17:51:17	extratone	to recognize iOS developers who maintain bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone, basically.

2022-03-15 17:51:53	extratone	this is not actually a thing for anyone but myself and like 3 people lol
2022-03-15 17:52:24	extratone	that I talk to, anyway, but every dev I've sent it to so far seems to be at least somewhat delighted.
2022-03-15 17:54:14	jmjl	I quite like the "1 of FEW" text...
2022-03-15 17:56:53	juspib	does iOS not have built-in bluetooth keyboard support?

2022-03-15 17:58:19	juspib	oh extratone you mean actual iOS devs, i thought you meant iOS app devs
2022-03-15 17:58:32	m455	i've used an ipad with bluetooth keyboard, not sure if that's also iOS
2022-03-15 17:59:03	astrinaut	i use a bluetooth keyboard with my iphone for years now

2022-03-15 18:03:31	@natalia	abstract: Despite our best efforts, the human race still finds itself needing to edit computer files. In this paper we  demonstrate how the standard text editor ed(1) can be adapted into an IRC-based collaborative editor, paralleling modern IDEs such as Google Docs.
2022-03-15 18:04:31	elly	lol
2022-03-15 18:04:41	elly	screen -x + vi!
2022-03-15 18:04:42	elly	the dream
2022-03-15 18:05:52	@natalia	huh, didn't know about -x. is that easier to do permissions with than modern variants like tmux? (tmux sharing is kind of a pain tbh)
2022-03-15 18:07:29	elly	hm, I've never tried to use it across users
2022-03-15 18:17:57	dzwdz	hmm
2022-03-15 18:18:12	dzwdz	is there something like a visual ed frontend
2022-03-15 18:19:09	dzwdz	like, it'd let you edit files visually while in the background it'd convert everything to ed commands
2022-03-15 18:22:44	@natalia	what would be teh benefit of converting to ed commands
2022-03-15 18:23:03	@natalia	sam(1) is also not ed, *but* it provides simultaneous visual and command-based editing
2022-03-15 18:27:35	dzwdz	i could connect it to an irc client and use it as a frontend for your bot
2022-03-15 18:33:12	tomasino	an ed visual mode? like.... vi?
2022-03-15 18:33:26	dzwdz	vi doesn't work as an edward frontend
2022-03-15 18:37:21	elly	vi in ex mode kinda does though
2022-03-15 18:39:42	dzwdz	how so?
2022-03-15 18:40:26	@natalia	i think a visual frontend to my irc bot would not work well because you are not guaranteed information on things and requesting it might be dangerous (you can't just 1,$p a 1000 line file over irc)
2022-03-15 18:40:42	dzwdz	yeah i'd just request the part that i'm working on
2022-03-15 18:40:49	dzwdz	it could also reconstruct the file based on prior logs
2022-03-15 18:44:58	elly	ex mode is line oriented but exposes a lot of the power of vi, and in particular I think you can feed vi ex mod commands while it's running
2022-03-15 18:54:00	tomasino	it was a joke. Bill Joy built ex as a superset of ed, and then vi was the "visual interface to ex"

2022-03-15 19:27:02	bx	I looks complicated though, my brother's course work has it for mathy expressions
2022-03-15 19:27:14	dozens	i've done markdown -> pandoc -> pdf, which i think uses latex. but i've never touched the stuff myself.
2022-03-15 19:27:55	nihilazo	the thing that bugs me about it is the difficulty of changing the format in a bunch of ways
2022-03-15 19:28:29	bx	I think i'd rather leave mathy expressions to vector graphics

2022-03-15 19:44:34	extratone	sorry about that juspip and astrinaut - I did mean app devs. and yes, iPhone does support bluetooth keyboards. but it is not equal (at the system level) with iPadOS and most devs completely overlook it.
2022-03-15 19:44:50	dzwdz	sounds like apple's fault
2022-03-15 19:44:57	extratone	juspib*
2022-03-15 19:45:18	extratone	it is apple's fault. have I not shown you the epic joke dev form post of mine?
2022-03-15 19:45:44	extratone	https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/685201
2022-03-15 19:46:24	extratone	astrinaut I am VERY curious to know more about your iPhone keyboarding but you don't necessarily have to indulge me.
2022-03-15 19:47:26	extratone	the essence of that thread: me: let's acknowledge that iPad and iPhone are not 100% parallel in bt keyboard support before I ask where I might find keyboard shortcuts tables for your native apps pertaining to iPhone specifically.

2022-03-15 19:50:01	extratone	the fact that they don't even identify themselves by name on the developer forums lmao.... 
2022-03-15 19:53:30	bx	i mean i wouldnt want to if i was one of them
2022-03-15 19:53:43	bx	im sure *some* of them are harbouring shame

2022-03-15 19:56:50	extratone	I don't know why, but this one issue has somehow managed to radicalize me and like... get me kicked out of chats lol
2022-03-15 19:57:51	extratone	something to do with the fact that it would *maybe* take one person a single afternoon to publish two-column tables of keyboard shortcuts but the wealthiest company in the world couldn't be bothered.
2022-03-15 19:57:56	dzwdz	it's good that devs aren't identified
2022-03-15 19:58:00	dzwdz	they aren't the ones to blame anyways
2022-03-15 19:58:00	extratone	(and now I'm stopping myself, I'm sorry.)
2022-03-15 19:58:03	bx	sometimes something is so dumb it like, inspires rage
2022-03-15 19:58:11	dzwdz	it'd shift blame from apple as a wider entity to individual devs who haven't done shit
2022-03-15 19:58:18	bx	True
2022-03-15 19:58:49	extratone	I have zero interest in blame... I literally just want... the tables lol
2022-03-15 19:59:56	dzwdz	then what good are the identities of devs
2022-03-15 20:01:23	kindrobot	A developer has no name.
2022-03-15 20:01:24	extratone	I didn't ask for any! I just said it's absurd.
2022-03-15 20:02:42	extratone	I am way out of my element - I don't even know how I was allowed to publish on the develop forums given I am not a registered developer.
2022-03-15 20:03:14	bx	...
2022-03-15 20:03:17	bx	it was fate
2022-03-15 20:04:29	bx	i think i might actually go to bed early for once
2022-03-15 20:04:38	extratone	I am literally just looking for the shortcuts tables. two columns - command, action. max of 10 apps, all Apple's.

2022-03-16 02:03:52	flowercorpse	oh hi malvarma
2022-03-16 02:04:17	malvarma	flowercorpse: o/
2022-03-16 02:04:22	malvarma	how are you flowercorpse
2022-03-16 02:05:06	flowercorpse	I'm okay, kinda tired. What about you?
2022-03-16 02:06:20	malvarma	too much energy. just finished watching "stalked by my doctor 3: patients revenge" and it was a thrill ride
2022-03-16 02:08:32	extratone	lmao.
2022-03-16 02:08:57	malvarma	yo it was crazy
2022-03-16 02:09:18	malvarma	i dont wanna do spoilers, but you think its one thing, but then its another.
2022-03-16 02:09:52	malvarma	eric roberts also has scenes where he talks to his other personality, who wears a hawaiian shirt and drinks bloody marys all day
2022-03-16 02:11:10	malvarma	speaking of being tired, i hear the US may soon eliminate clock switching and enter permanent daylight savings time
2022-03-16 02:16:14	flowercorpse	"stalked by my doctor 3: patients revenge" sounds like something that would be a made up movie in an other movie
2022-03-16 02:19:18	malvarma	oh no its very real
2022-03-16 02:19:39	malvarma	and there are apparently 2 further sequels i havent seen yet!
2022-03-16 02:20:23	extratone	well, at least it sounds like some sort of equilibrium was achieved from that title
2022-03-16 02:20:42	malvarma	they are lifetime movies i think? but they lean more to the ridiculous side. im also a fan of Vivica A. Fox and David DeCotaeu's "The Wrong" series which is similar in some respects
2022-03-16 02:30:42	extratone	sortof on that note - Titanic Day is exactly one month from today! I encourage you all to try my tradition of watching both Titanic AND Titanic II
2022-03-16 02:33:50	elly	there's a Titanic II?
2022-03-16 02:39:41	malvarma	woah
2022-03-16 02:39:43	malvarma	there is?
2022-03-16 02:40:13	malvarma	oh yeah! wacky disaster movie
2022-03-16 02:41:00	malvarma	I prefer this one though: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_the_Titanic
2022-03-16 02:44:12	agafnd	Get ready for the Aclockalypse: coming this fall!
2022-03-16 02:45:06	flowercorpse	it's an ...italian anime?
2022-03-16 02:46:09	malvarma	even better flowercorpse i think it was animated in north korea
2022-03-16 02:46:14	flowercorpse	WHAT
2022-03-16 02:46:43	malvarma	agafnd: well hopefully, if the house passes it. I just nagged my congressperson
2022-03-16 02:47:00	malvarma	but it would start november 2023 to give everyone time to plan
2022-03-16 02:47:20	malvarma	yeah i wasn't sure how that movie bypassed the sanctions... maybe its different for italy and animators
2022-03-16 02:48:58	malvarma	but it was animated by a studio based on pyonyang, which is also known for making very propagandistic / indoctrination cartoons for kids
2022-03-16 02:51:21	flowercorpse	how did it even came to be though
2022-03-16 02:51:32	flowercorpse	was north korea less isolated in the 2000s?
2022-03-16 02:52:59	extratone	I think so? if I remember correctly. and omg malvarma I need to see that...
2022-03-16 02:53:02	malvarma	well they do have companies that are allowed to operate, and they apparently export something. i know they operate a chain of restaurants around the world, for instance. and there are a few places where north and south have some kind of trade, as an experiment
2022-03-16 02:54:06	malvarma	extratone: even better is the sequel, "tentacolino"

2022-03-16 02:58:47	agafnd	God I remember just a bit ago finding the youtube channel of some italian studio...
2022-03-16 02:58:47	extratone	that is legitimately the most clever bot idea I've ever seen omg.
2022-03-16 02:58:59	agafnd	who i think may have collaborated with north korean animation studios....
2022-03-16 02:59:04	asm	hello
2022-03-16 02:59:06	agafnd	they had the most cursed looking childrens shows
2022-03-16 02:59:21	agafnd	there was a treasure island thing which looked halfway acceptable from the thumbnails
2022-03-16 02:59:32	agafnd	but if you actually watched any of it the CGI was horrifying
2022-03-16 03:00:27	malvarma	agafnd it wasn't pound puppies, wasn't it?
2022-03-16 03:01:05	agafnd	fuckin
2022-03-16 03:01:07	agafnd	this
2022-03-16 03:01:09	agafnd	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYXievo3ibiVSDC1VyZ7ui1TsRXyePJfp
2022-03-16 03:01:16	malvarma	this korean studio made a bunch of stuff with Mondo TV in italy and i think it was generally low quality. But they have also worked on some bigger projects (the simpsons movie, no joke) and the animation isnt always bad
2022-03-16 03:01:40	agafnd	Mondo TV!
2022-03-16 03:01:41	malvarma	oh this looks like some great trash!
2022-03-16 03:01:51	agafnd	yeah! that's the same as what made this treasure island thing
2022-03-16 03:02:31	agafnd	for some reason their youtube channel is called "CARTOON CHANNEL"
2022-03-16 03:02:40	agafnd	last time i checked it was called "MONDO WORLD" i think
2022-03-16 03:02:52	malvarma	oh these characters are so stiff
2022-03-16 03:03:36	malvarma	this looks like bad machinima
2022-03-16 03:03:53	flowercorpse	interestingly enough in my home country the quality of animated media was amazing during socialism
2022-03-16 03:04:45	malvarma	well, i guess north korea didnt get any of that socialist animation magic!
2022-03-16 03:05:22	malvarma	any good animations you would recomend?
2022-03-16 03:06:01	agafnd	IDK if this treasure island is NK-animated. Might just be italian
2022-03-16 03:06:09	malvarma	hmm i dont think this pirate show was the same studio. but boy is it bad. and some of the character designs make me very unconfortable
2022-03-16 03:06:44	malvarma	hmm a shame about italian cartoons then. but their movies, in the 70s and 80s, were glorious
2022-03-16 03:06:44	agafnd	it says "RAI Fiction" and "Mondo TV: The Dream Factory" at the start
2022-03-16 03:08:22	malvarma	i think RAI is just another italian studio
2022-03-16 03:08:33	malvarma	interesting, i cant find out much about this show
2022-03-16 03:09:09	agafnd	yeah like
2022-03-16 03:09:25	agafnd	did they just have 12 italian guys shit out 28 episodes of treasure island
2022-03-16 03:09:30	agafnd	for....  tax purposes or something?
2022-03-16 03:09:58	malvarma	good question. italy seems to have cornered the market on these kinds of awful shows.
2022-03-16 03:11:27	flowercorpse	malvarma: I think the most well internationally well known one is Son of the White Mare
2022-03-16 03:12:20	malvarma	woah this looks beautiful

2022-03-16 03:14:11	agafnd	oh TeX is a whole.........thing
2022-03-16 03:14:15	agafnd	when it comes to packages
2022-03-16 03:14:34	agafnd	like the full TeX Live is huge
2022-03-16 03:14:35	@natalia	its relatively easy just getting my own local repository but i dont want to use a ton of space on the town
2022-03-16 03:14:37	@natalia	yeah
2022-03-16 03:14:38	malvarma	flowercorpse: i have put this on my list of good movies to twatch
2022-03-16 03:14:48	malvarma	that list is a lot shorter than my list of bad movies to watch
2022-03-16 03:14:53	flowercorpse	ahahah
2022-03-16 03:15:26	agafnd	WHY IS THERE A texlive-games PACKAGE
2022-03-16 03:15:49	@natalia	LOL
2022-03-16 03:15:50	agafnd	oh it's for typesetting game manuals and chess games and stuff
2022-03-16 03:15:56	agafnd	that makes sense
2022-03-16 03:16:28	agafnd	you know because i've always wanted to write about rubik's cube configurations in TeX
2022-03-16 03:17:21	agafnd	.......MusixTeX

2022-03-16 03:18:26	agafnd	no wonder it's Like That
2022-03-16 03:18:43	@natalia	really i guess we should install tex live outside of debian's package manager
2022-03-16 03:20:02	flowercorpse	malvarma: the plot is a folk tale, but very strange
2022-03-16 03:20:57	malvarma	strange can be good. makes sense that its about horses too
2022-03-16 03:21:09	malvarma	being a folk tale
2022-03-16 03:22:26	flowercorpse	it supposedly has roots in eurasia, with nomadic groups, so horses make even more sense

2022-03-16 09:52:21	juspib	yesterday there was the talk about ios with bt kbds and now i'm considering getting some cheapo smol keyboard for my phone to actually write code comfortably on it
2022-03-16 09:53:26	twee	im still upset about blackberry ending
2022-03-16 09:57:51	twee	i hope that as linux phone stuff takes off someone makes a blackberry passport phone
2022-03-16 10:07:32	nihilazo	hi twee!
2022-03-16 10:09:01	nihilazo	I'm very sceptical of linux phone stuff. But it would be nice to have a mobile OS that wasn't corporately controlled
2022-03-16 10:14:33	twee	yeah im sceptical of linux phone stuff
2022-03-16 10:14:39	twee	sort of
2022-03-16 10:15:01	nihilazo	I had a linux tablet for a year, it was a mess and basically no progress was being made
2022-03-16 10:15:11	twee	yeah
2022-03-16 10:15:17	nihilazo	and the community also suffers from the same bullshit problems that plague linux at large
2022-03-16 10:15:36	nihilazo	a bunch of small groups all independently trying to work on solving the same problem and making incompatible stuff
2022-03-16 10:15:41	twee	kind of exhausted of linux community
2022-03-16 10:15:49	nihilazo	yeah same
2022-03-16 10:16:10	twee	then again, if there was a passport sized phone with square display and physical keyboard, i probably would make it my primary computer
2022-03-16 10:16:24	nihilazo	the linux phone community is very full of "screw you guys, I'm going to make my OWN desktop environment, with blackjack and hookers!"
2022-03-16 10:17:06	nihilazo	I'd love to have a good modern palmtop. I like that form factor
2022-03-16 10:17:13	nihilazo	loved my psion 5
2022-03-16 10:17:25	lown	psion 5 was where it was AT
2022-03-16 10:17:36	nihilazo	I used a 5mx as my primary portable computer for a good year or so
2022-03-16 10:17:38	nihilazo	then it broke
2022-03-16 10:17:41	lown	i sold mine ages ago
2022-03-16 10:17:45	lown	was a shame
2022-03-16 10:18:01	twee	is there a good way to run apks on linux
2022-03-16 10:18:01	nihilazo	and I got it fixed, afterwards realised that I had no use for it any more because my college demanded that student devices be connected to microsoft teams
2022-03-16 10:18:09	nihilazo	so sold it
2022-03-16 10:18:10	twee	cuz ive just realised, there a few apps i do need
2022-03-16 10:18:17	nihilazo	anbox?
2022-03-16 10:18:21	nihilazo	idk how stable it is rn
2022-03-16 10:18:22	twee	im actually tempted by the unihertz titan pocket
2022-03-16 10:18:27	twee	if lineage could be put on it
2022-03-16 10:19:48	nihilazo	I've been burned by every mobile/portable computing thing I ever bought into
2022-03-16 10:20:24	lown	my fave portable microcomputer so far is the sensor watch
2022-03-16 10:20:29	nihilazo	android smartphones, linux tablets, weird unique devices, the small-dedicated-machines approach (which is the one I am using right now, keeping a basic phone seperate from an mp3 player and other stuff etc)
2022-03-16 10:20:31	lown	exactly as much functionality as anyone needs
2022-03-16 10:20:53	lown	what's your basic phone?
2022-03-16 10:21:24	nihilazo	nokia 105 (2019)
2022-03-16 10:21:26	nihilazo	it's kinda bad
2022-03-16 10:21:44	nihilazo	cheap trash, the kind of thing that exists to be a burner phone for drug dealers pretty much
2022-03-16 10:22:00	nihilazo	but I was forced into buying something new instead of a better phone second-hand
2022-03-16 10:24:01	twee	things i like about having an android phone, albeit a tiny one, is anki and organic maps
2022-03-16 10:24:04	twee	that's about it
2022-03-16 10:24:15	twee	oh also wechat
2022-03-16 10:24:34	twee	which i don't like, but i use a fair bit, and if i do end up in china next year i've basically got no choice but to use it
2022-03-16 10:24:40	twee	which means android phone is a necessity
2022-03-16 10:24:56	twee	the great thing about it is though, no google play services dependency
2022-03-16 10:25:00	nihilazo	I've been interested by like, symbian phones recently
2022-03-16 10:25:14	nihilazo	the pre-iphone smartphone model that was more like a PDA-phone than what we think of now as a smartphone
2022-03-16 10:25:36	nihilazo	but by having and using one, I'm just asking to have my phone become unusable soon because they're on old network standards
2022-03-16 10:30:16	 *	nihilazo still wants to fix his mp3 player, using a DS as an mp3 player is janky as hell
2022-03-16 10:30:22	twee	2g is gonna stay around for a solid while, in the uk at least
2022-03-16 10:30:37	nihilazo	I do really like the DS (DS lite specifically) as a device
2022-03-16 10:30:46	twee	honestly i think blackberry was a great model, the blackberry classic was a great phone, bb10 was a great os
2022-03-16 10:30:47	nihilazo	it's a really well designed form factor
2022-03-16 10:30:58	nihilazo	but just a games machine really
2022-03-16 10:31:04	nihilazo	I never really used blackberry devices
2022-03-16 10:31:08	twee	i got my granddads blackberry classic when he died, i wish it wasn't locked to orange and i appreciate it more - all i wanted phoens for then was games
2022-03-16 10:31:08	dzwdz	y'all really like gsm, huh
2022-03-16 10:31:25	dzwdz	meanwhile i think i could use a phone without a sim card at all
2022-03-16 10:31:45	twee	i dont like gsm, i just think it's fine
2022-03-16 10:31:54	twee	because i care less about security than you and it works very well
2022-03-16 10:32:06	twee	i couldn't because my phone is primarily a call/sms device
2022-03-16 10:32:12	dzwdz	it's not even that i care about security a lot
2022-03-16 10:32:13	twee	nihilazo: i do like the ds
2022-03-16 10:32:28	dzwdz	it's just that when people call me they usually do it via discord or whatever
2022-03-16 10:33:04	dzwdz	i do see the appeal of dumb phones though
2022-03-16 10:34:09	nihilazo	I have a dumb phone, I recommend(?) it
2022-03-16 10:34:12	nihilazo	like, I don't like smartphones
2022-03-16 10:34:20	nihilazo	but also with having a dumbphone you are reliant on other devices as well
2022-03-16 10:34:32	dzwdz	i don't think i'd even want a phone that much if not for school
2022-03-16 10:34:37	nihilazo	I carry 2 or 3 different devices with me most of the time (phone, ebook reader, mp3 player)
2022-03-16 10:34:43	dzwdz	its primary use is killing time
2022-03-16 10:35:10	 *	dzwdz left his ebook reader at his grandparents' 2 weeks ago :(
2022-03-16 10:35:57	twee	ive had three (i think) e readers, and broke them all :/
2022-03-16 10:36:00	twee	now i use paper
2022-03-16 10:36:06	twee	and its somewhat more convenient
2022-03-16 10:36:15	twee	s/con/incon
2022-03-16 10:36:16	sedbot	<twee> and its somewhat more inconvenient
2022-03-16 10:36:20	twee	but worth it
2022-03-16 10:36:20	dzwdz	ebook readers and smartphones fill a different niche though
2022-03-16 10:36:37	dzwdz	eh, i'm not a fan of paper books
2022-03-16 10:37:17	nihilazo	if I had a smartphone I'd still carry an ebook reader
2022-03-16 10:37:38	nihilazo	but I still carry a phone and mp3 player and those would be one device if I had a smartphone. And I'd be able to check live bus times
2022-03-16 10:37:53	nihilazo	but that's the only thing that I would want from a smartphone that I can't do with what I use. check live bus times.
2022-03-16 10:37:57	juspib	duolingo be like "you better be careful to not lose that one day streak!"
2022-03-16 10:38:04	nihilazo	and I can just ask somebody else at the bus stop to check that
2022-03-16 10:38:06	nihilazo	so it's fine
2022-03-16 10:38:16	nihilazo	soon I might end up needing a smartphone at uni or whatever
2022-03-16 10:38:22	nihilazo	but I'm trying not to get one

2022-03-16 10:41:09	juspib	linux phones are cool if you like privacy, butfor functionality you can just use termux
2022-03-16 10:44:40	nihilazo	linux phones are cool if you like jank
2022-03-16 10:45:04	nihilazo	and community infighting, low compatibility (even with itself) and duplicated effort
2022-03-16 10:45:16	nihilazo	(in my experience with a linux tablet, which is not a phone but still mobile linux)
2022-03-16 10:45:30	nihilazo	if anything phones are worse bc you have to deal with the modem
2022-03-16 10:45:41	twee	nihilazo: in york, if you have the bus app bus tickets are half price
2022-03-16 10:45:50	twee	that's the only uni specific thing i use my smartphone for
2022-03-16 10:48:50	juspib	twee that's sad
2022-03-16 11:04:08	nihilazo	same here, cheaper tickets if you use the app
2022-03-16 11:04:13	twee	juspib: sad in what sense?
2022-03-16 11:04:19	nihilazo	although I get free busses because of disability anyway
2022-03-16 11:04:30	nihilazo	so I avoid the app
2022-03-16 11:04:33	twee	i asked them if i could get like a phsyical card they were like na
2022-03-16 11:04:38	twee	lucky
2022-03-16 11:04:41	nihilazo	ours used to have a card
2022-03-16 11:04:44	twee	not disability, but you know
2022-03-16 11:04:44	nihilazo	but then they got rid of it
2022-03-16 11:05:01	nihilazo	and the new system is shit
2022-03-16 11:05:11	nihilazo	you need to generate a QR code on your phone and it only works if you have data
2022-03-16 11:05:22	nihilazo	so we always have a bunch of people getting on the bus "my ticket isn't working"
2022-03-16 11:05:28	nihilazo	it's so terrible
2022-03-16 11:08:16	twee	yeah it's the same system
2022-03-16 11:08:25	twee	not many people it doesn't work for though
2022-03-16 11:08:34	twee	although the other day my app started repeatedly crashing as i went up
2022-03-16 11:08:39	nihilazo	looking at the sensor watch rn
2022-03-16 11:08:42	nihilazo	it's actually super neat
2022-03-16 11:08:45	twee	turned out it was struggling to display a "do you like this app?" dialog
2022-03-16 11:08:49	twee	which is the most ironic thing ever
2022-03-16 11:08:55	nihilazo	sensor watch looks like what smartwatches should be
2022-03-16 11:08:57	nihilazo	to me
2022-03-16 11:09:56	twee	that's cool
2022-03-16 11:09:59	twee	i have that watch in pink
2022-03-16 11:10:13	nihilazo	I had one in black a while ago but i don't wear a watch any more
2022-03-16 11:10:16	nihilazo	because I don't like clicks
2022-03-16 11:10:20	nihilazo	s/clicks/clocks/
2022-03-16 11:10:21	sedbot	<nihilazo> because I don't like clocks
2022-03-16 11:10:33	twee	yo it supports beat time thats cool
2022-03-16 11:10:39	nihilazo	I found that checking what time it was all the time meant that things felt like they were going slower
2022-03-16 11:10:41	twee	no me neither, i just like the aesthetic of wearing watches
2022-03-16 11:10:48	nihilazo	o fair
2022-03-16 11:10:52	nihilazo	they aren't really my thing
2022-03-16 11:10:52	twee	i wear long sleeves and that keeps me at bay
2022-03-16 11:10:55	nihilazo	but the sensor watch is neat
2022-03-16 11:11:00	twee	i have one on each wrist
2022-03-16 11:11:02	twee	sometimes two
2022-03-16 11:21:30	login	have a watch that doesn't show the tiem unless you touch it
2022-03-16 11:27:43	twee	i like the old happy meal watches with a coer
2022-03-16 11:27:45	twee	cover
2022-03-16 11:43:19	juspib	"cheaper tickets if you use the app" is another term for "more expensive tickets if you don't use the app"
2022-03-16 11:45:24	juspib	and that's sad cuz it puts you in disadvantage if you don't have your phone with you, it's discharged or you don't have one at all
2022-03-16 12:29:58	cymen	Hey townies
2022-03-16 12:30:07	cymen	how are yall doing today?

2022-03-16 13:43:01	twee	the piercer was like its a brave choice if youve only got lobes, normally people go through a few more ears, nose etc first

2022-03-16 14:02:55	<--	lown (lown@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
2022-03-16 14:05:39	barnaba	I'm having so much static electricity issues at the office. Every other time I touch a door knob etc.
2022-03-16 14:06:23	tomasino	oh dear. low humidity?
2022-03-16 14:06:28	barnaba	now I have touched my pc case a bit, did some other touching of computer hardware trying to make my other pc work (monitors and such), touched the case 15 mins later and one of us was so charged
2022-03-16 14:06:30	barnaba	I don't get it
2022-03-16 14:06:47	barnaba	like zapping myself with one of those electrical doodads from a lighter
2022-03-16 14:07:25	barnaba	dunno, nobody else experiences it, so I'm kinda suspecting something is wrong with the pc
2022-03-16 14:07:43	barnaba	but is that even possible?
2022-03-16 14:18:02	twee	itd be cool if it was
2022-03-16 14:18:09	twee	pc that can charge you up
2022-03-16 14:18:13	twee	personal charger
2022-03-16 14:18:27	barnaba	mightn't it be a grounding issue of some kind?
2022-03-16 14:29:27	login	barnaba: does it only happen with the pc case or with every metal surface?
2022-03-16 14:29:52	login	humidity is the biggest one, second biggest one is dry skin, third biggest might be shoes and carpet
2022-03-16 14:30:53	login	try moisturiser
2022-03-16 14:30:57	login	or sunscreen
2022-03-16 14:38:01	barnaba	it happens with the doorknob after I've been sitting using the pc for a while a lot
2022-03-16 14:38:11	barnaba	no carpet
2022-03-16 14:41:38	twee	well i cant send messages anymore, dont delete random shit via adb kids
2022-03-16 14:45:09	barnaba	login: no carpet here and no direct sunlight. What do I moisturize, contact points with the furniture?
2022-03-16 14:45:49	login	twee: messages where?
2022-03-16 14:46:00	barnaba	I imagine sms messages
2022-03-16 14:46:03	login	barnaba: your skin, which if dry, will not be sufficiently grounded (because of higher resistance)

2022-03-16 14:46:47	login	before you dress, after you shower and dry your skin
2022-03-16 14:46:49	barnaba	I'd google average human skin area, but don't want to get on more lists

2022-03-16 16:40:32	m455	ah yeah, when forwarding an email, i'd give some context like others said "hey, i'm just following up on an email i sent, and wanted to confirm that you received it, etc."
2022-03-16 16:42:47	dozens	if it's been a week, it's time for a follow-up. you might also consider acknowledging the medium: "Hey, just wanted to follow up on this. I know email is hard / can get buried sometimes, so let me know if you'd rather schedule a quick phone call for this afternoon or something"
2022-03-16 16:42:51	dozens	etc etc

2022-03-16 17:49:33	kindrobot	Yeah, it's been a minute. :o
2022-03-16 17:49:48	dzwdz	what's up?
2022-03-16 17:49:51	猫	Hello
2022-03-16 17:49:59	dzwdz	sup
2022-03-16 17:50:59	kindrobot	Oh, not much. I'm reducing the amount of days I'm working, so I'm going to have more time for fulfilling projects, which I'm excited about.
2022-03-16 17:51:41	bx	\o kindrobot
2022-03-16 17:51:47	kindrobot	Hey bx :)
2022-03-16 17:52:01	dzwdz	i feel asleep for 2 hours after school today, AGAIN
2022-03-16 17:52:03	dzwdz	i'm tired of this shit
2022-03-16 17:52:06	kindrobot	Hey 猫
2022-03-16 17:52:17	extratone	I am now officially a Reality Augmentor. (hint: do not touch the gold coil unless you're ready for a very loud noise.) https://tilde.town/~extratone/misc/HolisticCompliancePortal.reality
2022-03-16 17:52:19	bx	dzwdz: are you still falling onto your bed?
2022-03-16 17:52:25	kindrobot	dzwdz: litterally
2022-03-16 17:52:32	dzwdz	kindrobot: literally
2022-03-16 17:52:37	dzwdz	heh
2022-03-16 17:52:43	dzwdz	bx: i mean, yeah
2022-03-16 17:52:58	bx	i may have said this before but
2022-03-16 17:53:08	dzwdz	i don't really have much choice here
2022-03-16 17:53:11	bx	have you tried instead resting on a chair or gur floor
2022-03-16 17:53:12	kindrobot	dzwdz: is it Covid?
2022-03-16 17:53:17	dzwdz	no
2022-03-16 17:53:25	dzwdz	it's just school being a bitch
2022-03-16 17:53:28	kindrobot	Ah.
2022-03-16 17:55:31	bx	if you have gur unnatural ability to wake up to alarms
2022-03-16 17:55:37	bx	you could set one rememptively
2022-03-16 17:55:56	bx	for after youd been sleeping for an hour
2022-03-16 17:56:00	kindrobot	You might try napping too a 90 minute nap gives you a full REM cycle. When I've had to pull all-nighters, I implemented a quasi-poly-phastic sleep schedule, and it was much better than 0 sleep.
2022-03-16 17:56:34	猫	oh no you're making me want to sleep
2022-03-16 17:57:12	dzwdz	bx: i tried setting some recently but i just looked at them, decided i don't give a shit, and fell back asleep
2022-03-16 17:57:17	bx	AH
2022-03-16 17:57:30	bx	that's what i usually do, except i dont even look at it
2022-03-16 17:58:39	kindrobot	There are alarm apps that make you solve math problems to turn them off. When my dad in college, he'd put his alarm in the other room next to the coffee maker.
2022-03-16 17:59:48	bx	kindrobot: i put it away from me too, it donest help lolw
2022-03-16 18:00:06	dzwdz	i used to use them
2022-03-16 18:00:06	bx	but it stops me from turning it off subconsciously
2022-03-16 18:00:15	dzwdz	doesn't stop me from falling asleep afterwards again
2022-03-16 18:00:55	bx	s a m e
2022-03-16 18:02:09	猫	I put my alarm where I can't get to it without getting out of bed but
2022-03-16 18:02:25	猫	it happens... fairly often that my alarm goes off
2022-03-16 18:02:34	猫	I get out of bed, turn it off, immediately go back to bed
2022-03-16 18:04:36	bx	^
2022-03-16 18:05:02	猫	sometimes, I'll wake up way after my alarm should have gone off, and it will be disabled
2022-03-16 18:05:32	猫	the only thing I can think of there is that I have enough muscle memory for getting out of bed and turning my alarm off then getting back into bed it happens while I'm still mostly asleep
2022-03-16 18:05:40	猫	it's a bad habit
2022-03-16 18:06:03	bx	Yup
2022-03-16 18:06:06	猫	I'm lucky I don't have anything majorly important that's time sensitive
2022-03-16 18:06:11	猫	or I would be so doomed
2022-03-16 18:06:13	bx	I started putting it in wierd places, like in pockets
2022-03-16 18:06:17	bx	or behind books
2022-03-16 18:06:21	猫	that's a good plan
2022-03-16 18:06:31	猫	I just have mine on the floor where I can't reach it from my bed
2022-03-16 18:06:35	bx	Found my self waking up after having crawled half way too it
2022-03-16 18:06:51	bx	I sleep on gur floor, so i put it higher up
2022-03-16 18:06:52	猫	I've woken up on the floor halfway to the alarm clock before
2022-03-16 18:07:08	猫	humans are weird
2022-03-16 18:07:34	bx	yea
2022-03-16 18:07:36	dzwdz	oh you have the thing with falling asleep
2022-03-16 18:07:38	dzwdz	right
2022-03-16 18:08:06	bx	i like being wierd in my way, less so in gur generally human way
2022-03-16 18:11:29	dzwdz	humans suck
2022-03-16 18:11:43	dzwdz	just not in the way i like
2022-03-16 18:11:52	kindrobot	I'm conflicted about humans.
2022-03-16 18:12:26	bx	Yea
2022-03-16 18:12:33	bx	Some of them are really nice
2022-03-16 18:17:34	猫	I hate humans
2022-03-16 18:17:37	猫	generally speaking
2022-03-16 18:17:50	猫	even if there are some nice people, I feel like things would be better off if there were less humans
2022-03-16 18:18:00	dzwdz	stop making babies ffs
2022-03-16 18:18:08	dzwdz	we've got more than enough of us
2022-03-16 18:18:11	猫	there's too many humans
2022-03-16 18:18:28	猫	but people wanna do the sex and don't know how to have sex not equals babies
2022-03-16 18:18:48	dzwdz	> wanting to do the sex
2022-03-16 18:18:54	dzwdz	lmao imagine being that person
2022-03-16 18:19:01	bx	we should make some kind of off switch for people
2022-03-16 18:19:07	bx	like a "no babies" switch
2022-03-16 18:19:38	dzwdz	you ever played hl2?
2022-03-16 18:19:40	dzwdz	breen was based
2022-03-16 18:20:45	bx	i havent finished it and didn't pay attention but i read about gur anti conception field on gur wiki
2022-03-16 18:21:01	bx	which is a pretty novel weapon concept imo
2022-03-16 18:21:22	dzwdz	a gun where you shoot someone and they can't have any more babies
2022-03-16 18:21:30	dzwdz	yeah, you might lose the fight and die
2022-03-16 18:21:42	dzwdz	but your opponent's bloodline ends with them
2022-03-16 18:21:56	dzwdz	another perk is that it's mostly pointless against gay people
2022-03-16 18:22:01	bx	ha joke's on my opponent ive already decided it ends with me
2022-03-16 18:22:17	dzwdz	i suppose regular guns work that way too
2022-03-16 18:22:22	bx	naw
2022-03-16 18:22:27	bx	they kill people
2022-03-16 18:22:35	bx	see this one doesnt
2022-03-16 18:22:36	dzwdz	which prevents them from having babies
2022-03-16 18:22:37	juspib	many guns prevent the shot person from having babies
2022-03-16 18:22:46	juspib	yea
2022-03-16 18:22:59	bx	dzwdz: yea but this one is sideeffect free
2022-03-16 18:23:43	bx	Hmm, i might go out before gur sun goes down
2022-03-16 18:23:58	dzwdz	is there something like a reverse vampire
2022-03-16 18:24:03	dzwdz	dies without sunlight
2022-03-16 18:24:10	dzwdz	wait fuck that's just a plant
2022-03-16 18:24:18	bx	λmao
2022-03-16 18:24:46	dzwdz	now i want to read a story about a vampire falling in love with a plant human
2022-03-16 18:24:50	bx	itd be funny if i just introduced myself to people as someone who likes reverse vampires
2022-03-16 18:24:57	bx	>plant
2022-03-16 18:24:59	bx	>human
2022-03-16 18:25:15	dzwdz	that's a thing yknow
2022-03-16 18:25:20	dzwdz	https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/PlantSim
2022-03-16 18:25:32	bx	oh wow
2022-03-16 18:25:51	bx	Til
2022-03-16 18:26:22	bx	i really do like gur general robusticity of plants
2022-03-16 18:26:50	bx	that'd actually be quite nice to have as a human
2022-03-16 18:27:17	bx	though gur things that make it happen seem kinda incompatible with gur complexity that makes human things happen
2022-03-16 18:27:31	dzwdz	a plant vampire
2022-03-16 18:27:36	dzwdz	dies both without sunlight and with sunlight
2022-03-16 18:27:41	bx	.......
2022-03-16 18:27:47	dzwdz	i suppose that's a regular human
2022-03-16 18:28:00	bx	i dont think it is?
2022-03-16 18:28:07	bx	you *can* live without sunlight
2022-03-16 18:28:15	dzwdz	so then when i die
2022-03-16 18:28:18	dzwdz	i'll die without sunlight
2022-03-16 18:28:23	bx	...
2022-03-16 18:28:31	bx	i mean youre technically correct
2022-03-16 18:28:41	bx	wonder how many people die in gur day vs gur night
2022-03-16 18:29:02	dzwdz	i don't

2022-03-16 18:43:01	dzwdz	can anyone confirm
2022-03-16 18:44:43	bx	they dont die in two days
2022-03-16 18:45:01	bx	they can go as long as something outside of britain would
2022-03-16 18:45:21	dzwdz	that's what the brits want us to think

2022-03-16 19:09:32	bx	dying and resurecting based on gur rain sounds like it'd space things out a bit more, i wouldnt mind
2022-03-16 19:43:21	nihilazo	for me? about to play some bass
2022-03-16 19:43:27	nihilazo	got interviewed for a podcast by dozens
2022-03-16 19:44:22	nihilazo	trying to find some fanfic of the expanse that is interesting and not just shipping and/or porn lol
2022-03-16 19:44:38	dzwdz	you know you can filter the porn out on ao3, right
2022-03-16 19:44:38	bx	ooo more tilde podcast eps
2022-03-16 19:45:02	bx	doesnt porn fanfic automatically imply shipping
2022-03-16 19:45:05	dzwdz	(but also a fanfic isn't porn just because it had a sex scene, so don't sleep on those)
2022-03-16 19:45:05	nihilazo	yeah dzwdz but you still get all the not-really-porn-but-still-kinda-sorta-like-that fics lol
2022-03-16 19:45:13	bx	or is my def of shipping skewed
2022-03-16 19:45:20	nihilazo	just shipping fics
2022-03-16 19:45:29	dzwdz	look i was thinking that those fics were shit too
2022-03-16 19:45:44	dzwdz	but sex can be written about tastefully
2022-03-16 19:46:48	bx	^
2022-03-16 19:46:55	dzwdz	in more of a porn-for-the-soul way than porn-for-the-dick
2022-03-16 19:47:14	dzwdz	granted it's hard to find those among all the porn
2022-03-16 19:47:27	 *	bx feels like anything can potentially be written tastfully if gur writer knows this stuff
2022-03-16 19:47:38	nihilazo	the first fic that shows up when I filter the search not to contain explicit rated and shipping fics is somebody writing about amos' backstory (which is mostly written in the books and show as something that's just highly traumatic and he never wants to talk about)
2022-03-16 19:47:56	nihilazo	and somebody's just like "yeah let me write a whole fic that's just this guy's trauma"
2022-03-16 19:47:58	dzwdz	aaaah it's so fucking great when you accidentally find that you can skip from one song to the next in a perfectly matching up way
2022-03-16 19:50:20	nihilazo	huh apparently AUs are a thing
2022-03-16 19:50:28	dzwdz	...duh
2022-03-16 19:50:28	nihilazo	in fanfic of the expanse
2022-03-16 19:50:30	nihilazo	of course they are
2022-03-16 19:50:31	dzwdz	oh
2022-03-16 19:50:34	flowercorpse	on the topic of plants in britain, somehow none of my plants died yet, even though I forget to water them all the time

2022-03-16 19:54:21	nihilazo	well, 37 that are not rated explicit
2022-03-16 19:54:57	猫	there are 88 G rated aikatsu fics, probably helped by Aikatsu being a kid's show lol
2022-03-16 19:55:42	猫	and a lot a lot of OCs which is fair

2022-03-16 20:02:12	dzwdz	he just makes the story up
2022-03-16 20:02:20	opfez	it has the translated version right next to it, and it is pretty similar to norwegian

2022-03-16 20:04:04	opfez	bx: are you doing opengl on macos? i thought it was deprecated on there
2022-03-16 20:04:18	bx	It technically is
2022-03-16 20:04:24	bx	but you can still use it
2022-03-16 20:04:44	bx	and, like i dont really wanna learn metal
2022-03-16 20:04:52	opfez	aren't you on a linux machine?

2022-03-16 20:06:58	bx	for gur last couple years
2022-03-16 20:06:59	hegz	ayeee o/
2022-03-16 20:07:02	opfez	woah i didn't know
2022-03-16 20:07:02	bx	\o hegz
2022-03-16 20:07:07	bx	opfez: yeah i am
2022-03-16 20:07:50	opfez	hegz: favourite interest, favourite food, favourite band, go
2022-03-16 20:08:19	hegz	yess!
2022-03-16 20:08:45	bx	Those're good questions
2022-03-16 20:08:49	opfez	speed friend making style
2022-03-16 20:08:51	katie	i am in a meeting at work and i just watched a guy accidentally make all of the streetlights in a downtown centre strobe red for ten seconds because google maps didnt register his cursor position properly...
2022-03-16 20:09:10	astrinaut	terrifying, haha
2022-03-16 20:09:19	bx	katie: that's disturbing
2022-03-16 20:09:22	opfez	whatt
2022-03-16 20:09:39	astrinaut	i mean, at least they still have failsafe ckts in traffic control systems
2022-03-16 20:09:45	bx	wait, streetlights = lights for light, or lights for traffic?
2022-03-16 20:09:47	hegz	i love tinkering with low-level stuff, my fav food is apple pie and I don't really like a specific band :p
2022-03-16 20:10:05	bx	imma need more details on gur apple pie
2022-03-16 20:10:05	katie	ahah i should clarify, they are street illumination devices not traffic control systems
2022-03-16 20:10:11	astrinaut	there is hardware in there that sees conflicting greens and instantly goes into all-flashing-red lockout mode
2022-03-16 20:10:15	astrinaut	ohhh
2022-03-16 20:10:27	katie	still a little terrifying but not nearly as bad
2022-03-16 20:10:29	bx	katie: thats still disurbing but also kinda sounds moody in a good way
2022-03-16 20:10:48	hegz	i mean, who doesn't love apple pies :3
2022-03-16 20:10:56	bx	hegz: like is it a specific species of apple youre most into?
2022-03-16 20:10:58	opfez	hegz: those are good picks
2022-03-16 20:11:04	opfez	we can officially be friends
2022-03-16 20:11:23	 *	bx 's fave food is probs cherry pie
2022-03-16 20:11:40	 *	bx doesn't eat it often cause gur sugar makes his skin itchy
2022-03-16 20:12:21	katie	apple pie is s tier
2022-03-16 20:12:47	bx	Yea, even not that great apple pie can be pretty good (ie mcdonalds)
2022-03-16 20:13:14	hegz	bx: golden delicious's are my favs
2022-03-16 20:13:25	hegz	but ill gladly eat any apple pie
2022-03-16 20:13:34	bx	Valid
2022-03-16 20:14:05	bx	Granny smith is my fave just as an apple, havent tried enough apple pie to formulate an opionion on diff species
2022-03-16 20:15:06	hegz	opfez: nothing beats a friendship over apple pies
2022-03-16 20:15:54	bx	hegz, what's your username origin story? (i ask almost everyone this at some point)
2022-03-16 20:16:15	opfez	indeed
2022-03-16 20:16:32	hegz	I love cherry pie too, not as much as apple's but I see we are men of pie here
2022-03-16 20:17:22	nihilazo	I've not had a pie in ages
2022-03-16 20:17:28	 *	nihilazo needs to make some pie now
2022-03-16 20:17:54	flowercorpse	me neither but it just occured to me that I'm missing pie from my life
2022-03-16 20:17:58	bx	im still salty at me for forgetting pi day
2022-03-16 20:18:23	bx	someone please yell at me next year, so i dont miss it
2022-03-16 20:18:58	<--	katie (katie@localhost) has quit (connection closed)
2022-03-16 20:19:16	nihilazo	this has been the first pi day in a while where I wasn't a jerk to people about tau
2022-03-16 20:19:20	nihilazo	I consider that personal improvement
2022-03-16 20:19:36	asm	nice
2022-03-16 20:19:46	bx	do we have tau day as well?
2022-03-16 20:19:48	nihilazo	I still prefer tau but I used to be annoying about it
2022-03-16 20:19:57	nihilazo	because I used to be an annoying kid who thought they were smart
2022-03-16 20:19:58	asm	what is tau, though?
2022-03-16 20:20:00	hegz	bx: so my actual nickname that I use is hegzploit (I use hegz for short though), hegazy is my family name and I love exploits *hackerman* I just mixed and matched haha..
2022-03-16 20:20:06	nihilazo	we do have tau day
2022-03-16 20:20:14	nihilazo	asm: tau is 2 pi
2022-03-16 20:20:22	nihilazo	and a better circle constant, imo
2022-03-16 20:20:35	asm	interesting
2022-03-16 20:20:44	bx	hegz: Good origin story, hegazy is a cool name
2022-03-16 20:20:51	 *	asm places a circle of pies around you
2022-03-16 20:20:51	hegz	bx: I'm more intersted in knowing the story behind your name though
2022-03-16 20:21:21	nihilazo	https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto if you want to read about tau from the people who care about tau
2022-03-16 20:21:26	nihilazo	I don't any more because I'm not sad any more
2022-03-16 20:21:31	nihilazo	(at least not in that way)
2022-03-16 20:21:37	bx	"brandon x".split(" ").map(x => x[0]).join("")  ->  "bx"
2022-03-16 20:21:43	bx	(it's just my initials)
2022-03-16 20:22:09	bx	"For millennia, the circle has been considered the most perfect of shapes"
2022-03-16 20:22:11	bx	tf
2022-03-16 20:22:33	asm	fun fact: rot13(bx) is "ok"
2022-03-16 20:22:51	bx	im getting dejavu on that
2022-03-16 20:23:41	hegz	bx: welp, wasn't expecting that simple answer
2022-03-16 20:24:19	bx	nihilazo: this page seems pretentious
2022-03-16 20:24:26	nihilazo	oh, it really is
2022-03-16 20:24:30	bx	i dont see whats wrong with 2pi
2022-03-16 20:24:35	flowercorpse	nihilazo: I would adopt that but it's already ingrained in my mind that tau represents a time constant :(
2022-03-16 20:24:35	hegz	something irrelevant a bit but, does anyone know how I can change my .tmux.conf here :s
2022-03-16 20:24:41	nihilazo	the whole pi vs tau thing is a very pretentious math debate
2022-03-16 20:25:05	bx	hegz: hehe, im not sure anyone does
2022-03-16 20:25:12	bx	i think you can just edit it as normal
2022-03-16 20:25:33	hegz	flowercorpse: I can relate with that
2022-03-16 20:26:10	bx	wait...
2022-03-16 20:26:28	bx	hear me out here if tau = 2pi, then on tau day it's only logical i get to eat TWO PIES
2022-03-16 20:27:19	hegz	bx: oh that worked, stupid me
2022-03-16 20:27:36	flowercorpse	the hill I would die on though is that voltage is U and not V
2022-03-16 20:27:41	hegz	bx: so tau day is just an excuse to consume some pie?
2022-03-16 20:27:56	bx	Y e S
2022-03-16 20:28:12	bx	flowercorpse: why U?
2022-03-16 20:28:29	flowercorpse	because it's curvy and not pointy
2022-03-16 20:28:29	bx	V seems to be gur easist to remmeber :p
2022-03-16 20:28:43	flowercorpse	and also V is also unit of volts
2022-03-16 20:28:51	flowercorpse	writing V=5V just doesn't feel right
2022-03-16 20:29:03	bx	Hm
2022-03-16 20:29:07	flowercorpse	looks like an equation with no solution
2022-03-16 20:29:13	bx	what's wrong with it being pointy?
2022-03-16 20:29:29	bx	(honsetly i think we're running out of meaningful symbols)
2022-03-16 20:29:46	flowercorpse	I don't know, U feels softer
2022-03-16 20:30:18	flowercorpse	most of europe uses U
2022-03-16 20:30:23	bx	but electricity isnt soft
2022-03-16 20:31:02	flowercorpse	adapted from german Unterschied
2022-03-16 20:31:09	bx	huh, intresitng
2022-03-16 20:32:05	hegz	I mean, the greek alphabet is the perfect candidate
2022-03-16 20:32:26	bx	yea, i think we've used it up
2022-03-16 20:35:24	flowercorpse	oh another argument for U is that V also represents volume
2022-03-16 20:35:51	bx	hm
2022-03-16 20:35:56	bx	you got a point hter
2022-03-16 20:36:00	flowercorpse	maybe I should write one of those webpages
2022-03-16 20:36:03	flowercorpse	the U manifesto
2022-03-16 20:36:15	bx	why can we just wright volt
2022-03-16 20:36:18	bx	or voltage
2022-03-16 20:37:02	hegz	or just IR
2022-03-16 20:37:06	hegz	wait what
2022-03-16 20:40:34	juspib	i recommend everyone takes a cruise on the Danube in Budapest
2022-03-16 20:41:18	bx	why?
2022-03-16 20:44:10	piusbird	dozens, how do you wanna do this
2022-03-16 20:44:50	juspib	because i just remembered when i did that some years ago and can confirm it makes a very nice memory
2022-03-16 20:45:30	bx	intrsting\

2022-03-16 20:45:50	flowercorpse	juspib: do you live there?

2022-03-16 20:50:48	flowercorpse	juspib: I really like Budapest
2022-03-16 20:54:59	flowercorpse	mhj: looks really cyberpunk
2022-03-16 20:55:20	bx	didnt know devterm was riscv
2022-03-16 20:55:32	mhj	Well, they weren't
2022-03-16 20:55:39	mhj	This is totally new lol
2022-03-16 20:57:12	dzwdz	guess who's back
2022-03-16 20:57:51	asm	who?
2022-03-16 20:58:04	bx	you?
2022-03-16 20:58:07	dzwdz	yea
2022-03-16 20:58:09	m455	shady's back
2022-03-16 20:59:28	bx	hehe
2022-03-16 21:00:02	dzwdz	eh, i associate "guess who's back" with still dre more
2022-03-16 21:00:26	juspib	wow, risc-v in a consumer product - the price/performance ratio sadly still very far from optimal
2022-03-16 21:01:02	dzwdz	with arm breaking into laptops and this out there
2022-03-16 21:01:11	dzwdz	x86 should be sweating
2022-03-16 21:02:03	dzwdz	i'd love to play around with risc
2022-03-16 21:02:11	dzwdz	s/risc/&-v
2022-03-16 21:02:11	sedbot	<dzwdz> i'd love to play around with risc-v
2022-03-16 21:02:42	dzwdz	although i suppose i haven't even messed around with arm that much yet
2022-03-16 21:03:05	juspib	i recently learned amd has a license from arm
2022-03-16 21:03:12	dzwdz	armd
2022-03-16 21:03:17	bx	amdarm
2022-03-16 21:03:35	juspib	they haven't sold or announced any arm chip yet so i figure they're still doing some heavy arm work in their labs
2022-03-16 21:03:44	bx	lmao
2022-03-16 21:03:53	dzwdz	amdarm sounds like something that'll be installed by default on half the linux distros in a decade
2022-03-16 21:03:57	bx	Amd skipping leg day
2022-03-16 21:07:20	dzwdz	one of the characters in the fanfic i'm reading is worrying about a vampire who bit them wiping blood off their fangs with their hands being unsanitary
2022-03-16 21:07:27	dzwdz	like
2022-03-16 21:07:34	bx	lol
2022-03-16 21:07:36	dzwdz	imagine thinking /that/'s the unsanitary part
2022-03-16 21:07:46	bx	Do vamps brush?
2022-03-16 21:07:55	dzwdz	i hope so
2022-03-16 21:07:57	bx	also
2022-03-16 21:07:59	dzwdz	why wouldn't they?
2022-03-16 21:08:06	dzwdz	i'd imagine blood stains teeth
2022-03-16 21:08:09	bx	it's kinda wierd that their fangs *suck* blood
2022-03-16 21:08:16	bx	usually fangs inject
2022-03-16 21:08:19	dzwdz	they don't?
2022-03-16 21:08:26	bx	eh?
2022-03-16 21:08:30	dzwdz	they just suck like you'd suck on something
2022-03-16 21:08:34	dzwdz	fangs are there to pierce the skin
2022-03-16 21:08:37	bx	Oh
2022-03-16 21:08:47	bx	in that case i *really* hope they brush
2022-03-16 21:09:06	bx	Oh!
2022-03-16 21:09:13	flowercorpse	now I now things about vampire anatomy I didn't know before
2022-03-16 21:09:20	bx	maybe their fangs inject numbing agents and anit-coagulants!
2022-03-16 21:09:22	bx	like leaches
2022-03-16 21:09:27	dzwdz	that depends
2022-03-16 21:09:40	dzwdz	look at this point most of the vampire lore i know is from fanfics lel
2022-03-16 21:09:48	dzwdz	but in one i've read, the saliva acts as an anesthetic
2022-03-16 21:10:08	dzwdz	but often people write it as if there was no numbing at all
2022-03-16 21:10:09	juspib	my theory is that some brush and some don't, but the ones who don't later die cuz they can't pierce anyone's skin so the vast majority of alive vampires care well for their teeth
2022-03-16 21:10:21	dzwdz	ooo fun fact
2022-03-16 21:10:23	bx	that seems like it has more downsides, if they kiss someone theyre gonna numb them up
2022-03-16 21:10:40	dzwdz	do y'all know the reason why vampires can't see their reflections (well, kind of)?
2022-03-16 21:10:48	juspib	do you transfer saliva when kissing someone?
2022-03-16 21:10:54	dzwdz	you don't?
2022-03-16 21:10:59	bx	dzwdz: light bends around them?
2022-03-16 21:11:10	bx	juspib: people who're like using an open mouth do
2022-03-16 21:11:25	dzwdz	bx: so the reflection thing actually only applies to silver mirrors
2022-03-16 21:11:35	dzwdz	because they were the most popular ones back in the good ol vampire days
2022-03-16 21:11:40	bx	oooo
2022-03-16 21:11:50	dzwdz	and it was just because vampires can't interact with silver
2022-03-16 21:11:55	bx	OH
2022-03-16 21:12:02	dzwdz	which means they can see themselves in other kinds of mirrors
2022-03-16 21:12:10	bx	that's actually really intresting
2022-03-16 21:12:19	bx	so silver bullets hurt them too?
2022-03-16 21:12:24	dzwdz	duh
2022-03-16 21:13:37	bx	so hypothetically
2022-03-16 21:13:51	bx	if i wire a button to something using silver
2022-03-16 21:13:58	bx	gur vampire can't activate it
2022-03-16 21:14:04	dzwdz	yeah
2022-03-16 21:14:13	bx	Damm
2022-03-16 21:14:15	flowercorpse	bx: silver solder is actually popular
2022-03-16 21:14:20	bx	:O
2022-03-16 21:14:39	dzwdz	also the standard medicine used for burn wounds up until recently was silver sulfadiazine
2022-03-16 21:14:50	bx	til
2022-03-16 21:15:05	bx	ive only like proper burned myself once
2022-03-16 21:15:14	dzwdz	so that would also be an issue for vampires
2022-03-16 21:15:14	bx	well kinda twice
2022-03-16 21:15:23	dzwdz	i don't think i've ever truly burned myself
2022-03-16 21:15:27	bx	dzwdz: well dont they heal faster?
2022-03-16 21:15:34	dzwdz	yeah they do
2022-03-16 21:15:54	dzwdz	look i was hoping that the wikipedia page on medical uses of silver would have something more interesting than burn cream
2022-03-16 21:16:06	bx	I put my finger against stream of boiling water at work once, would not recommend
2022-03-16 21:16:10	dzwdz	oh damn, that message lines up super nicely in my terminal width
2022-03-16 21:16:14	dzwdz	bx: ow
2022-03-16 21:16:25	juspib	i think vampires are more vulnerable to fire
2022-03-16 21:16:31	flowercorpse	dzwdz: why do vampires have that accent
2022-03-16 21:16:46	bx	gur skin went like all saggy after, then i got a wierd blister, then it became a scabe
2022-03-16 21:16:49	bx	*scab
2022-03-16 21:16:55	bx	eventually it like fell off
2022-03-16 21:16:57	dzwdz	why do you have an accent
2022-03-16 21:17:09	bx	i dont
2022-03-16 21:17:13	dzwdz	juspib: yeah, thus vampires shouldn't ever listen to frank ocean
2022-03-16 21:17:16	dzwdz	it's so fire they'd die
2022-03-16 21:17:31	dzwdz	even i can barely survive
2022-03-16 21:17:45	flowercorpse	dzwdz: I'm not from the UK :(
2022-03-16 21:18:06	dzwdz	statistically, most vampires aren't either
2022-03-16 21:18:11	juspib	dzwdz: remember to play dj wielki chuj when entering an abandoned vampire mansion
2022-03-16 21:18:37	dzwdz	you're wrongly assuming that i'd want to keep the vampires away
2022-03-16 21:18:45	dzwdz	besides, i'm already hot as fire without it
2022-03-16 21:18:55	bx	what do you play to attract vampires?
2022-03-16 21:18:57	bx	a pipe organ?
2022-03-16 21:19:05	dzwdz	one of the castlevanias i guess
2022-03-16 21:19:18	dzwdz	i don't know what games vampires like
2022-03-16 21:19:19	@natalia	"software is hard" donald knuth
2022-03-16 21:19:31	juspib	ludo and chess
2022-03-16 21:19:39	dzwdz	ooo right
2022-03-16 21:19:43	dzwdz	chess is a vampire game
2022-03-16 21:19:43	@natalia	"if i had never thought about computer typesetting, i might have had a happier life in some ways" donald knuth
2022-03-16 21:19:45	nihilazo	ludo is an overrated game
2022-03-16 21:19:46	dzwdz	definitely
2022-03-16 21:19:49	dzwdz	natalia: lmao
2022-03-16 21:19:50	nihilazo	but chess is a good game

2022-03-16 21:20:07	dzwdz	chess is definitely a game that vampires would play a lot
2022-03-16 21:20:13	flowercorpse	juspib: polish is a really cool language
2022-03-16 21:20:19	dzwdz	nie

2022-03-16 21:20:32	juspib	of course it is
2022-03-16 21:20:55	nihilazo	chess is a vampire game for sure
2022-03-16 21:21:02	bx	natalia: i thought about it and decided on just doing pixel art fonts for gur rest of my life
2022-03-16 21:21:10	flowercorpse	is it true that everyday polish uses the diminutive for nouns?
2022-03-16 21:21:41	dzwdz	yea
2022-03-16 21:21:56	dzwdz	not like too often, but yeah

2022-03-16 22:16:43	dzwdz	:(
2022-03-16 22:16:48	tomasino	awww
2022-03-16 22:17:29	tomasino	what's new, folk?
2022-03-16 22:17:40	dzwdz	i'm not doing shit with my life
2022-03-16 22:17:49	@natalia	i am unfortunately finding myself needing to edit computer files
2022-03-16 22:18:09	dzwdz	oh no
2022-03-16 22:18:56	petra	which kind? /etc?
2022-03-16 22:19:48	@natalia	program listings and also latex documents
2022-03-16 22:20:19	tomasino	not stuff you want to be editing? that is too bad, indeed
2022-03-16 22:20:25	tomasino	i hope it's quick and you can get back to fun
2022-03-16 22:21:15	@natalia	it actually is fun
2022-03-16 22:21:35	tomasino	oh, well double-plus good then!
2022-03-16 22:21:55	@natalia	i am trying to work out the semantics of a text editor project
2022-03-16 22:22:26	tomasino	text-object definitions and parser logic?
2022-03-16 22:22:45	@natalia	no, it's a boring line editor :P
2022-03-16 22:23:41	tomasino	hah, your own personal ed?
2022-03-16 22:24:12	dzwdz	PErsonal ED
2022-03-16 22:24:24	@natalia	nooo
2022-03-16 22:24:44	@natalia	tomasino: it is a multi-head multi-buffer ed that tries to keep ed semantics where possible
2022-03-16 22:25:09	tomasino	that's a noble goal. would make an excellent braille editor
2022-03-16 22:25:54	@natalia	i have been enjoying prototyping over irc
2022-03-16 22:26:11	dzwdz	wait so the project is more than just an irc bot?
2022-03-16 22:26:28	@natalia	edward is the irc bot that does the barebones ed(1) wrapper
2022-03-16 22:27:09	@natalia	the finished project is named edwin
2022-03-16 22:27:14	@natalia	theres also e̷͇͌͆d̶̠̣̎̚M̷̫̄u̸̞̓̄ͅN̴͇̔͆D̵̙͚̓̃ whom we do not speak of
2022-03-16 22:27:20	dzwdz	isn't edwin already a thing?
2022-03-16 22:27:25	dzwdz	yoo, edMUnD
2022-03-16 22:27:37	tomasino	we don't talk about e̷͇d̶̠M̷̫u̸̞N̴͇D̵̙
2022-03-16 22:27:50	@natalia	ive never heard of edwin being a software thing
2022-03-16 22:28:26	dzwdz	it definitely rings a bell, but i can't find anything via a quick search
2022-03-16 22:28:46	dzwdz	maybe i just was using something with a similar name
2022-03-16 22:32:00	dzwdz	could've been part of a larger package software
2022-03-16 22:32:03	dzwdz	idk
2022-03-16 22:32:29	@natalia	from my understanding the name conflicts with the names of a bunch of dudes from Wikipedia
2022-03-16 22:32:39	dzwdz	oh no
2022-03-16 22:33:37	dzwdz	edm? ed improved?
2022-03-16 22:33:55	@natalia	i am not looking for names but also especially not if they arent names of like A Guy
2022-03-16 22:34:33	dzwdz	is there any unix utility named bob yet
2022-03-16 22:34:46	@natalia	(that start with ed)
2022-03-16 22:34:55	dzwdz	huh, doesn't seem like it
2022-03-16 22:37:08	dzwdz	bob would be a good name for something
2022-03-16 22:39:00	tomasino	like a person maybe... but he should be happy. Maybe give him a happy last name, like "joy". But then bob is three letters and so is joy, so maybe we tweak the bob into something similar, like "bill". There we go. Now our make-believe human can be the catalist for our new editor. I wonder what Bill Joy will make?

2022-03-17 07:19:15	agafnd	is... something starting, slowly memory leaking, getting OOM-killed, & restarted by a daemon?

2022-03-17 09:16:44	nihilazo	if I'm feeling so tired I am collapsing on my bedroom floor
2022-03-17 09:16:56	nihilazo	is that enough to count as being ill for the sake of taking time off school

2022-03-17 09:54:35	extratone	I definitely haven't.
2022-03-17 09:57:06	login	i thought age forced balance upon you using incentives and disincentives

2022-03-17 10:20:21	dzwdz	i'd rather have some russian do the opposite
2022-03-17 10:20:39	dzwdz	wipe the drives of all americans
2022-03-17 10:21:18	dzwdz	a supply chain war would be fun

2022-03-17 11:53:44	twee	what is a nation
2022-03-17 12:08:11	juspib	A nation is a community of people formed on the basis of a combination of shared features such as language, history, ethnicity, culture and/or territory.
2022-03-17 12:13:23	twee	thats incredibly vague
2022-03-17 12:13:36	twee	and i would say discounts both russia and america
2022-03-17 12:22:49	juspib	what do you mean
2022-03-17 12:58:59	flowercorpse	twee: most definitions are incredibly vague by nature
2022-03-17 12:59:54	flowercorpse	I would think
2022-03-17 13:28:33	twee	flowercorpse: for sure
2022-03-17 13:28:45	twee	which is why i think its awkward when they're so politicized
2022-03-17 13:28:56	twee	i wish android had central notification management
2022-03-17 13:29:15	twee	like to say what colour leds are, how to vibrate, whether to pop up, whether to turn the screen on

2022-03-17 17:32:05	juspib	hi extratone
2022-03-17 17:32:13	extratone	good morning 50
2022-03-17 17:40:10	dzwdz	a vi-like editor which doesn't take up the entire terminal would be nice
2022-03-17 17:40:16	dzwdz	for writing commit messages and stuff
2022-03-17 17:40:41	elly	what would be on the rest of the terminal?
2022-03-17 17:40:53	dzwdz	what was there before
2022-03-17 17:40:55	dzwdz	like
2022-03-17 17:41:06	dzwdz	it'd only take up the minimum vertical space needed
2022-03-17 17:41:15	twee	that sounds like magit/ed/launching vi in a new window would solve the problem easier
2022-03-17 17:41:23	dzwdz	if your commit message is 4 lines long, it would only occupy the bottom 4 lines
2022-03-17 17:41:26	dzwdz	there's no problem here
2022-03-17 17:41:54	dzwdz	i'm not trying to solve anything, i just think that'd be cool
2022-03-17 17:42:12	twee	what i think is cool is (global-visual-line-mode)
2022-03-17 17:42:16	twee	my contribution to gnu emacs
2022-03-17 17:42:25	dzwdz	what's that?
2022-03-17 17:42:38	elly	hmm, you could use screen's split mode I think
2022-03-17 17:42:41	twee	a mode that applies to all buffers, and wraps text if the lines are long
2022-03-17 17:42:42	elly	and have vi just occupy the bottom half
2022-03-17 17:42:49	dzwdz	that isn't as natural
2022-03-17 17:42:51	twee	kind of like what bbj does
2022-03-17 17:42:59	dzwdz	it wouldn't grow with the text file
2022-03-17 17:43:07	elly	"natural" is a function of what you expect
2022-03-17 17:43:13	elly	but yeah, it would be a fixed size
2022-03-17 17:43:20	dzwdz	do we have asciinema or something like that on town?
2022-03-17 17:43:23	dzwdz	i could just quickly show what i mean
2022-03-17 17:43:26	katie	you could probably write a vimscript to send the funky resize escape sequences to screen
2022-03-17 17:43:58	twee	hacky
2022-03-17 17:44:06	twee	what's wrong with just using another window
2022-03-17 17:44:07	dozens	shared tmux sesh?
2022-03-17 17:44:12	elly	hm, I wonder if that would work
2022-03-17 17:44:33	elly	twee: you could :) I don't think we are trying to solve a specific problem here so much as talking about an idea
2022-03-17 17:44:46	elly	curses apps do generally take over the whole terminal but there is no reason they particularly have to
2022-03-17 17:44:48	katie	i think it would work but it would be objectively lamer than just having vim grow on the terminals primary buffer
2022-03-17 17:45:23	dzwdz	i'm heavily inspired here by elly saying that she uses ed for commit messages
2022-03-17 17:45:36	elly	ed is great at that
2022-03-17 17:45:55	dzwdz	because it doesn't hide the rest of your terminal?
2022-03-17 17:46:11	m455	elly: doing a split mode with vi, this is literlaly how i write release notes at work: left vertical split with release notes .md file, right slit is two horizontal splits with the source code, and a checklist of all affected files for a release (except that i'm using tmux instead of screen)
2022-03-17 17:46:15	opfez	do you use ed with readline?
2022-03-17 17:46:18	dzwdz	so just imagine that but with proper editing capabilities
2022-03-17 17:46:18	elly	no
2022-03-17 17:46:24	elly	ed does have proper editing capabilities
2022-03-17 17:46:34	dzwdz	s/proper/visual
2022-03-17 17:46:34	sedbot	<dzwdz> so just imagine that but with visual editing capabilities
2022-03-17 17:46:41	opfez	oh, i've heard from some ed users it makes it far nicer to use
2022-03-17 17:46:54	elly	cannot comment, I've always used it sans readline
2022-03-17 17:47:00	dzwdz	natalia was complaining about rlwrap breaking... something in ed
2022-03-17 17:47:02	dzwdz	recently
2022-03-17 17:47:23	opfez	hmm odd
2022-03-17 17:47:28	dzwdz	so i'm super ignorant
2022-03-17 17:47:37	dzwdz	because i haven't used ed for much editing at all
2022-03-17 17:48:04	dzwdz	but in ed, if you want to edit a line, your two options are rewriting it from scratch and regex replace, right?
2022-03-17 17:48:09	elly	yes
2022-03-17 17:48:15	@natalia	i fixed this by using my irc's line input instead :triumph:
2022-03-17 17:48:20	elly	haha
2022-03-17 17:48:26	asm	hi town
2022-03-17 17:48:26	@natalia	ed is best used with a pad of paper next to you really for noting things you gotta fix later
2022-03-17 17:48:32	elly	lol
2022-03-17 17:48:38	opfez	geez
2022-03-17 17:48:41	opfez	hi asm o/
2022-03-17 17:48:49	dzwdz	that sounds more involved than just using vi
2022-03-17 17:48:53	opfez	^
2022-03-17 17:49:09	asm	I use ed, but the d is written and pronounced like macs
2022-03-17 17:49:15	elly	I was/am using ed because I like the aesthetic, not because it is the best editor
2022-03-17 17:49:27	opfez	asm: yes!
2022-03-17 17:49:34	dzwdz	asm, opfez: D:
2022-03-17 17:49:46	dzwdz	elly: fair
2022-03-17 17:49:49	asm	dzwdz: s/D:/:D/
2022-03-17 17:49:54	asm	you got the face wrong :p
2022-03-17 17:49:54	@natalia	ed is good because it's terrible and Secretly This Makes You A Better Programmer!*
2022-03-17 17:49:56	@natalia	*untrue
2022-03-17 17:50:03	elly	lol
2022-03-17 17:50:18	dzwdz	if writing code takes longer then you have more time to think about it!
2022-03-17 17:50:30	dzwdz	and other lies people make up to justify writing on paper
2022-03-17 17:50:40	elly	unfortunately, you expend all the thinking time you freed up in figuring out how best to manipulate ed itself
2022-03-17 17:51:10	opfez	it would be cool to see how a modern line editor would work
2022-03-17 17:51:16	@natalia	honestly it does get easier. i have been having a lot of fun
2022-03-17 17:51:18	opfez	i think the concept has some merit
2022-03-17 17:51:31	dzwdz	yeah that's what i've been saying for a long time
2022-03-17 17:51:34	dzwdz	limitation breeds creativity
2022-03-17 17:51:39	@natalia	my favorite ed feature is that the best commands are like, entirely line noise
2022-03-17 17:51:42	elly	I kind of don't tbh, visual editors have all the same capabilities but also more capabilities
2022-03-17 17:51:52	m455	ed sounds like the same reason i want to learn APL
2022-03-17 17:51:54	m455	hahaha
2022-03-17 17:52:01	elly	I have been using ed for years and years at this point and it has not produced "editing creativity" or similar
2022-03-17 17:52:03	opfez	dzwdz: mhm, i remember your LSP line editor idea
2022-03-17 17:52:13	dzwdz	elly: that's not what i mean
2022-03-17 17:52:26	dzwdz	i mean using a non-visual editor exclusively, and having it be easy to modify
2022-03-17 17:52:35	dzwdz	it'd be a pain, so you'd quickly come up with ways to extend it to make it easier to use
2022-03-17 17:52:51	@natalia	you could like patch on curses support
2022-03-17 17:52:51	elly	I think that most of those ways would be to turn it into a visual editor :P
2022-03-17 17:52:59	dzwdz	the point is to avoid that
2022-03-17 17:53:02	dzwdz	limitation breeds creativity
2022-03-17 17:53:15	dzwdz	those ways have already been explored
2022-03-17 17:53:18	twee	sometimes
2022-03-17 17:53:38	m455	in my cases, it has sometimes created frustration haha
2022-03-17 17:53:51	dzwdz	yeah like don't do that if you have important shit to do
2022-03-17 17:54:00	m455	haha yeah
2022-03-17 17:54:00	dzwdz	but if you'd be using it for a toy project? go for it
2022-03-17 17:54:22	elly	well, ed is small and pretty easy to modify
2022-03-17 17:54:26	elly	gnu ed is like 3000 lines total
2022-03-17 17:55:00	dzwdz	i don't think C programs count as pretty easy to modify
2022-03-17 17:55:02	@natalia	unironically the best ed feature would just be making a real undo stack
2022-03-17 17:55:07	@natalia	they are if you. know C?
2022-03-17 17:55:12	@natalia	and also the program is good
2022-03-17 17:55:24	elly	I find C pretty easy to modify
2022-03-17 17:55:30	elly	depends on the code a lot, but
2022-03-17 17:55:30	dzwdz	a good ruby program is going to be easier to modify than C anyways
2022-03-17 17:55:38	@natalia	ok then write it in ruby
2022-03-17 17:55:39	dzwdz	and there should be as little friction as possible
2022-03-17 17:55:46	elly	go for it :P
2022-03-17 17:55:55	elly	you could probably reimplement most of what ed does in a couple hundred lines of ruby
2022-03-17 17:56:00	dzwdz	i know
2022-03-17 17:56:27	@natalia	i am confused about what you are trying to get at
2022-03-17 17:56:38	opfez	dzwdz has already made ed in under 200 lines of C: https://github.com/dzwdz/pansy-fork/blob/main/src/bin/ed.c :)
2022-03-17 17:56:41	@natalia	anyway toy ed should be a multibuffer Lua quine that reloads itself
2022-03-17 17:56:45	dzwdz	that barely counts as an ed
2022-03-17 17:56:55	opfez	i used it to edit some files
2022-03-17 17:56:58	dzwdz	it uses a different syntax, barely works, and iirc isn't well coded at all
2022-03-17 17:57:34	dzwdz	yo ok
2022-03-17 17:57:39	dzwdz	an emacs-style extensible ed
2022-03-17 17:58:03	opfez	i was just thinking about it, make it lisp extensible and you basically have an extendible command line shell
2022-03-17 17:58:28	dzwdz	were you here when i suggested merging sh and ed into a single utility?
2022-03-17 17:58:31	opfez	editing files is cool and all, but sending ping requests from my lisp line editor is even cooler
2022-03-17 17:58:37	opfez	nope, you did?
2022-03-17 17:58:46	opfez	that sounds like what i'm thinking abou
2022-03-17 17:58:50	dzwdz	noone liked it lmao
2022-03-17 17:59:08	dzwdz	if you think about it, but not for too long, it kinda makes sense
2022-03-17 17:59:20	opfez	i mean, i think it would be super cool
2022-03-17 17:59:31	@natalia	the idea of making a good *command* editor interests me more than a "line editor" per se
2022-03-17 18:00:27	twee	programs as sql
2022-03-17 18:00:31	twee	use sql as editor
2022-03-17 18:00:49	@natalia	from my understanding ed is probably still worse than most gui editors for visually impaired people etc. but like, does it have to be? idk
2022-03-17 18:00:59	elly	hm
2022-03-17 18:01:08	elly	I would say that ed is not much worse with a screenreader than for sighted users
2022-03-17 18:01:10	@natalia	i suppose such a command editor would be a lot like a modern visual editor in semantics, except without any of the ui
2022-03-17 18:01:19	twee	theres edbrowse
2022-03-17 18:01:22	elly	that said, it isn't great for sighted users either :P
2022-03-17 18:01:25	@natalia	elly: yeah, it's not worse, it's just Bad
2022-03-17 18:01:35	twee	which is made by a visually impared dev for all their editing and browsing needs
2022-03-17 18:01:37	elly	accessibility via setting the bar very low1
2022-03-17 18:01:39	elly	!
2022-03-17 18:01:41	@natalia	lmao
2022-03-17 18:01:58	@natalia	posix comand `true` easily the most accessible
2022-03-17 18:02:07	@natalia	`yes` manages to fuck it up though
2022-03-17 18:09:54	@natalia	aghagh i have to Think about regular expression parsing
2022-03-17 18:10:10	@vilmibm	oh no
2022-03-17 18:10:13	@vilmibm	i had to do that in college
2022-03-17 18:10:27	@vilmibm	(assuming you mean parsing regex syntax)
2022-03-17 18:12:02	@natalia	yeah i mean i can do it i just Do Not Want To
2022-03-17 18:14:26	@natalia	wait okay posix actually has particularly odd behaviour about this
2022-03-17 18:15:25	@natalia	wait hold on what the *hell* are posix basic regular expressions
2022-03-17 18:15:33	@natalia	they do not support | but they support *backreferences*
2022-03-17 18:17:55	@natalia	and extended regular expressions support | et al *but not backreferences*
2022-03-17 18:18:26	@natalia	anyway gnu ed (and all bsd derived eds as far as i can tell, which gnu ed is ofc) do weird things for how they tell regular expressions end
2022-03-17 18:18:40	@natalia	the regular expression /[/]/ is one regex: the slash inside the brackets does not count(TM)
2022-03-17 18:19:07	@natalia	the regular expression /\(/\)/ is invalid--even though it would obviously not be correct for the regular expression to just end with an unbalanced bracket, it stops parsing there
2022-03-17 18:23:31	@natalia	posix leaves this sort of undefined so my implementation will not parse the regular expression to try to figure out what is ok
2022-03-17 18:24:01	twee	thats lovely
2022-03-17 18:42:25	bx	vilmibm: parsing regex syntax doesnt sound too bad
2022-03-17 18:42:37	dzwdz	hi bx
2022-03-17 18:42:42	@vilmibm	bx: depends on what you find fun
2022-03-17 18:42:45	bx	i wonder if there's like a slef hosting thing for regex
2022-03-17 18:42:46	@vilmibm	i mean i did it, it was fine
2022-03-17 18:42:52	@vilmibm	not something i would do recreationally though
2022-03-17 18:42:52	bx	dzwdz: yoooo
2022-03-17 18:43:09	bx	vilmibm: Ive developed a stockholm symdrome with writing parsers
2022-03-17 18:43:16	@vilmibm	hehe
2022-03-17 18:43:48	bx	partly thru hatred of parser generators
2022-03-17 18:44:24	bx	one day i shall write a simple easy to follow parser for some complex as language like C++
2022-03-17 18:44:46	bx	just to spite yacc/bison users
2022-03-17 18:45:22	bx	How're y'all doing ?
2022-03-17 18:45:24	elly	that would be fun to read
2022-03-17 18:45:29	dzwdz	i'm not doing SHIT still
2022-03-17 18:45:55	elly	I am on my work lunch break
2022-03-17 18:46:26	bx	are you eating lunch ?
2022-03-17 18:46:37	bx	dzwdz: Do you want to be doing shit?
2022-03-17 18:46:43	dzwdz	i don't know
2022-03-17 18:47:08	elly	bx: just did! vegetable pie
2022-03-17 18:47:15	dzwdz	i should very probably write about something
2022-03-17 18:47:20	dzwdz	like, anything
2022-03-17 18:47:34	elly	strong recommend! writing is fun
2022-03-17 18:47:47	dzwdz	if you're good at it
2022-03-17 18:48:08	bx	i should put my writing ideas in a text file
2022-03-17 18:48:11	elly	only one way to get good at it :P
2022-03-17 18:48:16	bx	maybe someone will write one
2022-03-17 18:48:19	dzwdz	why do you think i've said that i should write :p
2022-03-17 18:48:35	dzwdz	i'll either write some rant about node-ipc or some short vampire stories idk
2022-03-17 18:49:12	bx	Or you could help me decide where to shove gur sdfps repo
2022-03-17 18:50:26	@vilmibm	bx: i'm using ANTLR rn, does that fill you with hate
2022-03-17 18:51:34	elly	me sowing, writing my beautiful handwritten parser: haha fuck yeah! yes / me reaping, maintaining my parser as my language evolves: well this fucking sucks. what the fuck.
2022-03-17 18:51:45	bx	vilmibm: hate feels to strong
2022-03-17 18:52:17	@natalia	elly: me right now
2022-03-17 18:52:20	@natalia	i should have just imported lpeg...
2022-03-17 18:52:40	bx	though looking at antlr it doesnt seem as bad as yacc/bison
2022-03-17 18:53:23	@natalia	new theory: at any given time 50 percent of programmers are writing parser code
2022-03-17 18:54:48	bx	hmm
2022-03-17 18:55:15	bx	i mean, one of my proects is currently having its parser written
2022-03-17 18:57:38	@vilmibm	elly: hahahaha
2022-03-17 18:57:46	@vilmibm	i am not even trying. i'm fine with ANTLR.

2022-03-17 19:17:14	nihilazo	like cleaning my room
2022-03-17 19:17:32	nihilazo	I need to do the homework eventually but I have to write 6 pragraphs on this question and I can only think of 2
2022-03-17 19:17:41	nihilazo	one of which I know for sure will be marked as underdeveloped
2022-03-17 19:18:53	nihilazo	The British Constitution provides very weak protection for citizens rights.’ Analyse and evaluate this statement.
2022-03-17 19:19:13	nihilazo	I guess I'm meant to talk about all the different human rights laws? but they're all kinda shit
2022-03-17 19:19:14	bx	"we. dont. have. a. constitution."
2022-03-17 19:19:27	nihilazo	lol yeah
2022-03-17 19:19:31	nihilazo	that's what I want to write
2022-03-17 19:19:37	nihilazo	but you have to write about the constitution that doesn't really exist
2022-03-17 19:19:48	bx	o h  j o y
2022-03-17 19:20:40	nihilazo	I have 2 paragraphs
2022-03-17 19:20:49	nihilazo	which are about the fact the human rights act 1998 is uncodified
2022-03-17 19:20:55	nihilazo	I can't think of literally anything else to write about
2022-03-17 19:21:09	dzwdz	vampires
2022-03-17 19:21:20	bx	I feel that way about most of my bs assigenemnts
2022-03-17 19:22:20	nihilazo	I think this might be being formally assessed as well
2022-03-17 19:22:22	nihilazo	I can do it later
2022-03-17 19:22:28	 *	nihilazo will proceed to never do it probably
2022-03-17 19:23:04	dzwdz	if you're looking for an excuse to procrastinate i've got a good one
2022-03-17 19:23:22	dzwdz	rhymes with nest

2022-03-17 19:27:53	juspib	200iq pun
2022-03-17 19:27:56	dzwdz	so i got into a situation where i only had my king against two rooks
2022-03-17 19:28:07	dzwdz	instead of just like
2022-03-17 19:28:12	dzwdz	attempting a normal checkmate
2022-03-17 19:28:25	bx	Oh wait, i get it, check mating
2022-03-17 19:28:27	dzwdz	my opponent just went to promote to a queen
2022-03-17 19:28:37	bx	dzwdz: Nice?
2022-03-17 19:28:37	dzwdz	then also managed to lose their rook
2022-03-17 19:28:40	bx	Oh
2022-03-17 19:28:47	dzwdz	this whole time mate was about 4-5 moves away
2022-03-17 19:28:50	dzwdz	they took 20
2022-03-17 19:28:57	bx	λooooooool
2022-03-17 19:29:22	nihilazo	I have missed multiple mates in one
2022-03-17 19:29:31	nihilazo	in most games that I've played that have got to an endgame
2022-03-17 19:29:37	nihilazo	I am a very low rated player
2022-03-17 19:29:49	elly	nihilazo: definitely do your schoolwork
2022-03-17 19:29:56	dzwdz	so about my suggestion for procrastination
2022-03-17 19:30:02	dzwdz	which rhymes with a dress
2022-03-17 19:30:19	dzwdz	nonetheless
