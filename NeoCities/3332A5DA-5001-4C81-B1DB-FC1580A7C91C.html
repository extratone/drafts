<h2>Periscope‚Äôs successor is explicitly built to silence those who are unable to or uncomfortable with using their voice.</h2>

<p>Today, I came to a few revelations that led me to feel obligated to write about Twitter‚Äôs ‚Äúnew‚Äù live audio broadcasting feature, Spaces. Considering how much I read on a daily basis on media and the web, it‚Äôs quite pitiful that I would end up discovering their<a href=""></a> existence as the majority of eventual users will, the app relaunching lands on the Home tab, which now features the Instagram Stories-derived Fleets gallery as the top header. I‚Äôm not sure what this looks like for the average user, but for me, it is always stocked with blue-embossed circular profile pictures - all people I followed in the decade+ before I hit my limit., but often cannot recall when or why. Suffice it to say, it‚Äôs unlikely I would easily run out of Fleets to watch if I ever find myself in a stage of obsessive Fleet consumption. Spaces only came to my attention when I happened to spot a <em>purple</em> cluster of rounded profile pictures in this menu. Naturally, I tapped immediately, and found myself in a Space run by <a href="https://twitter.com/mygunisquick">Matt Daniels</a> and including <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeelgan">Mike Elgan</a> as speaker. You might notice, now, following those hyperlinks, that both have the Purple Circle emoji üü£ in front of their display names on their Profiles. They explained that it‚Äôs become a trend among those who‚Äôve been granted Spaces access to indicate that they are testing and <em>discussing</em> Spaces.</p>

<p>I was lucky to happen upon this particular Space - Matt was a fairly-prolific Periscope broadcaster, and that dearest app came up in the conversation just as I was approved as a speaker to mention it. I noted that I‚Äôd heard Spaces was built atop the technology Twitter acquired from Periscope in its acquisition and cited <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1260074702204293121">my recent observations</a> of my own experiences on that late service, asking whether or not Spaces would eventually meet a similar fate. I‚Äôd been suggesting that Periscope was the only entirely-positive social network experience I‚Äôd ever encountered, noting that I still wasn‚Äôt instinctively compelled to open the app nearly as much as I should have been, however. Matt‚Äôs response was quite profound: as a regular and popular Periscope broadcaster, his perspective was that its fundamental problem lied in insufficient filtering of its text chat. He said that Spaces‚Äô exclusion of that feature was an important component of its potential, along with the fundamental implications behind new guests being muted by default. I hadn‚Äôt yet figured out a method of recording Spaces (more on that in a bit,) so I would qualify my account of this conversation in a big way, but I vaguely recall Mike chiming in to relay a sentiment he‚Äôd heard from Twitter employees in another recent Space: they understood and explicitly intended to continue in the text chat-less direction because of feedback from Periscope creators like Matt.</p>

<p>For myself, the general praise of Spaces (and Clubhouse, adjacently) as a democratizing new social feature definitely resonates. In just that first experience, I was given the opportunity to speak directly to Matt and Mike - the later of whom I have been reading and listening to for my whole adult life. He even followed me after the Space ended. Yesterday, I happened upon a Space hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/benpopper?s=21">Ben Popper</a> - formerly one of my favorites on <em>The Verge</em>‚Äôs masthead - in which he was broadcasting <a href="https://whyp.it/t/ben-poppers-turkey-calls-46198">his impressively-disciplined turkey calls</a> from ‚Äúa shed in the woods.‚Äù He approved me as speaker immediately and was incredibly accommodating of my questions about his former colleagues and recent life events. (He‚Äôs now living ‚Äúrurally‚Äù and working as Director of Content at Stack Overflow - neither of which I would have ever expected.)</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZH-SHzE8XQ</p>

<p>Yet another former <em>Verge</em> staffer, <a href="https://twitter.com/samsheffer">Sam Scheffer</a>, has been the most active Spaces user on my Timeline. Notably, he is one of the only Twitter Tech Media folks I know who has continued to be honest with himself and the world about his feelings about the service. Among a crop of people who once exclaimed shit like ‚ÄúI <em>love</em> Twitter‚Äù and ‚ÄúI <em>live</em> on Twitter,‚Äù his singular continued use of such terms reflects something significant, I think. Understandably given Tump Hell, it is now very popular to lament Twitter whenever possible, even among those who‚Äôs volume of use has not changed in any measurable way. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reaching to say that Sam and I are alike in our desire to try out whatever we‚Äôre tossed the keys to in as extreme a degree as possible. I‚Äôve stopped by a handful of his Spaces - which are often also about Spaces, itself. Most recently however, he approved me to speak in a Space including a host of Silicon Valley folk and at least one Microsoft employee, talking about the future of AR and VR, vaguely in response to Microsoft‚Äôs Ignite event, which legitimately disturbed me.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1366804088629919744</p>

<p>I probably waited too long to speak up, until he was trying to wrap up the Space - but I did chime in about the way the Ignite keynote made me feel and attempted to convey the contrast between the goals of the tech industry and the general attitudes toward AR and VR present in the Midwesterners around me. Essentially, I was granted yet another unique <em>opportunity</em> to ask a question that‚Äôs been bothering me for years, now: <em>what the fuck are you doing and why???</em> It was the Microsoft Man (I can‚Äôt find his account, now, sorry) who responded very promptly, considering, with an explanation that actually made a lot of sense. The gist of it was <em>we are contending with the idea that we may never work in an office again, and these technologies offer a difficult-to-explain amends</em>. He specifically used the term ‚Äúfatigue‚Äù in describing his own experiences trying to collaborate remotely and reflected on the benefits of virtual context on the most elemental, sensory components of interaction throughout a workday. From that <sub>45</sub> second response, I feel as though I gained more understanding than I have from years of reading on my own, which further reinforces his observations, in retrospect.</p>

<p>~~[<a href="https://twitter.com/kalibration/status/1371021244762619904">Kali Tweet Embed</a>]~~ (Kali‚Äôs account is private right now.)</p>

<p>Already, it would seem Twitter Spaces might have a lot to offer David Blue, going forward. Though I signed up for Clubhouse‚Äôs waiting list last year (twice, in fact, but please don‚Äôt tell on me,) I have yet to hear back from them. If I was a bitter person, I would be up in arms about this, citing the fact that I would probably contribute more to the wellbeing of the project, technically, than 90% of those who‚Äôve been invited. (I am the physical manifestation of the <em>Stress Test</em>, and I spend an absurd amount of time on beta feedback, <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1362822335041048577">even on software <em>I‚Äôm fucking paying for</em></a>.) From what I originally heard, though, Clubhouse was showing real promise as a space where creators of color felt in control of their experience. I hope this has continued to be true and - if it has - I say <em>never</em> invite me.</p>

<h2>The Social and The Socialites</h2>

<p>Crucially, though, enabling <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1370838780333146118">my tech bro ass</a> to engage with famous tech bros about tech bro shit is never going to justifiably occupy anyone‚Äôs list of priorities in my lifetime (including my own.) The original promise of the internet did not include amplification of voices already/otherwise at max volume. Instead, it was using technology to deliver new, varying, and universally-empowering tools of expression to those who‚Äôd been minimized for all of human history. It didn‚Äôt have to be philanthropic - in fact, it was and shall always remain in the best interest of the loudest folks to hear from the other side of the spectrum. The possibilities of this dynamic should be <em>thrilling</em> to all involved, and it used to be for Twitter, Inc. Or so it seemed, anyway. As the company has honed its various loglines over the years, their actions have reflected their truth less and less.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the most visible co-founder of Periscope, <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz">Kayvon Beykpour</a>, is now Twitter‚Äôs Head of Consumer product, and he spent this past week doing interviews about Twitter‚Äôs late feature frenzy. I want to share two very different podcast episodes with two very different interviewers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder">Nilay Patel‚Äôs <em>Decoder</em> interview</a> should probably be first priority as the more comprehensive and digestible of the two.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We started it from the standpoint of ‚Äúwhy are people not tweeting?‚Äù It turns out that some of the reasons they‚Äôre not tweeting is they don‚Äôt feel safe. They don‚Äôt feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they‚Äôre such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we‚Äôve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you‚Äôre just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‚ÄúWhy are people not tweeting‚Äù justifies us taking a moment to indulge some hilarity: imagine Jack and his hellbeard wandering around the abandoned Twitter office screaming that question at the walls, over and over again. Bekypour‚Äôs decision to identify one‚Äôs ‚Äúon the public record‚Äù Tweets as ‚Äúterrifying‚Äù could easily be tossed back at the company in the center of a dense globule of shit, but one imagines it‚Äôd hardly be constructive. I‚Äôm going to take my furthest leap here and suggest that we examine who exactly Kayvon was considering - those who find on Twitter a ‚Äúpopularity context of likes and retweets and impressions,‚Äù and feel ‚Äúintimidated‚Äù by it. Those I‚Äôve known on Twitter who‚Äôve had negative experiences or have otherwise felt the need to take greater control of a given moment‚Äôs interactions generally make use of the ‚ÄúProtect My Tweets‚Äù selection in their account‚Äôs privacy settings. (This is called ‚Äúprivate Twitter,‚Äù in case you‚Äôre unfamiliar.) This was clearly on the minds of whoever crafted <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">the official Twitter Support page on Spaces</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people‚Äôs Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this and come to the conclusion that Kayvon was speaking of a relative minority of Twitter users in his explanation, consciously or not. It‚Äôs telling that I was unable to find the statistics of an average Twitter account‚Äôs number of daily interactions, but it also means I have to make yet another supposition: even most <em>regular</em> Twitter users rarely experience an overwhelming amount of what I‚Äôll call account-specific notifications (mentions, replies, likes, and retweets, as distinct from algorithmically-sourced content recommendations.) I could be wrong, but I would argue that only the most popular Twitter users - those most visible by way of all sorts of celebredom - are under pressure to consider ‚Äúthe public record.‚Äù When Kayvon explains Twitter‚Äôs interest in making Spaces ephemeral, he is speaking for the ‚Äúclients‚Äù who make Twitter a (debatably) viable <strong>business</strong>. This should not be surprising or damning, necessarily, but only so long as it is emphasized.</p>

<p>Early in the interview, Nilay ‚Äúreframes‚Äù the pillars of Twitter‚Äôs current development as described by Bekypour. ‚ÄúHealth,‚Äù he observes, ‚Äúis basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.‚Äù A large, most uncomfortable component of this ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù is just another manifestation of the age-old dynamic between celebrities and everyone else. The tools Twitter is building along this line are designed to enable the social upper class (if you will) to better manage their interactions with the masses. Abstractly, Twitter sounds like an inherently democratizing space as described to an unfamiliar party. The personal experiences with Spaces I outlined were undoubtedly democratizing <em>for me</em>, but the essence of this new direction Twitter has taken - led by the co-mastermind of what I would call the most democratized social platform of our time - is an explicit, clearer-than-ever commitment to amplify the already/otherwise amplified voices which belt the song of popular relevancy.</p>

<h2>Scope History in Scope</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec">other important Bekypour interview</a> comes via Alex Kantrowitz‚Äôs <em>Big Technology Podcast</em>, who is notably much less Vox media glossy than Nilay in his questions. When he asks why Spaces ended up looking so similar to Clubhouse, Bekypour responds with an revealing anecdote on Periscope‚Äôs story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, we‚Äôve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it‚Äôs funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, it was under Twitter‚Äôs tenure that Periscope <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/twitter-launches-audio-only-broadcasting-feature-on-its-ios-app-and-periscope/">first added audio-only broadcasting</a> in September 2018, followed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/periscopes-latest-feature-turns-your-broadcast-into-a-radio-talk-show/">audio-only guest call-ins</a> in February of the next year. My occasional check-ins with the community and brief skim of the iOS app‚Äôs release notes suggest that Periscope‚Äôs technical development staff were then quickly diverted to other projects, fired, or killed. The language in the service‚Äôs self-published Medium obituary is aggravatingly avoidant of any responsibility for the state of disrepair Periscope has subsequently found itself in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>We have no idea how this happened! What a tragedy! Our sympathies.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the past couple of years, we‚Äôve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn‚Äôt doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read: News networks don‚Äôt bother to simulcast to Periscope anymore and we can‚Äôt remember the last time any sort of celebrity said something controversial enough on our platform to get pscp.tv in the news. ‚ÄúNobody at the wheel‚Äù has been my recent favorite idiom to staple on software/services that have remained ‚Äúon the market,‚Äù so to speak - still taking money/account signups/other contemporary manifestations of currency exchange, and yet <em>appear</em> abandoned under varying degrees of scrutiny. (Clyp.it is the most <a href="https://bit.ly/enduserwhyp">recently relevant</a> example I‚Äôve investigated.) I should disclaim that I have no idea what it‚Äôs like to work for a software company - my only <em>real</em> technology employment was for a small-time IT company. I should also disclose that my intentional exploration of the open source/open web/decentralized community since early 2018 has definitely incubated a few biases toward the abstract idealism present in their preferred methodologies. What I‚Äôm really saying: I find the whole spectrum of secrecy purveyed and practiced in the realm of proprietary software <em>utterly absurd</em>. The fact that I and others on the beat must <em>speculate</em> if we‚Äôre to discuss the history of a given app‚Äôs development in any detail is ridiculous for many reasons which are inappropriate to dive into, here.</p>

</figure>

<p>A relevant, real-world example of the sort of silly mysteriousness this attitude manifests is the process by which I gained ‚Äúearly‚Äù access to Twitter Spaces on my main account, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel">@NeoYokel</a>, over the course of this writing. I noticed it‚Äôd been enabled almost exactly 24 hours after the timestamp on the DM (screenshotted above) I sent <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces">@TwitterSpaces</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/dieselgoth">@dieselgoth</a> - an alt I created last year mostly to spare my longtime followers from live racing Tweet spam which was granted Spaces access first, despite having been almost 100% dormant for months. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be unreasonable to assume my main account was explicitly/manually given access by a Twitter employee as a direct result of that message, but I‚Äôll never know for sure because it has yet to receive any response. As I <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374639645833711616">Tweeted</a>, I am far from personally up in arms because Twitter, Incorporated decided to <em>leave me on read</em>, but my young imagination conjures a million scenarios involving different sorts of people in which such a lack of acknowledgement certainly <em>would</em> be quite a deal, justifiably or not. All I‚Äôd ask is <em>for what reason, exactly</em>?</p>

<p>The most essential acknowledgement I must make, though, is that the two Spaces I‚Äôve started since gaining access received absolutely zero engagement, despite the latter being timed and labeled as optimally as I could personally manage <em>and</em> left open for more than an hour. This is in stark contrast to my early experiences on Periscope, especially, which were the heavyweights contributing to the sum of interactions throughout the history of my account, there. Of further note for context: <strong>I garnered a more voluminous, active ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù on Periscope than I have on any other social media service</strong> throughout the history of my internet presence. I felt it important to spell this out in the hope that this post would not become (or be regarded as) rudimentary bitching about how this story effects <em>me</em>, because it technically does - in a very specific, crucial manner - more than any other subject discussed in <em>The Psalms</em>. (If it comes across that way, or if you have any other thoughts to share, I would love nothing more than to ‚Äú<a href="https://bit.ly/dbrolodex">hear</a>‚Äù them and optionally add them to this post.) I would hope my work has come across as <em>unnecessarily</em> (perhaps even <em>aggravatingly</em>) transparent, this far, but it‚Äôs especially essential in this case. As I continue to cite my experiences on my Periscope/Twitter account(s,) I would also like to emphasize that I do so because 1) I don‚Äôt want to speak for anyone else and 2) I have access/control to their full documentation as well as my own permission to share it as needed, <strong>not</strong> because I think (or would argue) that my experience on Twitter properties, going forward, should be served or optimized for in any way. I haven‚Äôt already invested two weeks in this subject at this point for the sake of improving my own online life, but to speak for those uncomfortable with revealing their voice (regarding text chat omission in Spaces,) and to critically reflect on what Spaces‚Äô lack of discoverability (in contrast with Periscope, particularly) might mean for all Twitter users.</p>

<p>While we‚Äôre this deep in the meta, let me also confess to you that I had long intended to write a thorough celebratory essay detailing my positive experiences on Periscope, but put it off too long. I‚Äôve decided that this post shall have to take its place, so I‚Äôm therefore going to share the unedited draft of that essay from ::???:: in its entirety, now, marked by horizontal lines:</p>

<h1>A Good Place: Periscope Magic</h1>

<figcaption>The Magic of Periscope</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>One livestreaming app has always been a fascinating, generally positive, and all around beautiful place.</h2>

<p>In April, <em>The Outline</em> - one of my favorite Web Sites ever - <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/">closed its virtual doors</a>. I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called &#8220;<a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8423/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website">A Good Place</a>,&#8221; which began with the tag &#8220;the internet is too much, but this place is just right.&#8221; In general, it sought the more wholesome, &#8220;positive&#8221; bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet <em>mainstream</em> for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3">Twitter bought before its independent launch</a> that&#8217;s quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1069117482647076865</p>

<p>Through this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I&#8217;ve spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn&#8217;t understand each other whatsoever. I&#8217;ve streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance. Periscope is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">embedded more deeply in society</a> than one would think, considering how little it&#8217;s mentioned in media.</p>

<p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=0_0MynsbpOo</p>

<p>In February 2014, <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz">Kayvon Beykpour</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/joebernstein">Joe Bernstein</a> founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors &#8220;including Adobe executive Scott Belsky.&#8221; A year later, Twitter <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3">bought it for some $50&#8211;100 million</a> (not even <em>Business Insider</em> knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">Meerkat</a> - the since-extinct <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/the-inevitable-democratization/">arguably originating</a> service in the space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By building a <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/">dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter</a>‚Äòs interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that ‚Äújust works.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37555100">died</a> at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. &#8220;The <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw">surprise emergence of Meerkat</a> as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them,&#8221; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat">reported Casey Newton for <em>The Verge</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks ‚Äî which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.</p>

<p>Periscope, by contrast, maintains an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/9/11635382/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji">archive of past broadcasts</a> for a significant period and allows users to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/save-broadcast">save broadcasts locally</a> on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. <a href="https://qz.com/365293/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding/">Dan Frommer in <em>Quartz</em></a>:</p>

<p>What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks‚Äîwhere LTE service is available, at least‚Äîcan now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.</p>

<p>In 2015&#8211;2016, I worked afternoons (3&#8211;11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I&#8217;d sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Jquinta">Juanita</a> and <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Nicole3">Nicole</a> were made. <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/OMFGAshers">Ashers</a> bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)</p>

<h3>Preservation</h3>

<p>Yes, that‚Äôs where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Perhaps one day - assuming Twitter‚Äôs going to <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374680479874568194">stick to its word</a> and maintain an indefinite archive of all currently-viewable broadcasts - I will be able to justify investing further time in digging out more of my favorite scopes from others, but for now, I have begun <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1374664072654958594">a Twitter List</a> specifically for mutuals I met on Periscope, but it‚Äôs limited to those who have a <em>public</em> Twitter profile linked to the Periscope account I know them from. I also (sortof accidentally) uploaded the 43 video files of my own broadcasts I had in my possession (obtained with tools like Scopedown) to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiI5-v1HgmCbWg_Pu-Mp0s1LTBBoVAI7A">a playlist</a> on <em>Extratone</em>‚Äôs YouTube channel, not intending that they clog up the feed as they did.</p>

<h2>The Magic Left Out</h2>

<p>Yes, that‚Äôs where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Given just the exchanges I‚Äôve had about Periscope in the past week, I suspect I would find writing its full history in non-fiction narrative form to be an incredible, desperately unique experience, just as the app has. As I write, the mobile app, itself, has five and half days left to live (before it‚Äôs removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple‚Äôs App Store.) Early yesterday morning, as I opened the app to my feed, I was unable to find any recent or currently-live broadcasts which made any mention of this reality, despite spirited scrolling. The same uncanny noise of Periscope‚Äôs trademark, infinitely-wide spectrum of use continued beneath the banner embedded above, which was only <em>very</em> recently updated with The End‚Äôs specific date. It doesn‚Äôt really agitate my own personal urgency, either (if you cared to know,) because I‚Äôve endured the luxury of existence from a perspective of such thorough latency with reality for so long that I have all but forgotten the experience of actually expecting to finish anything on time.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>I‚Äôve even managed to exhaust the stage where I found my own slow pace entertaining, which is a definite first. It‚Äôs not even funny how long it takes me to do <em>anythihng</em> anymore, it‚Äôs just a fact.** <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to body" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
