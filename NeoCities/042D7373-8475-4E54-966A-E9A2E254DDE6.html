<p>NAME
 curl - transfer a URL</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS
 curl [options / URLs]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION
 curl is a tool for transfering data from or to a server. It supports
 these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS,
 IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP,
 SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET or TFTP. The command is designed
 to work without user interaction.</p>

<pre><code>   curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-
   tication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file  trans-
   fer resume and more. As you will see below, the number of features will
   make your head spin!

   curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See
   libcurl(3) for details.
</code></pre>

<p>URL
 The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You&#8217;ll find a detailed descrip-
 tion in RFC 3986.</p>

<pre><code>   You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets
   within braces and quoting the URL as in:

     &quot;http://site.{one,two,three}.com&quot;

   or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

     &quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt&quot;

     &quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt&quot;    (with leading zeros)

     &quot;ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt&quot;

   Nested  sequences  are not supported, but you can use several ones next
   to each other:

     &quot;http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html&quot;

   You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line.  They  will  be
   fetched  in a sequential manner in the specified order. You can specify
   command line options and URLs mixed and in any  order  on  the  command
   line.

   You  can  specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number
   or letter:

     &quot;http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt&quot;

     &quot;http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt&quot;

   When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt,
   you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the
   shell from interfering with it. This also  goes  for  other  characters
   treated special, like for example '&amp;', '?' and '*'.

   Provide  the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage sign
   and the interface name. Like in

     &quot;http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/&quot;

   If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix,  curl  will  attempt  to
   guess  what  protocol  you might want. It will then default to HTTP but
   try other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes.  For  exam-
   ple,  for  host names starting with &quot;ftp.&quot; curl will assume you want to
   speak FTP.

   curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL.  It  is  not
   trying  to  validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but
   is instead very liberal with what it accepts.

   curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file transfers, so
   that  getting many files from the same server will not do multiple con-
   nects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only done on
   files  specified  on  a  single command line and cannot be used between
   separate curl invocations.
</code></pre>

<p>OUTPUT
 If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It can
 be instructed to instead save that data into a local file, using the
 -o, &#8211;output or -O, &#8211;remote-name options. If curl is given multiple
 URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple op-
 tions for where to save them.</p>

<pre><code>   curl does not parse or otherwise &quot;understand&quot; the content  it  gets  or
   writes  as  output.  It does no encoding or decoding, unless explicitly
   asked to with dedicated command line options.
</code></pre>

<p>PROTOCOLS
 curl supports numerous protocols, or put in URL terms: schemes. Your
 particular build may not support them all.</p>

<pre><code>   DICT   Lets you lookup words using online dictionaries.

   FILE   Read  or  write  local  files.  curl  does not support accessing
          file:// URL remotely, but when running on Microsoft Windows  us-
          ing the native UNC approach will work.

   FTP(S) curl  supports  the  File Transfer Protocol with a lot of tweaks
          and levers. With or without using TLS.

   GOPHER(S)
          Retrieve files.

   HTTP(S)
          curl supports HTTP with numerous options and variations. It  can
          speak HTTP version 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2 and 3 depending on build op-
          tions and the correct command line options.

   IMAP(S)
          Using the mail reading protocol, curl can &quot;download&quot; emails  for
          you. With or without using TLS.

   LDAP(S)
          curl can do directory lookups for you, with or without TLS.

   MQTT   curl supports MQTT version 3. Downloading over MQTT equals &quot;sub-
          scribe&quot; to a topic while uploading/posting equals &quot;publish&quot; on a
          topic. MQTT over TLS is not supported (yet).

   POP3(S)
          Downloading  from  a  pop3  server means getting a mail. With or
          without using TLS.

   RTMP(S)
          The Realtime Messaging Protocol  is  primarily  used  to  server
          streaming media and curl can download it.

   RTSP   curl supports RTSP 1.0 downloads.

   SCP    curl supports SSH version 2 scp transfers.

   SFTP   curl supports SFTP (draft 5) done over SSH version 2.

   SMB(S) curl supports SMB version 1 for upload and download.

   SMTP(S)
          Uploading  contents  to  an  SMTP server means sending an email.
          With or without TLS.

   TELNET Telling curl to fetch a telnet URL starts an interactive session
          where  it  sends  what  it  reads  on stdin and outputs what the
          server sends it.

   TFTP   curl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.
</code></pre>

<p>PROGRESS METER
 curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating
 the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time
 left, etc. The progress meter displays number of bytes and the speeds
 are in bytes per second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based.
 For example 1k is 1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.</p>

<pre><code>   curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so  if  you  invoke
   curl  to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,
   it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
   mixing progress meter and response data.

   If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
   redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect  (&gt;),  -o,
   --output or similar.

   This  does  not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit out
   any response data to the terminal.

   If you prefer a progress  &quot;bar&quot;  instead  of  the  regular  meter,  -#,
   --progress-bar  is your friend. You can also disable the progress meter
   completely with the -s, --silent option.
</code></pre>

<p>OPTIONS
 Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an
 additional value next to them.</p>

<pre><code>   The  short  &quot;single-dash&quot;  form  of the options, -d for example, may be
   used with or without a space between it and its value, although a space
   is a recommended separator. The long &quot;double-dash&quot; form, -d, --data for
   example, requires a space between it and its value.

   Short version options that don't need any additional values can be used
   immediately  next  to  each other, like for example you can specify all
   the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.

   In general, all boolean options are enabled with --option and yet again
   disabled  with --no-option. That is, you use the exact same option name
   but prefix it with &quot;no-&quot;. However, in this list we mostly only list and
   show  the --option version of them. (This concept with --no options was
   added in 7.19.0. Previously most options were  toggled  on/off  through
   repeated use of the same command line option.)

   --abstract-unix-socket &lt;path&gt;
          (HTTP)  Connect  through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead
          of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the path  of  an  ab-
          stract  socket  prefixed  with  '@', however the &lt;path&gt; argument
          should not have this leading character.

          Example:
           curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpath https://example.com

          Added in 7.53.0.

   --alt-svc &lt;file name&gt;
          (HTTPS) This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl.  If  the
          file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be
          used. After a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the
          file name again if it has been modified.

          Specify a &quot;&quot; file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
          make curl just handle the cache in memory.

          If this option is used several times, curl  will  load  contents
          from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

          Example:
           curl --alt-svc svc.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.64.1.

   --anyauth
          (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself,
          and use the most secure one the remote site claims  to  support.
          This is done by first doing a request and checking the response-
          headers, thus possibly inducing  an  extra  network  round-trip.
          This  is  used  instead  of  setting  a  specific authentication
          method, which you can do with  --basic,  --digest,  --ntlm,  and
          --negotiate.

          Using --anyauth is not recommended if you do uploads from stdin,
          since it may require data to be sent twice and then  the  client
          must  be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading
          from stdin, the upload operation will fail.

          Used together with -u, --user.

          Example:
           curl --anyauth --user me:pwd https://example.com

          See also --proxy-anyauth, --basic and --digest.

   -a, --append
          (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the
          target  file  instead  of  overwriting  it.  If  the remote file
          doesn't exist, it will be created.  Note that this flag  is  ig-
          nored by some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH).

          Example:
           curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/

   --aws-sigv4 &lt;provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]&gt;
          Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the transfer.

          The  provider argument is a string that is used by the algorithm
          when creating outgoing authentication headers.

          The region argument is a string that points to a geographic area
          of  a resources collection (region-code) when the region name is
          omitted from the endpoint.

          The service argument is a string that points to a function  pro-
          vided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name is omitted
          from the endpoint.

          Example:
           curl --aws-sigv4 &quot;aws:amz:east-2:es&quot; --user &quot;key:secret&quot; https://example.com

          Added in 7.75.0.

   --basic
          (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the  re-
          mote host. This is the default and this option is usually point-
          less, unless you use it to override a previously set option that
          sets  a  different  authentication method (such as --ntlm, --di-
          gest, or --negotiate).

          Used together with -u, --user.

          Example:
           curl -u name:password --basic https://example.com

          See also --proxy-basic.

   --cacert &lt;file&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify
          the  peer.  The  file  may contain multiple CA certificates. The
          certificate(s) must be in PEM format. Normally curl is built  to
          use a default file for this, so this option is typically used to
          alter that default file.

          curl recognizes the environment variable named  'CURL_CA_BUNDLE'
          if  it  is  set,  and uses the given path as a path to a CA cert
          bundle. This option overrides that variable.

          The windows version of curl will automatically  look  for  a  CA
          certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same direc-
          tory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
          folder along your PATH.

          If  curl  is  built  against  the  NSS  SSL library, the NSS PEM
          PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this op-
          tion to work properly.

          (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
          then this option is supported for  backward  compatibility  with
          other  SSL  engines,  but it should not be set. If the option is
          not set, then curl will use the certificates in the  system  and
          user  Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred method
          of verifying the peer's certificate chain.

          (Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows
          7  or later with libcurl 7.60 or later. This option is supported
          for backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is
          recommended  to use Windows' store of root certificates (the de-
          fault for Schannel).

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cacert CA-file.txt https://example.com

   --capath &lt;dir&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate  directory  to
          verify  the  peer.  Multiple paths can be provided by separating
          them with &quot;:&quot; (e.g.  &quot;path1:path2:path3&quot;). The certificates must
          be  in PEM format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the di-
          rectory must have been processed using the c_rehash utility sup-
          plied  with  OpenSSL.  Using  --capath can allow OpenSSL-powered
          curl to make SSL-connections much more  efficiently  than  using
          --cacert if the --cacert file contains many CA certificates.

          If this option is set, the default capath value will be ignored,
          and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --capath /local/directory https://example.com

   --cert-status
          (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server  certificate
          by using the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS
          extension.

          If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid  (e.g.
          expired) response, if the response suggests that the server cer-
          tificate has been revoked, or no response at  all  is  received,
          the verification fails.

          This  is  currently  only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and
          NSS backends.

          Example:
           curl --cert-status https://example.com

          Added in 7.41.0.

   --cert-type &lt;type&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl what type the provided  client  certificate  is
          using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.  If not spec-
          ified, PEM is assumed.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cert-type PEM --cert file https://example.com

          See also -E, --cert, --key and --key-type.

   -E, --cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified  client  certificate  file
          when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based proto-
          col. The certificate must be in PKCS#12 format if  using  Secure
          Transport,  or PEM format if using any other engine.  If the op-
          tional password isn't specified, it will be queried for  on  the
          terminal.  Note  that  this  option assumes a &quot;certificate&quot; file
          that is the private key and the client certificate concatenated!
          See -E, --cert and --key to specify them independently.

          If  curl  is  built against the NSS SSL library then this option
          can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within  the
          NSS  database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by
          default /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS  PEM  PKCS#11  module  (lib-
          nsspem.so)  is  available  then  PEM files may be loaded. If you
          want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it
          with  &quot;./&quot;  prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.
          If the nickname contains &quot;:&quot;, it needs to be preceded by &quot;\&quot;  so
          that  it  is not recognized as password delimiter.  If the nick-
          name contains &quot;\&quot;, it needs to be escaped as &quot;\\&quot; so that it  is
          not recognized as an escape character.

          If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
          is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
          ify  a  certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
          ning with &quot;pkcs11:&quot; will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
          PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
          &quot;pkcs11&quot; if none was provided and the --cert-type option will be
          set as &quot;ENG&quot; if none was provided.

          (iOS  and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,
          then the certificate string can either be the name of a certifi-
          cate/private  key in the system or user keychain, or the path to
          a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If  you  want  to
          use  a  file  from the current directory, please precede it with
          &quot;./&quot; prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

          (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a  path
          expression  to  a  certificate  store.  (Loading PFX is not sup-
          ported; you can import it to a store first). You can use &quot;&lt;store
          location&gt;\&lt;store  name&gt;\&lt;thumbprint&gt;&quot;  to refer to a certificate
          in  the  system  certificates  store,  for   example,   &quot;Curren-
          tUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a&quot;.   Thumbprint
          is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see  in  certificate
          details.  Following  store locations are supported: CurrentUser,
          LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services,  CurrentUserGroupPolicy,
          LocalMachineGroupPolicy, LocalMachineEnterprise.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com

          See also --cert-type, --key and --key-type.

   --ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;
          (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list
          of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read  up  on  SSL  cipher
          list details on this URL:

           https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 https://example.com

   --compressed-ssh
          (SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a request,
          not an order; the server may or may not do it.

          Example:
           curl --compressed-ssh sftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.56.0.

   --compressed
          (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms
          curl supports, and automatically decompress the content. Headers
          are not modified.

          If this option is used and the server sends an  unsupported  en-
          coding, curl will report an error. This is a request, not an or-
          der; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.

          Example:
           curl --compressed https://example.com

   -K, --config &lt;file&gt;

          Specify a text file to read curl  arguments  from.  The  command
          line  arguments  found  in the text file will be used as if they
          were provided on the command line.

          Options and their parameters must be specified on the same  line
          in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.
          Long option names can optionally be given  in  the  config  file
          without the initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals
          characters can be used as separators. If the option is specified
          with  one or two dashes, there can be no colon or equals charac-
          ter between the option and its parameter.

          If the parameter contains whitespace (or starts with  :  or  =),
          the  parameter  must  be  enclosed  within quotes. Within double
          quotes, the following escape sequences are  available:  \\,  \&quot;,
          \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash preceding any other letter is ig-
          nored.

          If the first column of a config line is  a  '#'  character,  the
          rest of the line will be treated as a comment.

          Only write one option per physical line in the config file.

          Specify  the  filename  to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read
          the file from stdin.

          Note that to be able to specify a URL in the  config  file,  you
          need  to  specify  it  using the --url option, and not by simply
          writing the URL on its own line. So, it could  look  similar  to
          this:

          url = &quot;https://curl.se/docs/&quot;

          When  curl  is invoked, it (unless -q, --disable is used) checks
          for a default config file and uses it if found, even  when  this
          option  is  used.  The default config file is checked for in the
          following places in this order:

          1) Use the CURL_HOME environment variable if set

          2) Use the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable if set (Added in
          7.73.0)

          3) Use the HOME environment variable if set

          4) Non-windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory

          5) Windows: use APPDATA if set

          6) Windows: use &quot;USERPROFILE\Application Data&quot; if set

          7)  On  windows, if there is no .curlrc file in the home dir, it
          checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On
          Unix-like  systems,  it will simply try to load .curlrc from the
          determined home dir.

          # --- Example file ---
          # this is a comment
          url = &quot;example.com&quot;
          output = &quot;curlhere.html&quot;
          user-agent = &quot;superagent/1.0&quot;

          # and fetch another URL too
          url = &quot;example.com/docs/manpage.html&quot;
          -O
          referer = &quot;http://nowhereatall.example.com/&quot;
          # --- End of example file ---

          This option can be used multiple times to load  multiple  config
          files.

          Example:
           curl --config file.txt https://example.com

   --connect-timeout &lt;fractional seconds&gt;
          Maximum  time  in  seconds  that  you allow curl's connection to
          take.  This only limits the connection phase, so  if  curl  con-
          nects  within the given period it will continue - if not it will
          exit.  Since version 7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values.
          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --connect-timeout 20 https://example.com
           curl --connect-timeout 3.14 https://example.com

          See also -m, --max-time.

   --connect-to &lt;HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2&gt;

          For  a  request  to  the  given  HOST1:PORT1  pair,  connect  to
          HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct requests
          at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a clus-
          ter  of  servers. This option is only used to establish the net-
          work connection. It does NOT affect the  hostname/port  that  is
          used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the
          application protocols. &quot;HOST1&quot; and  &quot;PORT1&quot;  may  be  the  empty
          string, meaning &quot;any host/port&quot;. &quot;HOST2&quot; and &quot;PORT2&quot; may also be
          the  empty  string,  meaning   &quot;use   the   request's   original
          host/port&quot;.

          A &quot;host&quot; specified to this option is compared as a string, so it
          needs to match the name used in request URL. It  can  be  either
          numerical such as &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; or the full host name such as &quot;ex-
          ample.org&quot;.

          This option can be used many times to add many connect rules.

          Example:
           curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com

          See also --resolve and -H, --header. Added in 7.49.0.

   -C, --continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
          Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at  the  given  offset.
          The  given  offset  is  the  exact  number of bytes that will be
          skipped, counting from the beginning of the source  file  before
          it is transferred to the destination.  If used with uploads, the
          FTP server command SIZE will not be used by curl.

          Use &quot;-C -&quot; to tell curl to automatically find out  where/how  to
          resume  the  transfer. It then uses the given output/input files
          to figure that out.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -C - https://example.com
           curl -C 400 https://example.com

          See also -r, --range.

   -c, --cookie-jar &lt;filename&gt;
          (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all  cookies
          after  a  completed  operation. Curl writes all cookies from its
          in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of  opera-
          tions.  If  no  cookies  are known, no data will be written. The
          file will be written using the Netscape cookie file  format.  If
          you set the file name to a single dash, &quot;-&quot;, the cookies will be
          written to stdout.

          This command line option will activate the  cookie  engine  that
          makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is
          to use the -b, --cookie option.

          If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole curl
          operation  won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using -v,
          --verbose will get a warning displayed, but  that  is  the  only
          visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.

          If  this  option  is used several times, the last specified file
          name will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -c store-here.txt https://example.com
           curl -c store-here.txt -b read-these https://example.com

   -b, --cookie &lt;data|filename&gt;
          (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It
          is  supposedly the data previously received from the server in a
          &quot;Set-Cookie:&quot;  line.   The  data  should  be   in   the   format
          &quot;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&quot;.

          If  no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated
          as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
          also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record in-
          coming cookies, which may be handy if you're using this in  com-
          bination  with  the  -L,  --location  option  or do multiple URL
          transfers on the same invoke. If the file name is exactly a  mi-
          nus (&quot;-&quot;), curl will instead read the contents from stdin.

          The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain
          HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the  Netscape/Mozilla  cookie
          file format.

          The  file  specified with -b, --cookie is only used as input. No
          cookies will be written to the file. To store cookies,  use  the
          -c, --cookie-jar option.

          If you use the Set-Cookie file format and don't specify a domain
          then the cookie is not sent since the domain will  never  match.
          To  address  this,  set  a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing that
          will include sub-domains) or preferably: use the  Netscape  for-
          mat.

          This option can be used multiple times.

          Users very often want to both read cookies from a file and write
          updated cookies back to a file, so using both -b,  --cookie  and
          -c, --cookie-jar in the same command line is common.

          Examples:
           curl -b cookiefile https://example.com
           curl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile https://example.com

   --create-dirs
          When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl will
          create the necessary local directory hierarchy as  needed.  This
          option  creates  the directories mentioned with the -o, --output
          option, nothing else. If the --output file name uses  no  direc-
          tory, or if the directories it mentions already exist, no direc-
          tories will be created.

          Created dirs are made with mode 0750 on unix style file systems.
          To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try  --ftp-
          create-dirs.

          Example:
           curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file https://example.com

   --create-file-mode &lt;mode&gt;
          (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely using
          one of the supported protocols, this option allows the  user  to
          set which 'mode' to set on the file at creation time, instead of
          the default 0644.

          This option takes an octal number as argument.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new

          See also --ftp-create-dirs. Added in 7.75.0.

   --crlf (FTP SMTP)  Convert  LF  to  CRLF  in  upload.  Useful  for  MVS
          (OS/390).

          (SMTP added in 7.40.0)

          Example:
           curl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/

   --crlfile &lt;file&gt;
          (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate Revoca-
          tion List that may specify peer certificates that are to be con-
          sidered revoked.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --crlfile rejects.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.7.

   --curves &lt;algorithm list&gt;
          (TLS)  Tells  curl  to request specific curves to use during SSL
          session establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1.  Multiple  al-
          gorithms  can  be  provided  by  separating  them with &quot;:&quot; (e.g.
          &quot;X25519:P-521&quot;).  The parameter is available identically in  the
          &quot;openssl s_client/s_server&quot; utilities.

          --curves  allows  a OpenSSL powered curl to make SSL-connections
          with exactly the (EC) curve requested by  the  client,  avoiding
          intransparent client/server negotiations.

          If  this  option  is  set,  the  default  curves list built into
          openssl will be ignored.

          Example:
           curl --curves X25519 https://example.com

          Added in 7.73.0.

   --data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This is just an alias for -d, --data.

          Example:
           curl --data-ascii @file https://example.com

   --data-binary &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no  extra  pro-
          cessing whatsoever.

          If  you  start  the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
          filename.  Data is posted in a  similar  manner  as  -d,  --data
          does,  except  that  newlines and carriage returns are preserved
          and conversions are never done.

          Like -d, --data the default content-type sent to the  server  is
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  If  you  want the data to be
          treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the con-
          tent-type  to octet-stream: -H &quot;Content-Type: application/octet-
          stream&quot;.

          If this option is used several times,  the  ones  following  the
          first will append data as described in -d, --data.

          Example:
           curl --data-binary @filename https://example.com

   --data-raw &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP)  This  posts data similarly to -d, --data but without the
          special interpretation of the @ character.

          Examples:
           curl --data-raw &quot;hello&quot; https://example.com
           curl --data-raw &quot;@at@at@&quot; https://example.com

          See also -d, --data. Added in 7.43.0.

   --data-urlencode &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other -d, --data  options
          with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.

          To  be  CGI-compliant,  the &lt;data&gt; part should begin with a name
          followed by a separator and a content specification. The  &lt;data&gt;
          part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:

          content
                 This  will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that
                 on. Just be careful so that the content  doesn't  contain
                 any  =  or  @  symbols, as that will then make the syntax
                 match one of the other cases below!

          =content
                 This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass  that
                 on. The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.

          name=content
                 This  will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass
                 that on. Note that the name part is expected to  be  URL-
                 encoded already.

          @filename
                 This  will  make  curl load data from the given file (in-
                 cluding any newlines), URL-encode that data and  pass  it
                 on in the POST.

          name@filename
                 This  will  make  curl load data from the given file (in-
                 cluding any newlines), URL-encode that data and  pass  it
                 on  in  the  POST.  The  name part gets an equal sign ap-
                 pended, resulting in  name=urlencoded-file-content.  Note
                 that the name is expected to be URL-encoded already.

   Examples:
    curl --data-urlencode name=val https://example.com
    curl --data-urlencode =encodethis https://example.com
    curl --data-urlencode name@file https://example.com
    curl --data-urlencode @fileonly https://example.com

   See also -d, --data and --data-raw. Added in 7.18.0.

   -d, --data &lt;data&gt;
          (HTTP  MQTT)  Sends  the specified data in a POST request to the
          HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user has
          filled  in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This will
          cause curl to pass the data to the server using the content-type
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded.  Compare to -F, --form.

          --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special inter-
          pretation of the @ character. To post data  purely  binary,  you
          should  instead use the --data-binary option.  To URL-encode the
          value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.

          If any of these options is used more than once on the same  com-
          mand  line,  the  data  pieces specified will be merged together
          with a separating  &amp;-symbol.  Thus,  using  '-d  name=daniel  -d
          skill=lousy'  would  generate  a  post  chunk  that  looks  like
          'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.

          If you start the data with the letter @, the rest  should  be  a
          file  name  to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read
          the data from stdin. Posting data from  a  file  named  'foobar'
          would  thus  be done with -d, --data @foobar. When -d, --data is
          told to read from a file like that, carriage  returns  and  new-
          lines will be stripped out. If you don't want the @ character to
          have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.

          Examples:
           curl -d &quot;name=curl&quot; https://example.com
           curl -d &quot;name=curl&quot; -d &quot;tool=cmdline&quot; https://example.com
           curl -d @filename https://example.com

          See also --data-binary, --data-urlencode  and  --data-raw.  This
          option  overrides  -F,  --form  and -I, --head and -T, --upload-
          file.

   --delegation &lt;LEVEL&gt;
          (GSS/kerberos) Set LEVEL to tell the server what it  is  allowed
          to delegate when it comes to user credentials.

          none   Don't allow any delegation.

          policy Delegates  if  and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set
                 in the Kerberos service ticket,  which  is  a  matter  of
                 realm policy.

          always Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

   If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

   Example:
    curl --delegation &quot;none&quot; https://example.com

   --digest
          (HTTP)  Enables HTTP Digest authentication. This is an authenti-
          cation scheme that prevents the password from  being  sent  over
          the  wire in clear text. Use this in combination with the normal
          -u, --user option to set user name and password.

          If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
          used.

          Example:
           curl -u name:password --digest https://example.com

          See  also  -u, --user, --proxy-digest and --anyauth. This option
          overrides --basic and --ntlm and --negotiate.

   --disable-eprt
          (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands
          when doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first
          attempt to use EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with  this
          option,  it  will  use PORT right away. EPRT and LPRT are exten-
          sions to the original FTP protocol, and  may  not  work  on  all
          servers, but they enable more functionality in a better way than
          the traditional PORT command.

          --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and --no-eprt
          is an alias for --disable-eprt.

          If  the  server is accessed using IPv6, this option will have no
          effect as EPRT is necessary then.

          Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you want  to
          switch  to  passive  mode  you need to not use -P, --ftp-port or
          force it with --ftp-pasv.

          Example:
           curl --disable-eprt ftp://example.com/

   --disable-epsv
          (FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPSV command when  do-
          ing  passive  FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first at-
          tempt to use EPSV before PASV, but with this option, it will not
          try using EPSV.

          --epsv can be used to explicitly enable EPSV again and --no-epsv
          is an alias for --disable-epsv.

          If the server is an IPv6 host, this option will have  no  effect
          as EPSV is necessary then.

          Disabling EPSV only changes the passive behavior. If you want to
          switch to active mode you need to use -P, --ftp-port.

          Example:
           curl --disable-epsv ftp://example.com/

   -q, --disable
          If used as the first parameter on the command line,  the  curlrc
          config  file will not be read and used. See the -K, --config for
          details on the default config file search path.

          Example:
           curl -q https://example.com

   --disallow-username-in-url
          (HTTP) This tells curl to exit if  passed  a  url  containing  a
          username.  This  is  probably  most useful when the URL is being
          provided at run-time or similar.

          Example:
           curl --disallow-username-in-url https://example.com

          See also --proto. Added in 7.61.0.

   --dns-interface &lt;interface&gt;
          (DNS) Tell curl to send outgoing DNS  requests  through  &lt;inter-
          face&gt;.  This  option is a counterpart to --interface (which does
          not affect DNS). The supplied string must be an  interface  name
          (not an address).

          Example:
           curl --dns-interface eth0 https://example.com

          See  also  --dns-ipv4-addr  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-interface
          requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
          ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --dns-ipv4-addr &lt;address&gt;
          (DNS) Tell curl to bind to &lt;ip-address&gt; when making IPv4 DNS re-
          quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.
          The argument should be a single IPv4 address.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dns-ipv4-addr 10.1.2.3 https://example.com

          See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv6-addr. --dns-ipv4-addr
          requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
          ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --dns-ipv6-addr &lt;address&gt;
          (DNS) Tell curl to bind to &lt;ip-address&gt; when making IPv6 DNS re-
          quests, so that the DNS requests originate  from  this  address.
          The argument should be a single IPv6 address.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dns-ipv6-addr 2a04:4e42::561 https://example.com

          See  also  --dns-interface  and --dns-ipv4-addr. --dns-ipv6-addr
          requires that the underlying libcurl was  built  to  support  c-
          ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --dns-servers &lt;addresses&gt;
          Set the list of DNS servers to be used instead of the system de-
          fault.  The list of IP addresses should be separated  with  com-
          mas. Port numbers may also optionally be given as :&lt;port-number&gt;
          after each IP address.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dns-servers 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 https://example.com

          --dns-servers requires that the underlying libcurl was built  to
          support c-ares. Added in 7.33.0.

   --doh-cert-status
          (all) Same as --cert-status but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

          Example:
           curl --doh-cert-status --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.76.0.

   --doh-insecure
          (all) Same as -k, --insecure but used for DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS).

          Example:
           curl --doh-insecure --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.76.0.

   --doh-url &lt;URL&gt;
          (all)  Specifies which DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server to use to re-
          solve hostnames, instead of  using  the  default  name  resolver
          mechanism. The URL must be HTTPS.

          Some  SSL  options  that you set for your transfer will apply to
          DoH since the name lookups take place  over  SSL.  However,  the
          certificate  verification  settings are not inherited and can be
          controlled separately via --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --doh-url https://doh.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.62.0.

   -D, --dump-header &lt;filename&gt;
          (HTTP FTP) Write the received protocol headers to the  specified
          file.  If  no  headers are received, the use of this option will
          create an empty file.

          When used in FTP, the FTP server response lines  are  considered
          being &quot;headers&quot; and thus are saved there.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --dump-header store.txt https://example.com

          See also -o, --output.

   --egd-file &lt;file&gt;
          (TLS)  Specify  the  path  name  to the Entropy Gathering Daemon
          socket. The socket is used to seed the  random  engine  for  SSL
          connections.

          Example:
           curl --egd-file /random/here https://example.com

          See also --random-file.

   --engine &lt;name&gt;
          (TLS)  Select the OpenSSL crypto engine to use for cipher opera-
          tions. Use --engine list to print a list of build-time supported
          engines.  Note  that  not all (and possibly none) of the engines
          may be available at run-time.

          Example:
           curl --engine flavor https://example.com

   --etag-compare &lt;file&gt;
          (HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for the spe-
          cific ETag read from the given file by sending a custom If-None-
          Match header using the stored ETag.

          For correct results, make sure that the specified file  contains
          only  a  single  line  with  the  desired ETag. An empty file is
          parsed as an empty ETag.

          Use the option --etag-save to first save the  ETag  from  a  re-
          sponse,  and  then  use this option to compare against the saved
          ETag in a subsequent request.

          Example:
           curl --etag-compare etag.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.68.0.

   --etag-save &lt;file&gt;
          (HTTP) This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified file.  An
          ETag  is  a  caching  related  header, usually returned in a re-
          sponse.

          If no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is created.

          Example:
           curl --etag-save storetag.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.68.0.

   --expect100-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
          (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a
          100-continue  response  when curl emits an Expects: 100-continue
          header in its request. By default curl  will  wait  one  second.
          This  option accepts decimal values! When curl stops waiting, it
          will continue as if the response has been received.

          Example:
           curl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T file https://example.com

          See also --connect-timeout. Added in 7.47.0.

   --fail-early
          Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.

          When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command  line,
          it will attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By de-
          fault, it will ignore errors if there are more  URLs  given  and
          the  last  URL's  success will determine the error code curl re-
          turns. So early failures will be &quot;hidden&quot; by subsequent success-
          ful transfers.

          Using  this  option,  curl  will  instead return an error on the
          first transfer that fails, independent of  the  amount  of  URLs
          that  are given on the command line. This way, no transfer fail-
          ures go undetected by scripts and similar.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          This option does not imply -f, --fail, which causes transfers to
          fail due to the server's HTTP status code. You can  combine  the
          two options, however note -f, --fail is not global and is there-
          fore contained by -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example

          Added in 7.52.0.
   --fail-with-body
          (HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP  response
          code  is  400  or  greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server
          fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating
          so  (which  often  also  describes why and more). This flag will
          still allow curl to output and save that content but also to re-
          turn error 22.

          This  is  an  alternative  option to -f, --fail which makes curl
          fail for the same circumstances but without saving the content.

          Example:
           curl --fail-with-body https://example.com

          See also -f, --fail. Added in 7.76.0.

   -f, --fail
          (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server  errors.  This
          is  mostly done to enable scripts etc to better deal with failed
          attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a
          document,  it  returns  an HTML document stating so (which often
          also describes why and more). This flag will prevent  curl  from
          outputting that and return error 22.

          This  method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-
          successful response codes will slip through, especially when au-
          thentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).

          Example:
           curl --fail https://example.com

          See also --fail-with-body.

   --false-start
          (TLS)  Tells  curl  to use false start during the TLS handshake.
          False start is a mode where a TLS client will start sending  ap-
          plication  data  before verifying the server's Finished message,
          thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.

          This is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure  Trans-
          port (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.

          Example:
           curl --false-start https://example.com

          Added in 7.42.0.

   --form-string &lt;name=string&gt;
          (HTTP  SMTP  IMAP)  Similar  to -F, --form except that the value
          string for the named parameter is used  literally.  Leading  '@'
          and '&lt;' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no
          special meaning. Use this in preference to -F, --form if there's
          any  possibility  that the string value may accidentally trigger
          the '@' or '&lt;' features of -F, --form.

          Example:
           curl --form-string &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See also -F, --form.

   -F, --form &lt;name=content&gt;
          (HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets  curl  emu-
          late  a  filled-in  form  in which a user has pressed the submit
          button. This causes curl to POST  data  using  the  Content-Type
          multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.

          For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a mul-
          tipart mail message to transmit.

          This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force  the  'con-
          tent' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
          just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with
          the  symbol  &lt;.  The  difference  between @ and &lt; is then that @
          makes a file get attached in the post as a  file  upload,  while
          the &lt; makes a text field and just get the contents for that text
          field from a file.

          Tell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by  using
          - as filename. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs. When stdin
          is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to de-
          termine its size and allow a possible resend.  Defining a part's
          data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or sim-
          ilar)  is unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be ef-
          fectively read at transmission time; since the full size is  un-
          known before the transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by
          HTTP and rejected by IMAP.

          Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the
          name  of  the  form-field to which the file portrait.jpg will be
          the input:

           curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi

          Example: send your name and shoe size in two text fields to  the
          server:

           curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/

          Example:  send your essay in a text field to the server. Send it
          as a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a  local
          file:

           curl -F &quot;story=&lt;hugefile.txt&quot; https://example.com/

          You  can  also  tell  curl  what  Content-Type  to  use by using
          'type=', in a manner similar to:

           curl -F &quot;web=@index.html;type=text/html&quot; example.com

          or

           curl -F &quot;name=daniel;type=text/foo&quot; example.com

          You can also explicitly change the name field of a  file  upload
          part by setting filename=, like this:

           curl -F &quot;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&quot; example.com

          If  filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by dou-
          ble-quotes like:

           curl -F &quot;file=@\&quot;local,file\&quot;;filename=\&quot;name;in;post\&quot;&quot;  exam-
          ple.com

          or

           curl   -F   'file=@&quot;local,file&quot;;filename=&quot;name;in;post&quot;'  exam-
          ple.com

          Note that if a filename/path is  quoted  by  double-quotes,  any
          double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
          backslash.

          Quoting must also be applied to non-file  data  if  it  contains
          semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:

           curl  -F  'colors=&quot;red;  green;  blue&quot;;type=text/x-myapp' exam-
          ple.com

          You can add custom headers to the  field  by  setting  headers=,
          like

            curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=\&quot;X-submit-type: OK\&quot;&quot; example.com

          or

            curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=@headerfile&quot; example.com

          The  headers=  keyword may appear more that once and above notes
          about quoting apply. When headers are read from  a  file,  Empty
          lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each
          header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting
          the  continuation  line  with a space; embedded carriage-returns
          and trailing spaces are stripped.   Here  is  an  example  of  a
          header file contents:

            # This file contain two headers.
            X-header-1: this is a header

            # The following header is folded.
            X-header-2: this is
             another header

          To  support  sending  multipart mail messages, the syntax is ex-
          tended as follows:
          - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character  of
          the argument,
          -  if  data  starts with '(', this signals to start a new multi-
          part: it can be followed by a content type specification.
          - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.

          Example: the following command sends an SMTP  mime  e-mail  con-
          sisting in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text
          and HTML. It attaches a text file:

           curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \
                   -F '=plain text message' \
                   -F '= &lt;body&gt;HTML message&lt;/body&gt;;type=text/html' \
                -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com

          Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=.  Available  en-
          codings are binary and 8bit that do nothing else than adding the
          corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, 7bit  that  only
          rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error, quoted-printable
          and base64 that encodes  data  according  to  the  corresponding
          schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.

          Example:  send  multipart mail with a quoted-printable text mes-
          sage and a base64 attached file:

           curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \
                -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com

          See further examples and details in the MANUAL.

          This option can be used multiple times.

          Example:
           curl --form &quot;name=curl&quot; --form &quot;file=@loadthis&quot; https://example.com

          This option overrides -d, --data and -I, --head  and  -T,  --up-
          load-file.

   --ftp-account &lt;data&gt;
          (FTP) When an FTP server asks for &quot;account data&quot; after user name
          and password has been provided, this data is sent off using  the
          ACCT command.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-account &quot;mr.robot&quot; ftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.13.0.

   --ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt;
          (FTP)  If  authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,
          send this  command.   When  connecting  to  Tumbleweed's  Secure
          Transport  server  over  FTPS  using a client certificate, using
          &quot;SITE AUTH&quot; will tell the server to retrieve the  username  from
          the certificate.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-alternative-to-user &quot;U53r&quot; ftp://example.com

          Added in 7.15.5.

   --ftp-create-dirs
          (FTP  SFTP)  When  an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that
          doesn't currently exist on the server, the standard behavior  of
          curl is to fail. Using this option, curl will instead attempt to
          create missing directories.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file

          See also --create-dirs.

   --ftp-method &lt;method&gt;
          (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on  an
          FTP(S)  server. The method argument should be one of the follow-
          ing alternatives:

          multicwd
                 curl does a single CWD operation for each  path  part  in
                 the  given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very many
                 commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it  should  be  done.
                 This is the default but the slowest behavior.

          nocwd  curl  does  no  CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR
                 etc and give a full path to the server for all these com-
                 mands. This is the fastest behavior.

          singlecwd
                 curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then
                 operates on the file &quot;normally&quot;  (like  in  the  multicwd
                 case).  This  is  somewhat  more standards compliant than
                 'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'.

   Examples:
    curl --ftp-method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
    curl --ftp-method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file
    curl --ftp-method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file

   Added in 7.15.1.

   --ftp-pasv
          (FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive  is  the
          internal  default behavior, but using this option can be used to
          override a previous -P, --ftp-port option.

          If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
          used.  Undoing  an  enforced passive really isn't doable but you
          must then instead enforce the correct -P, --ftp-port again.

          Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first and
          then PASV, unless --disable-epsv is used.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-pasv ftp://example.com/

          See also --disable-epsv. Added in 7.11.0.

   -P, --ftp-port &lt;address&gt;
          (FTP)  Reverses  the  default initiator/listener roles when con-
          necting with FTP. This option makes curl use active  mode.  curl
          then  tells the server to connect back to the client's specified
          address and port, while passive mode asks the server to setup an
          IP  address  and  port for it to connect to. &lt;address&gt; should be
          one of:

          interface
                 e.g. &quot;eth0&quot; to specify which interface's IP  address  you
                 want to use (Unix only)

          IP address
                 e.g. &quot;192.168.10.1&quot; to specify the exact IP address

          host name
                 e.g. &quot;my.host.domain&quot; to specify the machine

          -      make  curl  pick the same IP address that is already used
                 for the control connection

   If this option is used several times, the last one will be  used.  Dis-
   able  the  use  of PORT with --ftp-pasv. Disable the attempt to use the
   EPRT command instead of PORT by using --disable-eprt.  EPRT  is  really
   PORT++.

   Since  7.19.5,  you can append &quot;:[start]-[end]&quot; to the right of the ad-
   dress, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means you  specify
   a port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number works as
   well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the  port
   may not be available.

   Examples:
    curl -P - ftp:/example.com
    curl -P eth0 ftp:/example.com
    curl -P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com

   See also --ftp-pasv and --disable-eprt.

   --ftp-pret
          (FTP)  Tell  curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV).
          Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd,  require  this  non-standard
          command  for  directory  listings as well as up and downloads in
          PASV mode.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-pret ftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.20.0.

   --ftp-skip-pasv-ip
          (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in
          its  response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data
          connection. Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it  al-
          ready uses for the control connection.

          Since curl 7.74.0 this option is enabled by default.

          This  option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used instead
          of PASV.
          Example:
           curl --ftp-skip-pasv-ip ftp://example.com/

          See also --ftp-pasv. Added in 7.14.2.

   --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode &lt;active/passive&gt;
          (FTP) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate  the
          shutdown, but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not
          reply to the shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates
          the shutdown and waits for a reply from the server.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode active --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

          See also --ftp-ssl-ccc. Added in 7.16.2.

   --ftp-ssl-ccc
          (FTP)  Use  CCC  (Clear  Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS
          layer after authenticating. The rest of the control channel com-
          munication  will be unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to fol-
          low the FTP transaction. The default mode is passive.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-ssl-ccc ftps://example.com/

          See also --ssl and --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode. Added in 7.16.1.

   --ftp-ssl-control
          (FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP  login,  clear  for  transfer.
          Allows  secure  authentication, but non-encrypted data transfers
          for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the server  doesn't  sup-
          port SSL/TLS.

          Example:
           curl --ftp-ssl-control ftp://example.com

          Added in 7.16.0.

   -G, --get
          When  used,  this  option  will make all data specified with -d,
          --data, --data-binary or --data-urlencode to be used in an  HTTP
          GET  request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be
          used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.
          If used in combination with -I, --head, the POST data  will  in-
          stead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

          If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
          used. This is because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but  you
          should then instead enforce the alternative method you prefer.

          Examples:
           curl --get https://example.com
           curl --get -d &quot;tool=curl&quot; -d &quot;age=old&quot; https://example.com
           curl --get -I -d &quot;tool=curl&quot; https://example.com

   -g, --globoff
          This option switches off the &quot;URL globbing parser&quot;. When you set
          this option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters  {}[]
          without  having curl itself interpret them. Note that these let-
          ters are not normal legal URL contents but they  should  be  en-
          coded according to the URI standard.

          Example:
           curl -g &quot;https://example.com/{[]}}}}&quot;

   --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms &lt;milliseconds&gt;
          Happy  Eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both
          IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for  dual-stack  hosts,  giving  IPv6  a
          head-start  of the specified number of milliseconds. If the IPv6
          address cannot be connected to within that time, then a  connec-
          tion  attempt is made to the IPv4 address in parallel. The first
          connection to be established is the one that is used.

          The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy  Eyeballs
          RFC  6555  says  &quot;It  is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts be
          paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors against  network
          load.&quot;  libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome
          currently default to 300 ms.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms 500 https://example.com

          Added in 7.59.0.

   --haproxy-protocol
          (HTTP) Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the  beginning
          of  the  connection. This is used by some load balancers and re-
          verse proxies to indicate the client's true IP address and port.
          This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to  a
          service that expects this header.

          Example:
           curl --haproxy-protocol https://example.com

          Added in 7.60.0.

   -I, --head
          (HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the
          command HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of  a
          document.  When  used  on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the
          file size and last modification time only.

          Example:
           curl -I https://example.com
   -H, --header &lt;header/@file&gt;
          (HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending  HTTP
          to  a  server. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note
          that if you should add a custom header that has the same name as
          one  of  the  internal  ones curl would use, your externally set
          header will be used instead of the internal one. This allows you
          to  make  even  trickier  stuff than curl would normally do. You
          should not replace internally set headers without  knowing  per-
          fectly well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by giv-
          ing a replacement without content  on  the  right  side  of  the
          colon, as in: -H &quot;Host:&quot;. If you send the custom header with no-
          value then its header must be terminated with a semicolon,  such
          as -H &quot;X-Custom-Header;&quot; to send &quot;X-Custom-Header:&quot;.

          curl  will  make  sure  that each header you add/replace is sent
          with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
          as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
          returns, they will only mess things up for you.

          This option can take an argument in @filename style, which  then
          adds  a  header  for  each line in the input file. Using @- will
          make curl read the header file from stdin. Added in 7.55.0.

          You need --proxy-header to send custom headers  intended  for  a
          HTTP proxy. Added in 7.37.0.

          Passing  on  a  &quot;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&quot; header when doing a
          HTTP request with a request body, will make curl send  the  data
          using chunked encoding.

          WARNING:  headers  set  with  this option will be set in all re-
          quests - even after redirects are followed, like when told  with
          -L,  --location. This can lead to the header being sent to other
          hosts than the original host, so  sensitive  headers  should  be
          used with caution combined with following redirects.

          This  option  can  be  used multiple times to add/replace/remove
          multiple headers.

          Examples:
           curl -H &quot;X-First-Name: Joe&quot; https://example.com
           curl -H &quot;User-Agent: yes-please/2000&quot; https://example.com
           curl -H &quot;Host:&quot; https://example.com

          See also -A, --user-agent and -e, --referer.

   -h, --help &lt;category&gt;
          Usage help. This lists all commands of the  &lt;category&gt;.   If  no
          arg  was  provided, curl will display the most important command
          line arguments.  If the argument &quot;all&quot; was provided,  curl  will
          display  all  options available.  If the argument &quot;category&quot; was
          provided, curl will display all categories and their meanings.

          Example:
           curl --help all

   --hostpubmd5 &lt;md5&gt;
          (SFTP SCP) Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal  digits.  The
          string  should  be the 128 bit MD5 checksum of the remote host's
          public key, curl will refuse the connection with the host unless
          the md5sums match.

          Example:
           curl --hostpubmd5 e5c1c49020640a5ab0f2034854c321a8 sftp://example.com/

          Added in 7.17.1.

   --hsts &lt;file name&gt;
          (HTTPS)  This  option enables HSTS for the transfer. If the file
          name points to an existing HSTS cache file, that will  be  used.
          After  a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file
          name again if it has been modified.

          Specify a &quot;&quot; file name (zero length) to avoid loading/saving and
          make curl just handle HSTS in memory.

          If  this  option  is used several times, curl will load contents
          from all the files but the last one will be used for saving.

          Example:
           curl --hsts cache.txt https://example.com

          Added in 7.74.0.

   --http0.9
          (HTTP) Tells curl to be fine with HTTP version 0.9 response.

          HTTP/0.9 is a completely headerless response and  therefore  you
          can  also  connect with this to non-HTTP servers and still get a
          response since curl will simply transparently downgrade - if al-
          lowed.

          Since curl 7.66.0, HTTP/0.9 is disabled by default.

          Example:
           curl --http0.9 https://example.com

   -0, --http1.0
          (HTTP)  Tells  curl to use HTTP version 1.0 instead of using its
          internally preferred HTTP version.

          Example:
           curl --http1.0 https://example.com

          This option overrides --http1.1 and --http2.

   --http1.1
          (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1.

          Example:
           curl --http1.1 https://example.com

          This option  overrides  -0,  --http1.0  and  --http2.  Added  in
          7.33.0.

   --http2-prior-knowledge
          (HTTP)  Tells  curl  to  issue  its  non-TLS HTTP requests using
          HTTP/2 without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade.  It  requires  prior  knowledge
          that  the  server  supports HTTP/2 straight away. HTTPS requests
          will still do HTTP/2 the standard way with  negotiated  protocol
          version in the TLS handshake.

          Example:
           curl --http2-prior-knowledge https://example.com

          --http2-prior-knowledge requires that the underlying libcurl was
          built to support HTTP/2. This option overrides --http1.1 and -0,
          --http1.0 and --http2. Added in 7.49.0.

   --http2
          (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP version 2.

          For  HTTPS,  this means curl will attempt to negotiate HTTP/2 in
          the TLS handshake. curl does this by default.

          For HTTP, this means curl will attempt to upgrade the request to
          HTTP/2 using the Upgrade: request header.

          Example:
           curl --http2 https://example.com

          See also --http1.1 and --http3. --http2 requires that the under-
          lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/2. This option overrides
          --http1.1  and  -0, --http1.0 and --http2-prior-knowledge. Added
          in 7.33.0.

   --http3
          (HTTP) WARNING: this option is experimental. Do not use in  pro-
          duction.

          Tells  curl  to use HTTP version 3 directly to the host and port
          number used in the URL. A normal HTTP/3 transaction will be done
          to  a  host and then get redirected via Alt-Svc, but this option
          allows a user to circumvent that when you know that  the  target
          speaks HTTP/3 on the given host and port.

          This  option  will make curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be
          established, it cannot fall back to a lower HTTP version on  its
          own.

          Example:
           curl --http3 https://example.com

          See also --http1.1 and --http2. --http3 requires that the under-
          lying libcurl was built to support HTTP/3. This option overrides
          --http1.1 and -0, --http1.0 and --http2 and --http2-prior-knowl-
          edge. Added in 7.66.0.

   --ignore-content-length
          (FTP HTTP) For HTTP, Ignore the Content-Length header.  This  is
          particularly  useful  for servers running Apache 1.x, which will
          report incorrect Content-Length for files larger  than  2  giga-
          bytes.

          For  FTP (since 7.46.0), skip the RETR command to figure out the
          size before downloading a file.

          This option doesn't work for HTTP if libcurl was  built  to  use
          hyper.

          Example:
           curl --ignore-content-length https://example.com

   -i, --include
          Include  the  HTTP  response headers in the output. The HTTP re-
          sponse headers can include things  like  server  name,  cookies,
          date of the document, HTTP version and more...

          To view the request headers, consider the -v, --verbose option.

          Example:
           curl -i https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose.

   -k, --insecure
          (TLS) By default, every SSL connection curl makes is verified to
          be secure. This option allows curl to proceed and  operate  even
          for server connections otherwise considered insecure.

          The  server  connection  is verified by making sure the server's
          certificate contains the right name  and  verifies  successfully
          using the cert store.

          See this online resource for further details:
           https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

          WARNING: this makes the transfer insecure.

          Example:
           curl --insecure https://example.com

          See also --proxy-insecure and --cacert.

   --interface &lt;name&gt;

          Perform  an operation using a specified interface. You can enter
          interface name, IP address or host name. An example  could  look
          like:

           curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          On  Linux  it can be used to specify a VRF, but the binary needs
          to either have CAP_NET_RAW or to be run as root.  More  informa-
          tion   about  Linux  VRF:  https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documenta-
          tion/networking/vrf.txt

          Example:
           curl --interface eth0 https://example.com

          See also --dns-interface.

   -4, --ipv4
          This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv4 addresses  only,
          and not for example try IPv6.

          Example:
           curl --ipv4 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and  --http2.  This  option  overrides -6,
          --ipv6.

   -6, --ipv6
          This option tells curl to resolve names to IPv6 addresses  only,
          and not for example try IPv4.

          Example:
           curl --ipv6 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and  --http2.  This  option  overrides -4,
          --ipv4.

   -j, --junk-session-cookies
          (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this
          option will make it discard all &quot;session cookies&quot;. This will ba-
          sically have the same effect as if a  new  session  is  started.
          Typical  browsers  always  discard  session cookies when they're
          closed down.

          Example:
           curl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txt https://example.com

          See also -b, --cookie and -c, --cookie-jar.

   --keepalive-time &lt;seconds&gt;
          This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle  be-
          fore  sending  keepalive  probes and the time between individual
          keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems
          offering  the  TCP_KEEPIDLE  and  TCP_KEEPINTVL  socket  options
          (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more). This option has  no
          effect if --no-keepalive is used.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.

          Example:
           curl --keepalive-time 20 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   --key-type &lt;type&gt;
          (TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your --key  pro-
          vided  private  key  is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not
          specified, PEM is assumed.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --key-type DER --key here https://example.com

   --key &lt;key&gt;
          (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your pri-
          vate  key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified, curl
          tries  the  following  candidates  in  order:   '~/.ssh/id_rsa',
          '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.

          If  curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11
          is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to spec-
          ify  a  private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A string begin-
          ning with &quot;pkcs11:&quot; will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI.  If  a
          PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option will be set as
          &quot;pkcs11&quot; if none was provided and the --key-type option will  be
          set as &quot;ENG&quot; if none was provided.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --cert certificate --key here https://example.com

   --krb &lt;level&gt;
          (FTP)  Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be
          entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or
          'private'.  Should  you  use  a  level that is not one of these,
          'private' will instead be used.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/

          --krb requires that the underlying libcurl was built to  support
          Kerberos.

   --libcurl &lt;file&gt;
          Append  this  option  to any ordinary curl command line, and you
          will get libcurl-using C source code written to  the  file  that
          does the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last given  file  name
          will be used.

          Example:
           curl --libcurl client.c https://example.com

          Added in 7.16.1.

   --limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;
          Specify  the  maximum  transfer  rate you want curl to use - for
          both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a
          limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire
          bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.

          The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix  is
          appended.   Appending  'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilo-
          bytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes  it
          gigabytes.  The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For ex-
          ample 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

          If you also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that  option  will
          take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to
          help keeping the speed-limit logic working.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --limit-rate 100K https://example.com
           curl --limit-rate 1000 https://example.com
           curl --limit-rate 10M https://example.com

   -l, --list-only
          (FTP POP3) (FTP) When listing  an  FTP  directory,  this  switch
          forces  a  name-only view. This is especially useful if the user
          wants to machine-parse the contents of an  FTP  directory  since
          the normal directory view doesn't use a standard look or format.
          When used like this, the option causes an  NLST  command  to  be
          sent to the server instead of LIST.

          Note:  Some  FTP  servers  list  only files in their response to
          NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.

          (POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3,  this  switch
          forces  a  LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This is
          particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific  mes-
          sage-id exists on the server and what size it is.

          Note:  When combined with -X, --request, this option can be used
          to send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the  email's
          unique  identifier  rather  than  its message-id to make the re-
          quest.

          Example:
           curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/

          Added in 4.0.

   --local-port &lt;num/range&gt;
          Set a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of  local  port
          numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port numbers by
          nature are a scarce resource that will be busy at times so  set-
          ting  this range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary
          connection setup failures.

          Example:
           curl --local-port 1000-3000 https://example.com

          Added in 7.15.2.

   --location-trusted
          (HTTP) Like -L, --location, but will allow sending  the  name  +
          password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or
          may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to
          a  site  to which you'll send your authentication info (which is
          plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).

          Example:
           curl --location-trusted -u user:password https://example.com

          See also -u, --user.

   -L, --location
          (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page  has  moved
          to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a
          3XX response code), this option will make curl redo the  request
          on  the  new  place.  If used together with -i, --include or -I,
          --head, headers from all requested pages will be shown. When au-
          thentication  is  used,  curl  only sends its credentials to the
          initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different  host,  it
          won't  be  able to intercept the user+password. See also --loca-
          tion-trusted on how to change this. You can limit the amount  of
          redirects to follow by using the --max-redirs option.

          When  curl  follows  a redirect and if the request is a POST, it
          will send the following request with a GET if the HTTP  response
          was  301,  302,  or  303. If the response code was any other 3xx
          code, curl will re-send the following request using the same un-
          modified method.

          You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x
          response by using the dedicated  options  for  that:  --post301,
          --post302 and --post303.

          The  method  set  with  -X,  --request overrides the method curl
          would otherwise select to use.

          Example:
           curl -L https://example.com

   --login-options &lt;options&gt;
          (IMAP POP3 SMTP) Specify the login options to use during  server
          authentication.

          You  can  use login options to specify protocol specific options
          that may be used during authentication. At  present  only  IMAP,
          POP3  and SMTP support login options. For more information about
          login options please see RFC  2384,  RFC  5092  and  IETF  draft
          draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --mail-auth &lt;address&gt;
          (SMTP)  Specify  a  single address. This will be used to specify
          the authentication address (identity)  of  a  submitted  message
          that is being relayed to another server.

          Example:
           curl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/

          See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-from. Added in 7.25.0.

   --mail-from &lt;address&gt;
          (SMTP)  Specify  a single address that the given mail should get
          sent from.

          Example:
           curl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/

          See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-auth. Added in 7.20.0.

   --mail-rcpt-allowfails
          (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl
          will  abort  SMTP conversation if at least one of the recipients
          causes RCPT TO command to return an error.

          The default behavior can be changed by  passing  --mail-rcpt-al-
          lowfails  command-line option which will make curl ignore errors
          and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.

          If all recipients trigger RCPT TO  failures  and  this  flag  is
          specified,  curl  will still abort the SMTP conversation and re-
          turn the error received from to the last RCPT TO command.

          Example:
           curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com

          Added in 7.69.0.

   --mail-rcpt &lt;address&gt;
          (SMTP) Specify a single e-mail address,  user  name  or  mailing
          list  name. Repeat this option several times to send to multiple
          recipients.

          When performing an address verification (VRFY command), the  re-
          cipient  should  be  specified as the user name or user name and
          domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC5321). (Added in 7.34.0)

          When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the recip-
          ient  should  be  specified using the mailing list name, such as
          &quot;Friends&quot; or &quot;London-Office&quot;.  (Added in 7.34.0)

          Example:
           curl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com

          Added in 7.20.0.

   -M, --manual
          Manual. Display the huge help text.

          Example:
           curl --manual

   --max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;
          (FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to
          download.  If  the file requested is larger than this value, the
          transfer will not start and curl will return with exit code 63.

          A size modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k'  or  'K'
          will  count  the  number  as  kilobytes,  'm'  or  'M'  makes it
          megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples:  200K,
          3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)

          NOTE:  The  file size is not always known prior to download, and
          for such files this option has no effect even if the file trans-
          fer ends up being larger than this given limit.  Example:
           curl --max-filesize 100K https://example.com

          See also --limit-rate.

   --max-redirs &lt;num&gt;
          (HTTP)  Set  maximum  number of redirections to follow. When -L,
          --location is used, to prevent  curl  from  following  too  many
          redirects,  by  default,  the  limit is set to 50 redirects. Set
          this option to -1 to make it unlimited.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --max-redirs 3 --location https://example.com

   -m, --max-time &lt;fractional seconds&gt;
          Maximum time in seconds that you allow the  whole  operation  to
          take.   This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hang-
          ing for hours due to slow networks or links going  down.   Since
          7.32.0, this option accepts decimal values, but the actual time-
          out will decrease in accuracy as the specified timeout increases
          in decimal precision.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --max-time 10 https://example.com
           curl --max-time 2.92 https://example.com

          See also --connect-timeout.

   --metalink
          This  option was previously used to specify a metalink resource.
          Metalink support has been disabled in curl since 7.78.0 for  se-
          curity reasons.

          Example:
           curl --metalink file https://example.com

          Added in 7.27.0.

   --negotiate
          (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.

          This  option  requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI sup-
          port. Use -V, --version  to  see  if  your  curl  supports  GSS-
          API/SSPI or SPNEGO.

          When  using this option, you must also provide a fake -u, --user
          option to activate the authentication code properly.  Sending  a
          '-u  :'  is  enough  as  the user name and password from the -u,
          --user option aren't actually used.

          If this option is used several times,  only  the  first  one  is
          used.

          Example:
           curl --negotiate -u : https://example.com

          See also --basic, --ntlm, --anyauth and --proxy-negotiate.

   --netrc-file &lt;filename&gt;
          This  option  is similar to -n, --netrc, except that you provide
          the path (absolute or relative) to  the  netrc  file  that  curl
          should use.  You can only specify one netrc file per invocation.
          If several --netrc-file options are provided, the last one  will
          be used.

          It will abide by --netrc-optional if specified.

          Example:
           curl --netrc-file netrc https://example.com

          This option overrides -n, --netrc. Added in 7.21.5.

   --netrc-optional
          Very  similar  to  -n, --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc
          usage optional and not mandatory as the -n, --netrc option does.

          Example:
           curl --netrc-optional https://example.com

          See also --netrc-file. This option overrides -n, --netrc.

   -n, --netrc
          Makes curl scan the .netrc  (_netrc  on  Windows)  file  in  the
          user's home directory for login name and password. This is typi-
          cally used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will  enable
          user  authentication. See netrc(5) and ftp(1) for details on the
          file format. Curl will not complain if that  file  doesn't  have
          the  right  permissions  (it should be neither world- nor group-
          readable). The environment variable &quot;HOME&quot; is used to  find  the
          home directory.

          A  quick and very simple example of how to setup a .netrc to al-
          low curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com  with  user  name
          'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:

          machine host.domain.com login myself password secret

          Example:
           curl --netrc https://example.com

   -:, --next
          Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
          associated options. This allows you  to  send  several  URL  re-
          quests,  each with their own specific options, for example, such
          as different user names or custom requests for each.

          -:, --next will reset all local options  and  only  global  ones
          will  have  their values survive over to the operation following
          the -:, --next instruction. Global options  include  -v,  --ver-
          bose, --trace, --trace-ascii and --fail-early.

          For  example,  you can do both a GET and a POST in a single com-
          mand line:

           curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com

          Examples:
           curl https://example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com
           curl -I https://example.com --next https://example.net/

          Added in 7.36.0.

   --no-alpn
          (HTTPS) Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled  by  de-
          fault  if  libcurl  was  built with an SSL library that supports
          ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to  negoti-
          ate HTTP/2 support with the server during https sessions.

          Example:
           curl --no-alpn https://example.com

          See  also  --no-npn and --http2. --no-alpn requires that the un-
          derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

   -N, --no-buffer
          Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal work sit-
          uations,  curl  will  use a standard buffered output stream that
          will have the effect that it will output the data in chunks, not
          necessarily  exactly  when  the data arrives.  Using this option
          will disable that buffering.

          Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
          thus use --buffer to enforce the buffering.

          Example:
           curl --no-buffer https://example.com

   --no-keepalive
          Disables  the  use  of keepalive messages on the TCP connection.
          curl otherwise enables them by default.

          Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
          thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.

          Example:
           curl --no-keepalive https://example.com

   --no-npn
          (HTTPS) Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default
          if libcurl was built with an SSL library that supports NPN.  NPN
          is  used  by  a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2
          support with the server during https sessions.

          Example:
           curl --no-npn https://example.com

          See also --no-alpn and --http2. --no-npn requires that  the  un-
          derlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in 7.36.0.

   --no-progress-meter
          Option to switch off the progress meter output without muting or
          otherwise affecting warning and informational messages like  -s,
          --silent does.

          Note  that  this  is the negated option name documented. You can
          thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter again.

          Example:
           curl --no-progress-meter -o store https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent. Added in 7.67.0.

   --no-sessionid
          (TLS) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching.  By  default
          all  transfers are done using the cache. Note that while nothing
          should ever get hurt by attempting  to  reuse  SSL  session-IDs,
          there seem to be broken SSL implementations in the wild that may
          require you to disable this in order for you to succeed.

          Note that this is the negated option name  documented.  You  can
          thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.

          Example:
           curl --no-sessionid https://example.com

          Added in 7.16.0.

   --noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt;
          Comma-separated  list  of hosts for which not to use a proxy, if
          one is specified. The only wildcard is  a  single  *  character,
          which  matches  all  hosts,  and effectively disables the proxy.
          Each name in this list is matched as either a domain which  con-
          tains  the  hostname,  or  the hostname itself. For example, lo-
          cal.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and  www.local.com,
          but not www.notlocal.com.

          Since  7.53.0,  This  option overrides the environment variables
          that disable the proxy ('no_proxy' and 'NO_PROXY').  If  there's
          an  environment  variable disabling a proxy, you can set the no-
          proxy list to &quot;&quot; to override it.

          Example:
           curl --noproxy &quot;www.example&quot; https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.4.

   --ntlm-wb
          (HTTP) Enables NTLM much in the style --ntlm does, but hand over
          the  authentication  to the separate binary ntlmauth application
          that is executed when needed.

          Example:
           curl --ntlm-wb -u user:password https://example.com

          See also --ntlm and --proxy-ntlm.

   --ntlm (HTTP) Enables  NTLM  authentication.  The  NTLM  authentication
          method was designed by Microsoft and is used by IIS web servers.
          It is a proprietary protocol, reverse-engineered by clever  peo-
          ple and implemented in curl based on their efforts. This kind of
          behavior should not be endorsed, you should  encourage  everyone
          who  uses  NTLM to switch to a public and documented authentica-
          tion method instead, such as Digest.

          If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy  authentication,  then
          use --proxy-ntlm.

          If  this  option  is  used  several times, only the first one is
          used.

          Example:
           curl --ntlm -u user:password https://example.com

          See also  --proxy-ntlm.  --ntlm  requires  that  the  underlying
          libcurl  was built to support TLS. This option overrides --basic
          and --negotiate and --digest and --anyauth.

   --oauth2-bearer &lt;token&gt;
          (IMAP POP3 SMTP HTTP) Specify the Bearer  Token  for  OAUTH  2.0
          server  authentication.  The Bearer Token is used in conjunction
          with the user name which can be specified as part of  the  --url
          or -u, --user options.

          The  Bearer  Token  and user name are formatted according to RFC
          6750.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --oauth2-bearer &quot;mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM&quot; https://example.com

   --output-dir &lt;dir&gt;

          This option specifies the directory in  which  files  should  be
          stored, when -O, --remote-name or -o, --output are used.

          The  given  output directory is used for all URLs and output op-
          tions on the command line, up until the first -:, --next.

          If the specified target directory doesn't exist,  the  operation
          will fail unless --create-dirs is also used.

          If this option is used multiple times, the last specified direc-
          tory will be used.

          Example:
           curl --output-dir &quot;tmp&quot; -O https://example.com

          See also -O, --remote-name and -J,  --remote-header-name.  Added
          in 7.73.0.

   -o, --output &lt;file&gt;
          Write output to &lt;file&gt; instead of stdout. If you are using {} or
          [] to fetch multiple documents, you should quote the URL and you
          can  use  '#' followed by a number in the &lt;file&gt; specifier. That
          variable will be replaced with the current string  for  the  URL
          being fetched. Like in:

           curl &quot;http://{one,two}.example.com&quot; -o &quot;file_#1.txt&quot;

          or use several variables like:

           curl &quot;http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com&quot; -o &quot;#1_#2&quot;

          You  may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you
          have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the  same  command
          line, you can use it like this:

            curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net

          and  the  order  of  the -o options and the URLs doesn't matter,
          just that the first -o is for the first URL and so  on,  so  the
          above command line can also be written as

            curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb

          See  also  the --create-dirs option to create the local directo-
          ries dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a  single  dash)
          will force the output to be done to stdout.

          To   suppress  response  bodies,  you  can  redirect  output  to
          /dev/null:

            curl example.com -o /dev/null

          Or for Windows use nul:
            curl example.com -o nul

          Examples:
           curl -o file https://example.com
           curl &quot;http://{one,two}.example.com&quot; -o &quot;file_#1.txt&quot;
           curl &quot;http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com&quot; -o &quot;#1_#2&quot;
           curl -o file https://example.com -o file2 https://example.net

          See also -O, --remote-name, --remote-name-all and -J,  --remote-
          header-name.

   --parallel-immediate
          When  doing  parallel  transfers, this option will instruct curl
          that it should rather prefer opening up more connections in par-
          allel at once rather than waiting to see if new transfers can be
          added as multiplexed streams on another connection.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --parallel-immediate -Z https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

          See also -Z, --parallel and --parallel-max. Added in 7.68.0.

   --parallel-max &lt;num&gt;
          When  asked to do parallel transfers, using -Z, --parallel, this
          option controls the maximum amount of transfers to do simultane-
          ously.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.
          The default is 50.

          Example:
           curl --parallel-max 100 -Z https://example.com ftp://example.com/

          See also -Z, --parallel. Added in 7.66.0.

   -Z, --parallel
          Makes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared to  the
          regular serial manner.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --parallel https://example.com -o file1 https://example.com -o file2

          Added in 7.66.0.

   --pass &lt;phrase&gt;
          (SSH TLS) Passphrase for the private key.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --pass secret --key file https://example.com

   --path-as-is
          Tell curl to not handle sequences of /../ or /./  in  the  given
          URL  path.  Normally curl will squash or merge them according to
          standards but with this option set you tell it not to do that.

          Example:
           curl --path-as-is https://example.com/../../etc/passwd

          Added in 7.42.0.

   --pinnedpubkey &lt;hashes&gt;
          (TLS) Tells curl to  use  the  specified  public  key  file  (or
          hashes)  to  verify the peer. This can be a path to a file which
          contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
          of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
          rated by ';'

          When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection,  the  server  sends  a
          certificate  indicating  its identity. A public key is extracted
          from this certificate and if it does not exactly match the  pub-
          lic  key provided to this option, curl will abort the connection
          before sending or receiving any data.

          PEM/DER support:

          7.39.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS and GSKit

          7.43.0: NSS and wolfSSL

          7.47.0: mbedtls
          sha256 support:

          7.44.0: OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS and wolfSSL

          7.47.0: mbedtls

          Other SSL backends not supported.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
           curl --pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

   --post301
          (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.2 and not convert POST
          requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection. The
          non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
          conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
          may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
          This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

          Example:
           curl --post301 --location -d &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See  also  --post302,  --post303  and  -L,  --location. Added in
          7.17.1.

   --post302
          (HTTP) Tells curl to respect RFC 7231/6.4.3 and not convert POST
          requests into GET requests when following a 302 redirection. The
          non-RFC behavior is ubiquitous in web browsers, so curl does the
          conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server
          may require a POST to remain a POST after  such  a  redirection.
          This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

          Example:
           curl --post302 --location -d &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See  also  --post301,  --post303  and  -L,  --location. Added in
          7.19.1.

   --post303
          (HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST
          requests  into  GET  requests when following 303 redirections. A
          server may require a POST to remain a POST after a 303 redirect-
          ion. This option is meaningful only when using -L, --location.

          Example:
           curl --post303 --location -d &quot;data&quot; https://example.com

          See  also  --post302,  --post301  and  -L,  --location. Added in
          7.26.0.

   --preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]
          Use the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to  an  HTTP  or
          HTTPS  -x,  --proxy.  In  such a case curl first connects to the
          SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS)  to  the  HTTP  or
          HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.

          The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol:// pre-
          fix to  specify  alternative  proxy  protocols.  Use  socks4://,
          socks4a://,  socks5://  or  socks5h://  to  request the specific
          SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified will  make  curl
          default to SOCKS4.

          If  the  port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
          assumed to be 1080.

          User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
          URL  decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special charac-
          ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x http://http.example https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   -#, --progress-bar
          Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar in-
          stead of the standard, more informational, meter.

          This  progress  bar draws a single line of '#' characters across
          the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known.
          For  transfers  without  a  known size, there will be space ship
          (-=o=-) that moves back and forth but only while data  is  being
          transferred, with a set of flying hash sign symbols on top.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl -# -O https://example.com

   --proto-default &lt;protocol&gt;
          Tells curl to use protocol for any URL missing a scheme name.

          An unknown or unsupported  protocol  causes  error  CURLE_UNSUP-
          PORTED_PROTOCOL (1).

          This option does not change the default proxy protocol (http).

          Without this option set, curl guesses protocol based on the host
          name, see --url for details.

          Example:
           curl --proto-default https ftp.example.com

          Added in 7.45.0.

   --proto-redir &lt;protocols&gt;
          Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect.  Pro-
          tocols  denied by --proto are not overridden by this option. See
          --proto for how protocols are represented.

          Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:

           curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com

          By default curl will allow HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS on redirect
          (7.65.2).  Older versions of curl allowed all protocols on redi-
          rect except several disabled for security reasons: Since  7.19.4
          FILE  and  SCP  are  disabled, and since 7.40.0 SMB and SMBS are
          also disabled. Specifying all or +all enables all  protocols  on
          redirect, including those disabled for security.

          Example:
           curl --proto-redir =http,https https://example.com

          Added in 7.20.2.

   --proto &lt;protocols&gt;
          Tells  curl  to  limit  what protocols it may use for transfers.
          Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma separated,  and
          are  each  a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed by zero
          or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:

          +  Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permit-
             ted (this is the default if no modifier is used).

          -  Deny  this  protocol,  removing it from the list of protocols
             already permitted.

          =  Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already  permit-
             ted),  though subject to later modification by subsequent en-
             tries in the comma separated list.

          For example:

          --proto -ftps  uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

          --proto -all,https,+http
                         only enables http and https

          --proto =http,https
                         also only enables http and https

          Unknown protocols produce a  warning.  This  allows  scripts  to
          safely  rely on being able to disable potentially dangerous pro-
          tocols, without relying upon support  for  that  protocol  being
          built into curl to avoid an error.

          This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect
          is the same as concatenating the protocols into one instance  of
          the option.

          Example:
           curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com

          See also --proto-redir and --proto-default. Added in 7.20.2.

   --proxy-anyauth
          Tells  curl to pick a suitable authentication method when commu-
          nicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might  cause  an  extra
          request/response round-trip.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-basic and --proxy-digest. Added in
          7.13.2.

   --proxy-basic
          Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication  when  communicating
          with the given proxy. Use --basic for enabling HTTP Basic with a
          remote host. Basic is the  default  authentication  method  curl
          uses with proxies.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-digest.

   --proxy-cacert &lt;file&gt;
          Same as --cacert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-cacert CA-file.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

          See  also  --proxy-capath,  --cacert,  --capath and -x, --proxy.
          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-capath &lt;dir&gt;
          Same as --capath but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-capath /local/directory -x https://proxy https://example.com

          See also --proxy-cacert, -x,  --proxy  and  --capath.  Added  in
          7.52.0.

   --proxy-cert-type &lt;type&gt;
          Same as --cert-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-cert-type PEM --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-cert &lt;cert[:passwd]&gt;
          Same as -E, --cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-cert file -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-ciphers &lt;list&gt;
          Same as --ciphers but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8 -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-crlfile &lt;file&gt;
          Same as --crlfile but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-crlfile rejects.txt -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-digest
          Tells  curl to use HTTP Digest authentication when communicating
          with the given proxy. Use --digest for enabling HTTP Digest with
          a remote host.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-digest --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy, --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic.

   --proxy-header &lt;header/@file&gt;
          (HTTP)  Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP
          to a proxy. You may specify any number of extra headers. This is
          the  equivalent option to -H, --header but is for proxy communi-
          cation only like in CONNECT requests when you  want  a  separate
          header  sent  to  the proxy to what is sent to the actual remote
          host.

          curl will make sure that each header  you  add/replace  is  sent
          with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus not add that
          as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
          returns, they will only mess things up for you.

          Headers  specified  with this option will not be included in re-
          quests that curl knows will not be sent to a proxy.

          Starting in 7.55.0, this option can take an argument  in  @file-
          name  style, which then adds a header for each line in the input
          file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.

          This option can be used  multiple  times  to  add/replace/remove
          multiple headers.

          Examples:
           curl --proxy-header &quot;X-First-Name: Joe&quot; -x http://proxy https://example.com
           curl --proxy-header &quot;User-Agent: surprise&quot; -x http://proxy https://example.com
           curl --proxy-header &quot;Host:&quot; -x http://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.37.0.
   --proxy-insecure
          Same as -k, --insecure but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-insecure -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-key-type &lt;type&gt;
          Same as --key-type but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-key-type DER --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-key &lt;key&gt;
          Same as --key but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

   --proxy-negotiate
          Tells  curl  to  use HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication when
          communicating with the given proxy. Use --negotiate for enabling
          HTTP Negotiate (SPNEGO) with a remote host.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-negotiate --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxy https://example.com

          See also --proxy-anyauth and --proxy-basic. Added in 7.17.1.

   --proxy-ntlm
          Tells  curl  to  use HTTP NTLM authentication when communicating
          with the given proxy. Use --ntlm for enabling NTLM with a remote
          host.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ntlm --proxy-user user:passwd -x http://proxy https://example.com

          See also --proxy-negotiate and --proxy-anyauth.

   --proxy-pass &lt;phrase&gt;
          Same as --pass but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-pass secret --proxy-key here -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-pinnedpubkey &lt;hashes&gt;
          (TLS)  Tells  curl  to  use  the  specified  public key file (or
          hashes) to verify the proxy. This can be a path to a file  which
          contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any number
          of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by 'sha256//' and sepa-
          rated by ';'

          When  negotiating  a  TLS  or SSL connection, the server sends a
          certificate indicating its identity. A public key  is  extracted
          from  this certificate and if it does not exactly match the pub-
          lic key provided to this option, curl will abort the  connection
          before sending or receiving any data.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey keyfile https://example.com
           curl --proxy-pinnedpubkey 'sha256//ce118b51897f4452dc' https://example.com

   --proxy-service-name &lt;name&gt;
          This  option allows you to change the service name for proxy ne-
          gotiation.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-service-name &quot;shrubbery&quot; -x proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.43.0.

   --proxy-ssl-allow-beast
          Same as --ssl-allow-beast but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ssl-allow-beast -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert
          Same as --ssl-auto-client-cert but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.77.0.

   --proxy-tls13-ciphers &lt;ciphersuite list&gt;
          (TLS) Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection  to
          your HTTPS proxy when it negotiates TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers
          suites must specify valid ciphers. Read up  on  TLS  1.3  cipher
          suite details on this URL:

           https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

          This  option  is  currently  used only when curl is built to use
          OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
          you  can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the --proxy-
          ciphers option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -x proxy https://example.com

   --proxy-tlsauthtype &lt;type&gt;
          Same as --tlsauthtype but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlsauthtype SRP -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-tlspassword &lt;string&gt;
          Same as --tlspassword but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlspassword passwd -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-tlsuser &lt;name&gt;
          Same as --tlsuser but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlsuser smith -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --proxy-tlsv1
          Same as -1, --tlsv1 but used in HTTPS proxy context.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-tlsv1 -x https://proxy https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   -U, --proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;
          Specify the user name and password to use for proxy  authentica-
          tion.

          If  you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either Ne-
          gotiate or NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to  select
          the user name and password from your environment by specifying a
          single colon with this option: &quot;-U :&quot;.

          On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
          ment  from  process listings. This is not enough to protect cre-
          dentials from possibly getting seen by other users on  the  same
          system  as  they will still be visible for a brief moment before
          cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
          stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.
          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --proxy-user name:pwd -x proxy https://example.com

   -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]
          Use the specified proxy.

          The  proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No
          protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use
          socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a spe-
          cific SOCKS version to be used.  (The protocol support was added
          in curl 7.21.7)

          HTTPS  proxy  support  via https:// protocol prefix was added in
          7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.

          Unrecognized and unsupported  proxy  protocols  cause  an  error
          since  7.52.0.   Prior  versions may ignore the protocol and use
          http:// instead.

          If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,  it  is
          assumed to be 1080.

          This  option  overrides  existing environment variables that set
          the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable  setting  a
          proxy, you can set proxy to &quot;&quot; to override it.

          All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will trans-
          parently be converted to HTTP. It means  that  certain  protocol
          specific operations might not be available. This is not the case
          if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p, --prox-
          ytunnel option.

          User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are
          URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special  charac-
          ters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.

          The  proxy host can be specified the exact same way as the proxy
          environment variables, including the protocol  prefix  (http://)
          and the embedded user + password.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --proxy http://proxy.example https://example.com

   --proxy1.0 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use  the  specified  HTTP  1.0  proxy. If the port number is not
          specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

          The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy  option  -x,
          --proxy,  is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy will
          specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.

          Example:
           curl --proxy1.0 -x http://proxy https://example.com

   -p, --proxytunnel
          When an HTTP proxy is used -x, --proxy, this  option  will  make
          curl  tunnel through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made with
          the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the  proxy  al-
          lows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants to tun-
          nel through to.

          To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is  set  to
          output headers use --suppress-connect-headers.

          Example:
           curl --proxytunnel -x http://proxy https://example.com

          See also -x, --proxy.

   --pubkey &lt;key&gt;
          (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your pub-
          lic key in this separate file.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          (As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the public
          key  from the private key file, so passing this option is gener-
          ally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires
          libcurl  to  be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8 or higher
          that is itself linked against OpenSSL.)

          Example:
           curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/

   -Q, --quote &lt;command&gt;
          (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP  or  SFTP
          server.  Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place
          (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP  transfer,  to  be
          exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,
          prefix them with a dash '-'.  To make  commands  be  sent  after
          curl has changed the working directory, just before the transfer
          command(s), prefix the command with a '+'  (this  is  only  sup-
          ported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands.

          By  default  curl  will stop at first failure. To make curl con-
          tinue even if the command fails, prefix the command with an  as-
          terisk  (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of
          the commands, the entire operation will be aborted.

          You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959  de-
          fines  to  FTP  servers,  or one of the commands listed below to
          SFTP servers.

          This option can be used multiple times.

          SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets  SFTP
          quote  commands  itself before sending them to the server.  File
          names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special char-
          acters.   Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote com-
          mands:

          atime date file
                 The atime command sets the last access time of  the  file
                 named  by  the file operand. The &lt;date expression&gt; can be
                 all sorts of date strings, see  the  curl_getdate(3)  man
                 page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

          chgrp group file
                 The  chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by
                 the file operand to the group ID specified by  the  group
                 operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.

          chmod mode file
                 The  chmod  command  modifies  the  file mode bits of the
                 specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode
                 number.

          chown user file
                 The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the
                 file operand to the user ID specified by the  user  oper-
                 and. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.

          ln source_file target_file
                 The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the
                 target_file location pointing to  the  source_file  loca-
                 tion.

          mkdir directory_name
                 The  mkdir command creates the directory named by the di-
                 rectory_name operand.

          mtime date file
                 The mtime command sets the last modification time of  the
                 file named by the file operand. The &lt;date expression&gt; can
                 be all sorts of date strings, see the curl_getdate(3) man
                 page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)

          pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute pathname of the cur-
                 rent working directory.

          rename source target
                 The rename command renames the file or directory named by
                 the  source  operand to the destination path named by the
                 target operand.

          rm file
                 The rm command removes the file specified by the file op-
                 erand.

          rmdir directory
                 The  rmdir  command removes the directory entry specified
                 by the directory operand, provided it is empty.

          symlink source_file target_file
                 See ln.

   Example:
    curl --quote &quot;DELE file&quot; ftp://example.com/foo

   --random-file &lt;file&gt;
          Specify the path name to file containing what will be considered
          as  random  data. The data may be used to seed the random engine
          for SSL connections.  See also the --egd-file option.

          Example:
           curl --random-file rubbish https://example.com

   -r, --range &lt;range&gt;
          (HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial docu-
          ment)  from  an  HTTP/1.1,  FTP  or SFTP server or a local FILE.
          Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.

          0-499     specifies the first 500 bytes

          500-999   specifies the second 500 bytes

          -500      specifies the last 500 bytes

          9500-     specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward

          0-0,-1    specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)

          100-199,500-599
                    specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)

          (*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a  mul-
          tipart  response,  which will be returned as-is by curl! Parsing
          or otherwise transforming this response is the responsibility of
          the caller.

          Only  digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and 'stop'
          fields of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a non-digit  charac-
          ter is given in the range, the server's response will be unspec-
          ified, depending on the server's configuration.

          You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not  have
          this  feature  enabled, so that when you attempt to get a range,
          you'll instead get the whole document.

          FTP and SFTP range downloads only  support  the  simple  'start-
          stop'  syntax  (optionally with one of the numbers omitted). FTP
          use depends on the extended FTP command SIZE.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --range 22-44 https://example.com

   --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding of con-
          tent  or transfer encodings and instead makes them passed on un-
          altered, raw.

          Example:
           curl --raw https://example.com

          Added in 7.16.2.

   -e, --referer &lt;URL&gt;
          (HTTP) Sends the &quot;Referrer Page&quot; information to the HTTP server.
          This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.  When
          used with -L, --location you  can  append  &quot;;auto&quot;  to  the  -e,
          --referer  URL  to  make curl automatically set the previous URL
          when it follows a Location: header. The &quot;;auto&quot;  string  can  be
          used alone, even if you don't set an initial -e, --referer.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl --referer &quot;https://fake.example&quot; https://example.com
           curl --referer &quot;https://fake.example;auto&quot; -L https://example.com
           curl --referer &quot;;auto&quot; -L https://example.com

          See also -A, --user-agent and -H, --header.

   -J, --remote-header-name
          (HTTP) This option tells the -O, --remote-name option to use the
          server-specified Content-Disposition  filename  instead  of  ex-
          tracting a filename from the URL.

          If  the  server  specifies a file name and a file with that name
          already exists in the current working directory it will  not  be
          overwritten and an error will occur. If the server doesn't spec-
          ify a file name then this option has no effect.

          There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in  the  provided
          file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected
          file names.

          WARNING: Exercise judicious use of this  option,  especially  on
          Windows.  A  rogue  server  could  send you the name of a DLL or
          other file that could possibly be loaded automatically  by  Win-
          dows or some third party software.

          Example:
           curl -OJ https://example.com/file

   --remote-name-all
          This  option changes the default action for all given URLs to be
          dealt with as if -O, --remote-name were used for each one. So if
          you want to disable that for a specific URL after --remote-name-
          all has been used, you must use &quot;-o -&quot; or --no-remote-name.

          Example:
           curl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2

          Added in 7.19.0.

   -O, --remote-name
          Write output to a local file named like the remote file we  get.
          (Only  the file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut
          off.)

          The file will be saved in the current working directory. If  you
          want  the  file  saved  in  a different directory, make sure you
          change the current working directory before invoking  curl  with
          this option.

          The  remote  file  name  to use for saving is extracted from the
          given URL, nothing else, and if it already  exists  it  will  be
          overwritten.  If  you  want  the server to be able to choose the
          file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in
          addition  to  this option. If the server chooses a file name and
          that name already exists it will not be overwritten.

          There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20 or
          other  URL  encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as
          file name.

          You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs  you
          have.

          Example:
           curl -O https://example.com/filename

   -R, --remote-time
          When  used,  this will make curl attempt to figure out the time-
          stamp of the remote file, and if that is available make the  lo-
          cal file get that same timestamp.

          Example:
           curl --remote-time -o foo https://example.com

   --request-target &lt;path&gt;
          (HTTP)  Tells curl to use an alternative &quot;target&quot; (path) instead
          of using the path as provided in the  URL.  Particularly  useful
          when  wanting  to  issue  HTTP requests without leading slash or
          other data that doesn't follow the  regular  URL  pattern,  like
          &quot;OPTIONS *&quot;.

          Example:
           curl --request-target &quot;*&quot; -X OPTIONS https://example.com

          Added in 7.55.0.

   -X, --request &lt;command&gt;
          (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicat-
          ing with the HTTP server.  The specified request method will  be
          used  instead  of  the  method otherwise used (which defaults to
          GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification for details  and  explana-
          tions.  Common  additional HTTP requests include PUT and DELETE,
          but related technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE
          and more.

          Normally  you  don't  need  this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD,
          POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated com-
          mand line options.

          This  option  only  changes the actual word used in the HTTP re-
          quest, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if
          you  want  to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will not
          suffice. You need to use the -I, --head option.

          The method string you set with -X, --request will  be  used  for
          all  requests,  which  if you for example use -L, --location may
          cause unintended side-effects when curl doesn't  change  request
          method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.

          (FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST when
          doing file lists with FTP.

          (POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or
          RETR. (Added in 7.26.0)

          (IMAP)  Specifies  a custom IMAP command to use instead of LIST.
          (Added in 7.30.0)

          (SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP or
          VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -X &quot;DELETE&quot; https://example.com
           curl -X NLST ftp://example.com/

   --resolve &lt;[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...&gt;
          Provide  a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Us-
          ing this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified  ad-
          dress  and prevent the otherwise normally resolved address to be
          used. Consider it a sort of /etc/hosts alternative  provided  on
          the  command line. The port number should be the number used for
          the specific protocol the host will be used for.  It  means  you
          need several entries if you want to provide address for the same
          host but different ports.

          By specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any  host
          and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is re-
          solved last so any --resolve with a specific host and port  will
          be used first.

          The provided address set by this option will be used even if -4,
          --ipv4 or -6, --ipv6 is set to make curl use another IP version.
          By prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry time out
          after  curl's  default  timeout  (1 minute). Note that this will
          only make sense for long running parallel transfers with  a  lot
          of files. In such cases, if this option is used curl will try to
          resolve the host as it normally would once the timeout  has  ex-
          pired.

          Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was added
          in 7.57.0.

          Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was  added
          in 7.59.0.

          Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.

          Support for the '+' prefix was was added in 7.75.0.

          This option can be used many times to add many host names to re-
          solve.

          Example:
           curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.3.

   --retry-all-errors
          Retry on any error. This option is used together with --retry.

          This option is the &quot;sledgehammer&quot; of retrying. Do not  use  this
          option by default (eg in curlrc), there may be unintended conse-
          quences such as sending or receiving duplicate data. Do not  use
          with  redirected  input or output. You'd be much better off han-
          dling your unique problems in shell script. Please read the  ex-
          ample below.

          WARNING:  For server compatibility curl attempts to retry failed
          flaky transfers as close as possible to how they  were  started,
          but  this  is  not possible with redirected input or output. For
          example, before retrying it removes output data  from  a  failed
          partial  transfer  that  was  written to an output file. However
          this is not true of data redirected to a | pipe or &gt; file, which
          are  not reset. We strongly suggest don't parse or record output
          via redirect in combination with this option, since you may  re-
          ceive duplicate data.

          By default curl will not error on an HTTP response code that in-
          dicates an HTTP error, if the transfer was successful. For exam-
          ple,  if  a  server replies 404 Not Found and the reply is fully
          received then that is not an error. When --retry  is  used  then
          curl  will retry on some HTTP response codes that indicate tran-
          sient HTTP errors, but that does not include most  4xx  response
          codes  such  as  404. If you want to retry on all response codes
          that indicate HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) then  combine  with  -f,
          --fail.

          Example:
           curl --retry-all-errors https://example.com

          Added in 7.71.0.

   --retry-connrefused
          In  addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as a
          transient error too for --retry. This option  is  used  together
          with --retry.

          Example:
           curl --retry-connrefused --retry https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   --retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt;
          Make  curl  sleep  this  amount of time before each retry when a
          transfer has failed with a transient error (it changes  the  de-
          fault  backoff  time  algorithm between retries). This option is
          only interesting if --retry is also used. Setting this delay  to
          zero will make curl use the default backoff time.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --retry-delay 5 --retry https://example.com

          Added in 7.12.3.

   --retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
          The  retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Re-
          tries will be done as usual (see --retry) as long as  the  timer
          hasn't reached this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't
          reached the limit, the request will be made and  while  perform-
          ing,  it may take longer than this given time period. To limit a
          single request's maximum time, use -m, --max-time.  Set this op-
          tion to zero to not timeout retries.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --retry-max-time 30 --retry 10 https://example.com

          Added in 7.12.3.

   --retry &lt;num&gt;
          If  a  transient  error is returned when curl tries to perform a
          transfer, it will retry this number of times before  giving  up.
          Setting  the  number to 0 makes curl do no retries (which is the
          default). Transient error means either: a timeout,  an  FTP  4xx
          response code or an HTTP 408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response
          code.

          When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first  wait  one
          second  and  then for all forthcoming retries it will double the
          waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be  the
          delay  between  the rest of the retries.  By using --retry-delay
          you  disable  this  exponential  backoff  algorithm.  See   also
          --retry-max-time to limit the total time allowed for retries.

          Since  curl  7.66.0,  curl will comply with the Retry-After: re-
          sponse header if one was present to know when to issue the  next
          retry.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --retry 7 https://example.com

          Added in 7.12.3.

   --sasl-authzid &lt;identity&gt;
          Use this authorisation identity (authzid), during SASL PLAIN au-
          thentication, in addition to the authentication identity  (auth-
          cid) as specified by -u, --user.

          If  the  option  isn't specified, the server will derive the au-
          thzid from the authcid, but if specified, and depending  on  the
          server  implementation,  it may be used to access another user's
          inbox, that the user has been granted access  to,  or  a  shared
          mailbox for example.

          Example:
           curl --sasl-authzid zid imap://example.com/

          Added in 7.66.0.

   --sasl-ir
          Enable initial response in SASL authentication.

          Example:
           curl --sasl-ir imap://example.com/

          Added in 7.31.0.

   --service-name &lt;name&gt;
          This option allows you to change the service name for SPNEGO.

          Examples:    --negotiate    --service-name   sockd   would   use
          sockd/server-name.

          Example:
           curl --service-name sockd/server https://example.com

          Added in 7.43.0.
   -S, --show-error
          When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message
          if it fails.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --show-error --silent https://example.com

          See also --no-progress-meter.

   -s, --silent
          Silent or quiet mode. Don't show progress meter  or  error  mes-
          sages.   Makes  Curl mute. It will still output the data you ask
          for, potentially even to the terminal/stdout unless you redirect
          it.

          Use  -S,  --show-error  in  addition  to  this option to disable
          progress meter but still show error messages.

          Example:
           curl -s https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose, --stderr and --no-progress-meter.

   --socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not speci-
          fied,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. Using this socket type make
          curl resolve the host name and passing the  address  on  to  the
          proxy.

          This  option  overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy, as they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks4 proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks4:// protocol prefix.
          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --socks4 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.15.2.

   --socks4a &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not spec-
          ified,  it  is  assumed at port 1080. This asks the proxy to re-
          solve the host name.

          This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks4a proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks4a:// protocol  pre-
          fix.

          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --socks4a hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   --socks5-basic
          Tells curl to use username/password authentication when connect-
          ing  to a SOCKS5 proxy.  The username/password authentication is
          enabled by default.  Use --socks5-gssapi to  force  GSS-API  au-
          thentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-basic --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.55.0.

   --socks5-gssapi-nec
          As  part of the GSS-API negotiation a protection mode is negoti-
          ated. RFC 1961 says in section 4.3/4.4 it should  be  protected,
          but  the  NEC  reference  implementation  does  not.  The option
          --socks5-gssapi-nec allows the unprotected exchange of the  pro-
          tection mode negotiation.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-gssapi-nec --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.4.

   --socks5-gssapi-service &lt;name&gt;
          The default service name for a socks server is rcmd/server-fqdn.
          This option allows you to change it.

          Examples:  --socks5  proxy-name  --socks5-gssapi-service   sockd
          would  use sockd/proxy-name --socks5 proxy-name --socks5-gssapi-
          service sockd/real-name  would  use  sockd/real-name  for  cases
          where the proxy-name does not match the principal name.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-gssapi-service sockd --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.19.4.

   --socks5-gssapi
          Tells  curl  to  use GSS-API authentication when connecting to a
          SOCKS5 proxy.  The GSS-API authentication is enabled by  default
          (if  curl is compiled with GSS-API support).  Use --socks5-basic
          to force username/password authentication to SOCKS5 proxies.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-gssapi --socks5 hostname:4096 https://example.com

          Added in 7.55.0.

   --socks5-hostname &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy (and let the  proxy  resolve  the
          host  name).  If the port number is not specified, it is assumed
          at port 1080.

          This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks5 hostname proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks5h:// proto-
          col prefix.

          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the same time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS  proxy.  In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --socks5-hostname proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   --socks5 &lt;host[:port]&gt;
          Use the specified SOCKS5 proxy - but resolve the host  name  lo-
          cally.  If  the  port  number is not specified, it is assumed at
          port 1080.

          This option overrides any previous use of -x, --proxy,  as  they
          are mutually exclusive.

          Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a
          socks5 proxy with -x, --proxy using a socks5:// protocol prefix.
          Since 7.52.0, --preproxy can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at
          the  same  time -x, --proxy is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In
          such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then con-
          nects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.
          This  option (as well as --socks4) does not work with IPV6, FTPS
          or LDAP.
          Example:
           curl --socks5 proxy.example:7000 https://example.com

          Added in 7.18.0.

   -Y, --speed-limit &lt;speed&gt;
          If a download is slower than this given speed (in bytes per sec-
          ond)  for  speed-time seconds it gets aborted. speed-time is set
          with -y, --speed-time and is 30 if not set.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

   -y, --speed-time &lt;seconds&gt;
          If a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per second during
          a speed-time period, the download gets aborted. If speed-time is
          used, the default speed-limit will be  1  unless  set  with  -Y,
          --speed-limit.

          This  option  controls  transfers  and thus will not affect slow
          connects etc. If this is a concern for you, try  the  --connect-
          timeout option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --speed-limit 300 --speed-time 10 https://example.com

   --ssl-allow-beast
          This option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
          SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols known as BEAST.  If this option  isn't
          used,  the SSL layer may use workarounds known to cause interop-
          erability problems with some older SSL implementations.

          WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and by using this
          flag you ask for exactly that.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-allow-beast https://example.com

          Added in 7.25.0.

   --ssl-auto-client-cert
          Tell  libcurl  to automatically locate and use a client certifi-
          cate for authentication, when requested by the server. This  op-
          tion  is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL li-
          brary). Prior to 7.77.0 this was the default behavior in libcurl
          with Schannel. Since the server can request any certificate that
          supports client authentication in the OS  certificate  store  it
          could be a privacy violation and unexpected.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-auto-client-cert https://example.com

          See also --proxy-ssl-auto-client-cert. Added in 7.77.0.

   --ssl-no-revoke
          (Schannel) This option tells curl to disable certificate revoca-
          tion checks.  WARNING: this option loosens the SSL security, and
          by using this flag you ask for exactly that.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-no-revoke https://example.com

          Added in 7.44.0.

   --ssl-reqd
          (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP) Require SSL/TLS for the connection.  Termi-
          nates the connection if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.

          This option was formerly known as --ftp-ssl-reqd.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-reqd ftp://example.com

          Added in 7.20.0.

   --ssl-revoke-best-effort
          (Schannel) This option tells curl to ignore certificate  revoca-
          tion checks when they failed due to missing/offline distribution
          points for the revocation check lists.

          Example:
           curl --ssl-revoke-best-effort https://example.com

          Added in 7.70.0.

   --ssl  (FTP IMAP POP3 SMTP) Try to use SSL/TLS for the connection.  Re-
          verts  to  a non-secure connection if the server doesn't support
          SSL/TLS.  See also --ftp-ssl-control and --ssl-reqd for  differ-
          ent levels of encryption required.

          This  option  was formerly known as --ftp-ssl (Added in 7.11.0).
          That option name can still be used but will be removed in a  fu-
          ture version.

          Example:
           curl --ssl pop3://example.com/

          Added in 7.20.0.

   -2, --sslv2
          (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv2, but start-
          ing in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv2 is  widely
          considered insecure (see RFC 6176).

          Example:
           curl --sslv2 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -2, --sslv2 requires that the
          underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This  option  over-
          rides -3, --sslv3 and -1, --tlsv1 and --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2.

   -3, --sslv3
          (SSL) This option previously asked curl to use SSLv3, but start-
          ing in curl 7.77.0 this instruction is ignored. SSLv3 is  widely
          considered insecure (see RFC 7568).

          Example:
           curl --sslv3 https://example.com

          See  also  --http1.1  and --http2. -3, --sslv3 requires that the
          underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. This  option  over-
          rides -2, --sslv2 and -1, --tlsv1 and --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2.

   --stderr &lt;file&gt;
          Redirect  all writes to stderr to the specified file instead. If
          the file name is a plain '-', it is instead written to stdout.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --stderr output.txt https://example.com

          See also -v, --verbose and -s, --silent.

   --styled-output
          Enables  the automatic use of bold font styles when writing HTTP
          headers to the terminal. Use --no-styled-output to  switch  them
          off.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --styled-output -I https://example.com

          Added in 7.61.0.

   --suppress-connect-headers
          When -p, --proxytunnel is used and a  CONNECT  request  is  made
          don't  output  proxy  CONNECT  response  headers. This option is
          meant to be used with -D, --dump-header or -i,  --include  which
          are  used  to show protocol headers in the output. It has no ef-
          fect on debug options such as -v, --verbose or --trace,  or  any
          statistics.

          Example:
           curl --suppress-connect-headers --include -x proxy https://example.com

          See also -D, --dump-header, -i, --include and -p, --proxytunnel.

   --tcp-fastopen
          Enable use of TCP Fast Open (RFC7413).

          Example:
           curl --tcp-fastopen https://example.com

          Added in 7.49.0.

   --tcp-nodelay
          Turn  on the TCP_NODELAY option. See the curl_easy_setopt(3) man
          page for details about this option.

          Since 7.50.2, curl sets this option by default and you  need  to
          explicitly switch it off if you don't want it on.

          Example:
           curl --tcp-nodelay https://example.com

          Added in 7.11.2.

   -t, --telnet-option &lt;opt=val&gt;
          Pass options to the telnet protocol. Supported options are:

          TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.

          XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display location.

          NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment variable.

          Example:
           curl -t TTYPE=vt100 telnet://example.com/

   --tftp-blksize &lt;value&gt;
          (TFTP) Set TFTP BLKSIZE option (must be &gt;512). This is the block
          size that curl will try to use when transferring data to or from
          a TFTP server. By default 512 bytes will be used.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --tftp-blksize 1024 tftp://example.com/file

          Added in 7.20.0.

   --tftp-no-options
          (TFTP) Tells curl not to send TFTP options requests.

          This  option  improves  interop with some legacy servers that do
          not acknowledge or properly implement TFTP  options.  When  this
          option is used --tftp-blksize is ignored.

          Example:
           curl --tftp-no-options tftp://192.168.0.1/

          Added in 7.48.0.

   -z, --time-cond &lt;time&gt;
          (HTTP  FTP) Request a file that has been modified later than the
          given time and date, or one that has been modified  before  that
          time.  The &lt;date expression&gt; can be all sorts of date strings or
          if it doesn't match any internal ones, it is taken as a filename
          and  tries  to get the modification date (mtime) from &lt;file&gt; in-
          stead. See the curl_getdate(3) man pages for date expression de-
          tails.

          Start the date expression with a dash (-) to make it request for
          a document that is older than the given date/time, default is  a
          document that is newer than the specified date/time.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Examples:
           curl -z &quot;Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00&quot; https://example.com
           curl -z &quot;-Wed 01 Sep 2021 12:18:00&quot; https://example.com
           curl -z file https://example.com

   --tls-max &lt;VERSION&gt;
          (SSL) VERSION defines maximum supported TLS version. The minimum
          acceptable version  is  set  by  tlsv1.0,  tlsv1.1,  tlsv1.2  or
          tlsv1.3.

          If  the  connection  is done without TLS, this option has no ef-
          fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

          default
                 Use up to recommended TLS version.

          1.0    Use up to TLSv1.0.
          1.1    Use up to TLSv1.1.
          1.2    Use up to TLSv1.2.
          1.3    Use up to TLSv1.3.

   Examples:
    curl --tls-max 1.2 https://example.com
    curl --tls-max 1.3 --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

   See also --tlsv1.0, --tlsv1.1, --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.  --tls-max  re-
   quires  that  the underlying libcurl was built to support TLS. Added in
   7.54.0.

   --tls13-ciphers &lt;ciphersuite list&gt;
          (TLS) Specifies which cipher suites to use in the connection  if
          it  negotiates  TLS 1.3. The list of ciphers suites must specify
          valid ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher suite details  on  this
          URL:

           https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

          This  option  is  currently  used only when curl is built to use
          OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. If you are using a different SSL backend
          you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the --ciphers
          option.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 https://example.com

   --tlsauthtype &lt;type&gt;
          Set TLS authentication type. Currently, the only  supported  op-
          tion  is  &quot;SRP&quot;,  for  TLS-SRP  (RFC  5054).  If  --tlsuser  and
          --tlspassword are specified but --tlsauthtype is not, then  this
          option  defaults to &quot;SRP&quot;.  This option works only if the under-
          lying libcurl is built  with  TLS-SRP  support,  which  requires
          OpenSSL or GnuTLS with TLS-SRP support.

          Example:
           curl --tlsauthtype SRP https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.4.

   --tlspassword &lt;string&gt;
          Set  password  for use with the TLS authentication method speci-
          fied with --tlsauthtype. Requires that --tlsuser also be set.

          This doesn't work with TLS 1.3.

          Example:
           curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.4.
   --tlsuser &lt;name&gt;
          Set username for use with the TLS authentication  method  speci-
          fied  with  --tlsauthtype.  Requires  that --tlspassword also is
          set.

          This doesn't work with TLS 1.3.

          Example:
           curl --tlspassword pwd --tlsuser user https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.4.

   --tlsv1.0
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.0 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
          _only_ TLS 1.0, but behavior was inconsistent depending  on  the
          TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
          sion.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.0 https://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --tlsv1.1
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.1 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
          _only_ TLS 1.1, but behavior was inconsistent depending  on  the
          TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
          sion.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.1 https://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --tlsv1.2
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.2 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          In  old  versions  of  curl  this option was documented to allow
          _only_ TLS 1.2, but behavior was inconsistent depending  on  the
          TLS library. Use --tls-max if you want to set a maximum TLS ver-
          sion.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.2 https://example.com

          Added in 7.34.0.

   --tlsv1.3
          (TLS) Forces curl to use TLS version 1.3 or later when  connect-
          ing to a remote TLS server.

          If  the  connection  is done without TLS, this option has no ef-
          fect. This includes QUIC-using (HTTP/3) transfers.

          Note that TLS 1.3 is not supported by all TLS backends.

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1.3 https://example.com

          Added in 7.52.0.

   -1, --tlsv1
          (SSL) Tells curl to use at least TLS version 1.x when  negotiat-
          ing  with  a  remote  TLS  server. That means TLS version 1.0 or
          higher

          Example:
           curl --tlsv1 https://example.com

          See also --http1.1 and --http2. -1, --tlsv1  requires  that  the
          underlying  libcurl  was built to support TLS. This option over-
          rides --tlsv1.1 and --tlsv1.2 and --tlsv1.3.

   --tr-encoding
          (HTTP) Request a compressed Transfer-Encoding response using one
          of  the  algorithms curl supports, and uncompress the data while
          receiving it.

          Example:
           curl --tr-encoding https://example.com

          Added in 7.21.6.

   --trace-ascii &lt;file&gt;
          Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
          cluding  descriptive  information, to the given output file. Use
          &quot;-&quot; as filename to have the output sent to stdout.

          This is very similar to --trace, but leaves out the hex part and
          only  shows  the ASCII part of the dump. It makes smaller output
          that might be easier to read for untrained humans.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --trace-ascii log.txt https://example.com

          This option overrides --trace and -v, --verbose.

   --trace-time
          Prepends  a  time  stamp to each trace or verbose line that curl
          displays.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Example:
           curl --trace-time --trace-ascii output https://example.com

          Added in 7.14.0.

   --trace &lt;file&gt;
          Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, in-
          cluding descriptive information, to the given output  file.  Use
          &quot;-&quot;  as  filename  to have the output sent to stdout. Use &quot;%&quot; as
          filename to have the output sent to stderr.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl --trace log.txt https://example.com

          This option overrides -v, --verbose and --trace-ascii.

   --unix-socket &lt;path&gt;
          (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using
          the network.

          Example:
           curl --unix-socket socket-path https://example.com

          Added in 7.40.0.

   -T, --upload-file &lt;file&gt;
          This transfers the specified local file to the  remote  URL.  If
          there is no file part in the specified URL, curl will append the
          local file name. NOTE that you must use a trailing / on the last
          directory  to really prove to Curl that there is no file name or
          curl will think that your last directory name is the remote file
          name to use. That will most likely cause the upload operation to
          fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the PUT command will
          be used.

          Use  the file name &quot;-&quot; (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a
          given file.  Alternately, the file name &quot;.&quot;  (a  single  period)
          may  be  specified  instead  of &quot;-&quot; to use stdin in non-blocking
          mode to allow reading server output while  stdin  is  being  up-
          loaded.

          You  can  specify one -T, --upload-file for each URL on the com-
          mand line. Each -T, --upload-file + URL pair specifies  what  to
          upload  and  to  where. curl also supports &quot;globbing&quot; of the -T,
          --upload-file argument, meaning that  you  can  upload  multiple
          files  to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style sup-
          ported in the URL.

          When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data  is  assumed
          to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of
          headers and mail body formatted correctly by the  user  as  curl
          will not transcode nor encode it further in any way.

          Examples:
           curl -T file https://example.com
           curl -T &quot;img[1-1000].png&quot; ftp://ftp.example.com/
           curl --upload-file &quot;{file1,file2}&quot; https://example.com

   --url &lt;url&gt;
          Specify  a  URL  to  fetch. This option is mostly handy when you
          want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

          If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as &quot;http://&quot;  or
          &quot;ftp://&quot;  etc) then curl will make a guess based on the host. If
          the outermost sub-domain name matches  DICT,  FTP,  IMAP,  LDAP,
          POP3  or  SMTP  then  that protocol will be used, otherwise HTTP
          will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
          default protocol, see --proto-default for details.

          This  option  may  be used any number of times. To control where
          this URL is written, use the -o, --output or the  -O,  --remote-
          name options.

          WARNING:  On  Windows,  particular  file:// accesses can be con-
          verted to network accesses by the operating system. Beware!

          Example:
           curl --url https://example.com

   -B, --use-ascii
          (FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be  en-
          forced  by  using  a  URL  that ends with &quot;;type=A&quot;. This option
          causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.

          Example:
           curl -B ftp://example.com/README

   -A, --user-agent &lt;name&gt;
          (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
          To  encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single
          quote marks. This header can also be set with the  -H,  --header
          or the --proxy-header options.

          If  you give an empty argument to -A, --user-agent (&quot;&quot;), it will
          remove the header completely from the request. If you  prefer  a
          blank header, you can set it to a single space (&quot; &quot;).

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl -A &quot;Agent 007&quot; https://example.com

   -u, --user &lt;user:password&gt;
          Specify the user name and password to use for server authentica-
          tion. Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.

          If you simply specify the user name,  curl  will  prompt  for  a
          password.

          The  user  name  and  passwords are split up on the first colon,
          which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user  name  with
          this option. The password can, still.

          On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option argu-
          ment from process listings. This is not enough to  protect  cre-
          dentials  from  possibly getting seen by other users on the same
          system as they will still be visible for a brief  moment  before
          cleared. Such sensitive data should be retrieved from a file in-
          stead or similar and never used in clear text in a command line.
          When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based  server  you  should
          include  the  Windows domain name in the user name, in order for
          the server to successfully obtain  a  Kerberos  Ticket.  If  you
          don't then the initial authentication handshake may fail.

          When  using  NTLM,  the user name can be specified simply as the
          user name, without the domain, if there is a single  domain  and
          forest in your setup for example.

          To  specify  the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or
          UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
          user@example.com respectively.

          If  you  use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform Ker-
          beros V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you  can
          tell  curl  to select the user name and password from your envi-
          ronment by specifying a single colon with this option: &quot;-u :&quot;.

          If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

          Example:
           curl -u user:secret https://example.com

   -v, --verbose
          Makes curl verbose during the operation.  Useful  for  debugging
          and  seeing  what's  going  on &quot;under the hood&quot;. A line starting
          with '&gt;' means &quot;header data&quot; sent by  curl,  '&lt;'  means  &quot;header
          data&quot;  received  by  curl  that is hidden in normal cases, and a
          line starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

          If you only want HTTP headers in the output, -i, --include might
          be the option you're looking for.

          If  you think this option still doesn't give you enough details,
          consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.

          This option is global and does not need to be specified for each
          use of -:, --next.

          Use -s, --silent to make curl really quiet.

          Example:
           curl --verbose https://example.com

          See  also  -i,  --include.  This  option  overrides  --trace and
          --trace-ascii.

   -V, --version
          Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.
          The first line includes the full version of  curl,  libcurl  and
          other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.

          The  second  line (starts with &quot;Protocols:&quot;) shows all protocols
          that libcurl reports to support.

          The third line (starts with &quot;Features:&quot;) shows specific features
          libcurl reports to offer. Available features include:

          alt-svc

                 NTLM delegation to winbind helper is supported.

          PSL    PSL  is  short for Public Suffix List and means that this
                 curl has been built with  knowledge  about  &quot;public  suf-
                 fixes&quot;.

          SPNEGO SPNEGO authentication is supported.

   Example:
    curl --version

   -w, --write-out &lt;format&gt;
          Make curl display information on stdout after a completed trans-
          fer.  The  format  is a string that may contain plain text mixed
          with any number of variables. The format can be specified  as  a
          literal  &quot;string&quot;,  or  you can have curl read the format from a
          file with &quot;@filename&quot; and to tell curl to read the  format  from
          stdin you write &quot;@-&quot;.

          The  variables  present in the output format will be substituted
          by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as  described  below.
          All  variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output a
          normal % you just write them as </code></pre>
. You can output a newline  by
              using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with \t.

              The  output  will be written to standard output, but this can be
              switched to standard error by using %{stderr}.

              NOTE: The %-symbol is a special symbol in the win32-environment,
              where  all  occurrences of % must be doubled when using this op-
              tion.

              The variables available are:

              content_type   The Content-Type of the  requested  document,  if
                             there was any.

              exitcode       The numerical exitcode of the transfer. (Added in
                             7.75.0)

              filename_effective
                             The ultimate filename that curl  writes  out  to.
                             This  is only meaningful if curl is told to write
                             to a file  with  the  -O,  --remote-name  or  -o,
                             --output  option. It's most useful in combination
                             with the -J, --remote-header-name option.  (Added
                             in 7.26.0)

              ftp_entry_path The initial path curl ended up in when logging on

              size_download  The total amount of bytes that  were  downloaded.
                             This is the size of the body/data that was trans-

              stdout         From this point on, the  -w,  --write-out  output
                             will  be written to standard output.  This is the
                             default, but can be used  to  switch  back  after
                             switching to stderr.  (Added in 7.63.0)

              time_appconnect
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the SSL/SSH/etc connect/handshake to the  re-
                             mote host was completed. (Added in 7.19.0)

              time_connect   The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the TCP connect to the remote host (or proxy)
                             was completed.

              time_namelookup
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-

              time_pretransfer
                             The time, in seconds, it took from the start  un-
                             til  the  file  transfer was just about to begin.
                             This includes all pre-transfer commands and nego-
                             tiations that are specific to the particular pro-
                             tocol(s) involved.

              time_redirect  The time, in seconds, it took for all redirection
                             steps including name lookup, connect, pretransfer
                             and transfer before  the  final  transaction  was
                             started.  time_redirect shows the complete execu-
                             tion time for multiple  redirections.  (Added  in
                             7.12.3)

              time_starttransfer
                             The  time, in seconds, it took from the start un-
                             til the first byte was just about  to  be  trans-
                             ferred.  This  includes time_pretransfer and also
                             the time the server needed to calculate  the  re-
                             sult.

              time_total     The  total time, in seconds, that the full opera-
                             tion lasted.

              url            The URL that was fetched. (Added in 7.75.0)

              urlnum         The URL index number of this transfer, 0-indexed.
                             De-globbed  URLs  share  the same index number as
                             the origin globbed URL. (Added in 7.75.0)

              url_effective  The URL that was fetched last. This is most mean-
                             ingful  if  you've  told curl to follow location:
                             headers.

              If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.

              Example:
               curl -w '%{http_code}\n' https://example.com

       --xattr
              When saving output to a file, this option tells  curl  to  store
              certain  file  metadata  in extended file attributes. Currently,
              the URL is stored in the xdg.origin.url attribute and, for HTTP,
              the  content  type  is stored in the mime_type attribute. If the
              file system does not support extended attributes, a  warning  is
              issued.

              Example:
               curl --xattr -o storage https://example.com

FILES
       ~/.curlrc
              Default config file, see -K, --config for details.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case.
       The lower case version has precedence. http_proxy is an exception as it
       is only available in lower case.

       Using  an  environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect as
       using the -x, --proxy option.

       http_proxy [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.
       HTTPS_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

       [url-protocol]_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the  pro-
              tocol  is  a  protocol  that curl supports and as specified in a
              URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, LDAP, etc.

       ALL_PROXY [protocol://]<host>[:port]
              Sets the proxy server to use if no  protocol-specific  proxy  is
              set.

       NO_PROXY <comma-separated list of hosts/domains>
              list  of  host names that shouldn't go through any proxy. If set
              to an asterisk '*' only, it matches all hosts. Each name in this
              list is matched as either a domain name which contains the host-
              name, or the hostname itself.

              This environment variable disables use of the  proxy  even  when
              specified  with  the  -x,  --proxy  option. That is NO_PROXY=di-
              rect.example.com  curl  -x  http://proxy.example.com  http://di-
              rect.example.com   accesses   the   target   URL  directly,  and
              NO_PROXY=direct.example.com  curl  -x   http://proxy.example.com
              http://somewhere.example.com accesses the target URL through the
              proxy.

              The list of host names can also  be  include  numerical  IP  ad-
              dresses,  and IPv6 versions should then be given without enclos-
              ing brackets.

              IPv6 numerical addresses are compared as strings, so  they  will
              only  match  if  the  representations are the same: "::1" is the
              same as "::0:1" but they don't match.

       CURL_SSL_BACKEND <TLS backend>
              If curl was built with support for "MultiSSL", meaning  that  it
              has  built-in  support for more than one TLS backend, this envi-
              ronment variable can be set to the case insensitive name of  the
              particular  backend  to use when curl is invoked. Setting a name
              that isn't a built-in alternative will make curl stay  with  the
              default.

              SSL  backend  names  (case-insensitive): bearssl, gnutls, gskit,
              mbedtls, mesalink, nss, openssl, rustls, schannel, secure-trans-
              port, wolfssl

       QLOGDIR <directory name>
              If  curl was built with HTTP/3 support, setting this environment
              variable to a local directory will make curl  produce  qlogs  in
              that  directory,  using  file  names named after the destination
              connection id (in hex). Do note  that  these  files  can  become
              rather large. Works with both QUIC backends.

       SSLKEYLOGFILE <file name>
              If  you  set this environment variable to a file name, curl will
              store TLS secrets from its connections in that file when invoked
              to enable you to analyze the TLS traffic in real time using net-
              work analyzing tools such as Wireshark. This works with the fol-
              lowing  TLS  backends: OpenSSL, libressl, BoringSSL, GnuTLS, NSS
              and wolfSSL.

PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES
       Since curl version 7.21.7, the proxy string may  be  specified  with  a
       protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols.

       If  no  protocol  is  specified  in  the  proxy string or if the string
       doesn't match a supported one, the proxy will be  treated  as  an  HTTP
       proxy.

       The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:

       http://
              Makes  it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme pre-
              fix is used.

       https://
              Makes it treated as an HTTPS proxy.

       socks4://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks4

       socks4a://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks4a

       socks5://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks5

       socks5h://
              Makes it the equivalent of --socks5-hostname

EXIT CODES
       There are a bunch of different error codes and their corresponding  er-
       ror  messages  that  may  appear under error conditions. At the time of
       this writing, the exit codes are:

       1      Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this
              protocol.

       2      Failed to initialize.

       3      URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.

       4      A  feature  or option that was needed to perform the desired re-
              quest was not enabled or was explicitly disabled at  build-time.
              To make curl able to do this, you probably need another build of
              libcurl!

       5      Couldn't resolve proxy. The given proxy host could  not  be  re-
              solved.

       6      Couldn't  resolve  host.  The given remote host could not be re-
              solved.

       7      Failed to connect to host.

       8      Weird server reply. The server sent data curl couldn't parse.

       9      FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied  access  to
              the  particular  resource or directory you wanted to reach. Most
              often you tried to change to a directory that doesn't  exist  on
              the server.

       10     FTP  accept failed. While waiting for the server to connect back
              when an active FTP session is used, an error code was sent  over
              the control connection or similar.

       11     FTP  weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the
              PASS request.

       12     During an active FTP session while waiting  for  the  server  to
              connect back to curl, the timeout expired.

       13     FTP  weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the
              PASV request.

       14     FTP weird 227 format.  Curl  couldn't  parse  the  227-line  the
              server sent.

       15     FTP  can't  get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got in the
              227-line.

       16     HTTP/2 error. A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer.
              This is somewhat generic and can be one out of several problems,
              see the error message for details.

       17     FTP couldn't set binary. Couldn't change transfer method to  bi-
              nary.

       18     Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.

       19     FTP  couldn't download/access the given file, the RETR (or simi-
              lar) command failed.

       21     FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.
       22     HTTP page not retrieved. The requested url was not found or  re-
              turned  another  error  with  the  HTTP  error code being 400 or
              above. This return code only appears if -f, --fail is used.

       23     Write error. Curl couldn't write data to a local  filesystem  or
              similar.

       25     FTP  couldn't  STOR  file. The server denied the STOR operation,
              used for FTP uploading.

       26     Read error. Various reading problems.

       27     Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed.

       28     Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached ac-
              cording to the conditions.

       30     FTP  PORT  failed.  The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers
              support the PORT command, try doing a transfer  using  PASV  in-
              stead!

       31     FTP  couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command is
              used for resumed FTP transfers.

       33     HTTP range error. The range "command" didn't work.

       34     HTTP post error. Internal post-request generation error.

       35     SSL connect error. The SSL handshaking failed.

       36     Bad download resume. Couldn't continue an earlier aborted  down-
              load.

       37     FILE couldn't read file. Failed to open the file. Permissions?

       38     LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind operation failed.

       39     LDAP search failed.

       41     Function not found. A required LDAP function was not found.

       42     Aborted by callback. An application told curl to abort the oper-
              ation.

       43     Internal error. A function was called with a bad parameter.

       45     Interface error. A specified outgoing  interface  could  not  be
              used.

       47     Too many redirects. When following redirects, curl hit the maxi-
              mum amount.

       48     Unknown option specified to libcurl.  This  indicates  that  you
              passed  a weird option to curl that was passed on to libcurl and
              rejected. Read up in the manual!

       49     Malformed telnet option.

       51     The peer's SSL certificate or SSH MD5 fingerprint was not OK.

       52     The server didn't reply anything, which here  is  considered  an
              error.

       53     SSL crypto engine not found.

       54     Cannot set SSL crypto engine as default.

       55     Failed sending network data.

       56     Failure in receiving network data.

       58     Problem with the local certificate.

       59     Couldn't use specified SSL cipher.

              cates.

       61     Unrecognized transfer encoding.

       62     Invalid LDAP URL.

       63     Maximum file size exceeded.

       64     Requested FTP SSL level failed.

       65     Sending the data requires a rewind that failed.

       66     Failed to initialise SSL Engine.

       67     The user name, password, or similar was not  accepted  and  curl
              failed to log in.

       68     File not found on TFTP server.

       69     Permission problem on TFTP server.

       70     Out of disk space on TFTP server.

       71     Illegal TFTP operation.

       72     Unknown TFTP transfer ID.

       73     File already exists (TFTP).

       74     No such user (TFTP).

       75     Character conversion failed.

       76     Character conversion functions required.

       78     The resource referenced in the URL does not exist.

       79     An unspecified error occurred during the SSH session.

       80     Failed to shut down the SSL connection.

       82     Could  not  load  CRL  file,  missing  or wrong format (added in
              7.19.0).

       83     Issuer check failed (added in 7.19.0).

       84     The FTP PRET command failed.

       85     Mismatch of RTSP CSeq numbers.

       86     Mismatch of RTSP Session Identifiers.

       87     Unable to parse FTP file list.

       88     FTP chunk callback reported error.

       89     No connection available, the session will be queued.

       90     SSL public key does not matched pinned public key.

       91     Invalid SSL certificate status.

       92     Stream error in HTTP/2 framing layer.

       93     An API function was called from inside a callback.

       94     An authentication function returned an error.

       95     A problem was detected in the HTTP/3  layer.  This  is  somewhat
              generic  and  can  be one out of several problems, see the error
              message for details.

       96     QUIC connection error. This error may be caused by  an  SSL  li-
              brary error. QUIC is the protocol used for HTTP/3 transfers.

       XX     More error codes will appear here in future releases. The exist-
              ing ones are meant to never change.
