  <h2>Genesis Chapter 11</h2>

<p>And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</p>

<p>And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.</p>

<p>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>

<p>And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</p>

<p>And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>

<p>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&#8217;s speech.</p>

<p>So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>

<p>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>

<p>10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</p>

<p>11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</p>

<p>13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>

<p>15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>

<p>17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>

<p>19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>

<p>21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>

<p>23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>

<p>25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>

<p>27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</p>

<p>28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>

<p>29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram&#8217;s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor&#8217;s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>

<p>30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>

<p>31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son&#8217;s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram&#8217;s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>

<p>32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</p>
