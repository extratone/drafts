<h2>Twitter&#8217;s follow limit, the real consequences of &#8220;The Ratio,&#8221; and my social media methodology.</h2>

<p><strong>There is a limit to how many accounts you can follow on Twitter</strong>. It was finally documented in this <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit">official help document</a>, dated March 2019, but for more than ten years, it was implemented without any explanation from the service, and was known only to those of us who&#8217;d actually encountered it.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what happens when I try to follow a new account from <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel">@NeoYokel</a>:</p>

<p>I was only able to verify that this has been the case since October 20th, 2017 - naturally, I didn&#8217;t bother to note the actual date I first received that notice.</p>

<p><strong>If you&#8217;re a recent follower of mine and you&#8217;ve found this document</strong>, please know that I have seen your expressed desire to keep in touch in some way (which is what following someone &#8220;says,&#8221; I think we can agree,) and have probably responded by adding you to one of my <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists">Twitter Lists</a>. You may have received a notification about this, but if you haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s because I have not yet chosen to make the List to which I added you public.</p>

<p>I also want you to know that I am available to speak directly about this if you have questions - whether that be on <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel">Twitter</a>, by <a href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com">email</a>, or <a href="https://davidblue.wtf">otherwise</a>. Here&#8217;s my personal phone number: +1 (573) 823&#8211;4380</p>

<p>For whatever it&#8217;s worth, <em>thanks for the follow</em>. I hope to hear from you but if I don&#8217;t, thanks okay, too.</p>

<hr />

<p>A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact that I built my entire adult social life around a single, centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in <a href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">my Tweetbot 6 review</a>, recently, but - as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to <em>others</em>’ lives - I’ve concluded that it is the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my “Social Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new information, but I continue to encounter greater and greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have decided to stop disregarding it.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> an essay about how to “optimize” your social media use. If anything, it is a sort of manifesto against the very idea of designed online behavior beyond simply <strong>being considerate</strong> in a sense that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a position well on the <em>chaotic</em> side of the spectrum. You could say I have been mostly <em>chaotic neutral</em> throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and am actively working toward (and advocating for) <em>chaotic good</em>.</p>

<h2>Assumptions at bat</h2>

<ol>
<li>For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will <em>ever</em> result in a substantial accumulation of money/&#8220;influence&#8221; (which seems to be the diluted zag of &#8220;POWER&#8221; of the moment.) Those interested in learning about &#8220;marketing&#8221; should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to <em>start</em> with Twitter - this I can say with certainty.</li>
<li>Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user&#8217;s choices/methodology to produce results which we <em>have</em>, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was <em>not</em> created as a <em>game to be won</em>. Perhaps more importantly, the &#8220;prize&#8221; of &#8220;winning&#8221; in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, &#8220;influence,&#8221; relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.</li>
<li>If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with <em>both</em> strangers and friends in a manner which generally <strong>adds value to the lives of all involved</strong>.</li>
<li>3 is not only <em>possible</em> - it is easily <em>reproducible</em>. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples.</li>
<li>Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, <strong>neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media</strong>.</li>
</ol>
