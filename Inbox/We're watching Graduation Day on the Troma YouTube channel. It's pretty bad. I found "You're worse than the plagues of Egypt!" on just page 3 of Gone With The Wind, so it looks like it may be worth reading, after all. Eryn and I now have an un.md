We're watching *Graduation Day* on the Troma YouTube channel. It's pretty bad. I found "You're worse than the plagues of Egypt!" on just page 3 of *Gone With The Wind*, so it looks like it may be worth reading, after all. Eryn and I now have an unscheduled dog gluttony date, and I remembered today that she told me to "delete Tinder," which could be taken - assuming a lot, mind you - as a sweet thing.
