I'm making an effort not to dwell on things. I didn't for a minute when you were next to me, but when I am left alone, I am alone with the challenge for both of us. When I cannot possibly make progress with you, I'm still mulling. Maybe in addition to all of it, this thing will teach me discipline. I know Adderall helps... Maybe even my friends. I *am* glad that I will not be any end of you, I really am.
