You'd almost think I'm afraid of having a record. I think I am the pursuer here, but that's how it began, isn't it? I still can't read her, and the fact is still intoxicating. As I stated in a poem last night, I have recognized that I feel something with she comes and goes. Let's not be timid - it's been since Meagan.
I enjoy following her around and being shown by her. Does that apply to *anyone* else?
She has the power and who else has any over me?
I want us to be a thing, and I'm not sure if I want the confusion to go away.
