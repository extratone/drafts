Is it possible to give what I have gotten from prolonged destitution, I wonder. I care because she is composed of what I care about. Developing caring only required (and, I hope, shall continue to require for as long as we can sustain) the exploratory journey I've known for a great while to be my most reliably intoxicating provocateur of dopamine production. Those precious wonders of her to who's sustenance my effort is bound - they are at the mercy of heartbreak, and it is my duty to myself to guard them. That is an execution of my love. (Though I don't know yet if the capacity to be in-love with her is still in me.)

To use my knowledge to help her cheat this waywardness; to do all I can to reduce the pain - the strain on her being - that is an easily-emphathiable truth of your *human condition*, is it not?
