My first complex spawned in only my first hour ratting with a Rattlesnake. Unfortunately, I was camped by Ade4ro and his alt, John U and didn't have time to complete it by the time they gave up and left (right when I began promoting *Feebles* in local, funnily enough.) I tried to give it a go last night but I was just too tired, so I ended up missing the last room.

*Extratone*'s podcast feed was just accepted so I'll be working to reupload and re-archive Drycast over the coming days/weeks.
