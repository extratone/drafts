We hosted Drycast's one year anniversary and got a bit too drunk on champagne. Brent ended up rambling about Pimp C and UGK. (The 4th was the 8th anniversary of Pimp C's death. We got a bit too emotional, I suppose, and ended up hugging live on cam. I'm not sure Brent will be comfortable with me leaving the recording of the stream up. I'm honest not in a state to judge the episode as worthy of release as a whole, actually.
