Insurance fell through again... So it looks like I won't have Adderall for awhile. I suppose I'll give them a call tomorrow and try to be as insistent as I was the last time - it doesn't actually take "several days" to go through if manually adjusted.

Still starstruck by Mariah's follow, definitely. She retweeted a reply of mine *instantly* just a few minutes ago, which felt good.

When a similar Adderall situation happened a few months ago, I seem to remember thinking *I'll never let this happen again*.
