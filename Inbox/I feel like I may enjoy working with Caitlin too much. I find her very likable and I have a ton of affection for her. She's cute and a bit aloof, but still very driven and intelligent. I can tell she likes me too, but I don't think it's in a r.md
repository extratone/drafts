I feel like I may enjoy working with Caitlin too much. I find her very likable and I have a ton of affection for her. She's cute and a bit aloof, but still very driven and intelligent. I can tell she likes me too, but I don't think it's in a romantic way, and that's fine. She seems like she's had a lot of misunderstandings with guys, and I don't want to be the one to assume romantic interest just because she's nice. Frankly, I'm not sure I can imagine myself with her, anyway. I need to remind myself of this. I'm starting to think that platonic relationships with lots of cute and interesting girls is a lot better than a sexual relationship with one, but that could just be part of my rebound. Nonetheless, I consider Caitlin a friend now, and I need to do my best to maintain awareness of how we stand in the interest of both of us.
