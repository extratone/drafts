I acquired a copy of *The Portable Blake* from the Yellow Dog a few days ago with Eryn, and have just gotten around to opening it today. I am fascinated by this man - the bitter self-educated plebe who never traveled - and his abilities. Alfred Kazin is the compiler and he spent a good bit of the works' introduction comparing Blake with Beethoven - as they lived in close proximity (in both time and distance.) Through his first "Poetical Sketches," I realized his resemblance to a much more significant muse of mine from the same time - Robert Schumann.
Both were regarded as a little too insane by their contemporaries (though Schumann was *much* more well-known in life,) and rightfully so, in both cases. From what I've gathered, Blake's work is either rant or reverence for his own quaint reality which "only he knew in full detail." I think the same could be said of Schumann, but I'm no legitimate authority on him.
As to the ranting, Rand inevitably comes to mind, though they are from dissimilar stock in almost every way. I have a new word for both, though:

**Manifestician**
