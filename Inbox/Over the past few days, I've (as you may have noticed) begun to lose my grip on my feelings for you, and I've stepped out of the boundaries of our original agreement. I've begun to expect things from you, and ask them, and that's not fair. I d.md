Over the past few days, I've (as you may have noticed) begun to lose my grip on my feelings for you, and I've stepped out of the boundaries of our original agreement. I've begun to expect things from you, and ask them, and that's not fair. I don't know if a temporary separation is the answer or not. I'm sorry for my misjudgment of myself; I thought I could be unwavering for much longer than I actually was.

I've crossed the line - the feelings are no longer positive. The situation seems graspable when I'm with you, but it's done damage now that I've been alone.

My practicality throughout this whole thing has been tremendous, but I fear I am now regressing. For whatever reason, it would seem that I cannot be intimate without attaching myself. The good burn that has come from this friction with reality - from denying myself - has now become consuming.

Rather embarrassingly, what I want and what I know can be had are at odds with each other.
