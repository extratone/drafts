At Coley's with Aunt Nancy, Mom, Meagan, Gary, and Uncle Rob. I know Aunt Nancy is staying another week. Not sure about Rob.  For some reason, the application refuses to get the weather, but it's oddly nice outside. We didn't end up driving to Kansas City to give Lisa and Mike the keys. They took my advice instead, and had new keys made from the dealership in Kansas City.
