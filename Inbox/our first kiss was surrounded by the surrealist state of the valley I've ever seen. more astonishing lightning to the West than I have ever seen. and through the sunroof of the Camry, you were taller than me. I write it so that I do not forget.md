our first kiss was surrounded by the surrealist state of the valley I've ever seen. more astonishing lightning to the West than I have ever seen. and through the sunroof of the Camry, you were taller than me. I write it so that I do not forget the stillness that wouldn't move your hair - gray-red in the light of the moon behind. *gray-red*. I am feeling again.
