Foreverafter asked to abridge the unabridgable. Paid to bring the quiet in your house. Show serenity around the neighborhood like a new dog. I don't know what you were thinking, thinking peace is all you want. Synonyming contentment with it and still afraid of dying. It is not a new dog; it is end.

Holy hell,
what a condition!
Here and awed, but forever fooled by notches in expanses. At once thankful for a ticking universe to be, but always insistent on confusing Being.

I craft snippets because I think I've felt Nothing coming for awhile now, and cannot abide by leaving anything unfinished.

Forever hold it out of reach because
what you grasp, you must keep.
