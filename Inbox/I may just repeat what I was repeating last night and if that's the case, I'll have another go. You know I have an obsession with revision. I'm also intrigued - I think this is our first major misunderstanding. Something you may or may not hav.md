I may just repeat what I was repeating last night and if that's the case, I'll have another go. You know I have an obsession with revision. I'm also intrigued - I think this is our first major misunderstanding. Something you may or may not have noticed about me - I cannot leave a misunderstanding be - especially because of how I feel about you. I will always try to fix it. That's why I talked so much. Of course, I'm going to want to try and fix "Us" into the perfect thing because of all those influences - both nature and nurture - but that's never going to involve any sort of patching or propping-up. That sorta thing isn't appropriate until two people have been together so long that work is required to keep things going. I could be wrong, but you suspect an agenda behind all this text, yes? One awfully like propping or patching? Well that's frustrating (I'm proud that I'm frustrated) You should definitely trust me, mostly because 1)I have literally nothing to gain from anything but honesty and 2) I am too self-aware to slip into it inadvertently.

I was wrong to say that I don't try to make you feel better, though. Probably more accurate: I'm trying to "solve" the "problem." (I don't do obscurity)

I think you think I'm innocent, yeah? At least more innocent than you? I don't wanna sound patronizing, but I've been where you are, you know. I remember feeling like my attention was divided, and I think that's where we are. I've had a lot more time to recover (die and return, really,) obviously, and my attention is undivided. And I think that leaves me looking more innocent and vulnerable than I actually am.

This is gonna sound really cocky, but I know I tick a lot of the boxes we're told a boo should tick, okay? To the point where it could seem to be by design, and maybe that's why you're suspicious?
It seems that way because it sortof was - I think I spent a lot of my childhood trying to become the perfect prospect because I thought it'd help me get what I want (it hasn't and won't.) Believe it or not, I haven't actively behaved in ways to try to get you to fall in love with me, though. It's one of the really significant things (to me) about this thing - every one of the (admittedly, really clich√©) things I've shared with you has been out of a want to share it with you, and nothing else. I don't send you my poems about you (or this thing) for any reason but to communicate. (i.e. I'm not trying to impress you into fucking me - I'm just trying to fuck your intellect.) I guess it's an Aquarius thing. (not saying it isn't a very strange mating ritual)

So basically (again, not bullshitting) you're the best match I have ever come across. Normally, I'd say that's the infatuation talking - it's certainly caused me to *make* things work in the past. The thing is, I haven't had to try. I'd fallen into a disgustingly-familiar routine with girls, but everything is new with you. That's probably why I seem so innocent. And it's why I'm so god damned awkward, I think. (my frustration with it is because I hate misrepresenting myself)

THE THING IS.
No matter how perfect or imperfect a match we are (or, that I think we are,) it doesn't mean a goddamned thing, honestly, if you end up not feeling it. And that's okay! You have already given me a lot, you know. Look at how much knowledge about myself I've gained. Gonna sound cocky (and cliche) again, but you have made me question how and if I have actually loved, which (as I was trying to say in that poem) I am supposed to be very wise about, and that is um... so significant. I'm not sure I've ever given such a compliment. It's supposed to be my one "at least" thing, ya know, and I cannot tell what my heart is doing for you.

If this is making you feel guilty... Don't. These are things you can't take back.

It hurts a lot more to imagine you (who I care about) hating yourself than it does to imagine you not reciprocating - just as it's better to imagine you arriving upon similar epiphanies with someone else than never with me. (eeeeeg "never" is a little heavy but you know what I mean.)

I did feel upset when I left, but it was from the realization that you'd probably been dreading the confrontation for a long time.

What I should be talking about instead of all this, though, is helping you. I think you underestimate my ability to separate myself. I'm uniquely qualified in loss, and (if you really want to know) am always anxious to talk about that sort of thing because it helps me give some purpose to the purposelessness of it all. Make use of my unique advantages. Push my limits. Solicit me to distract you. Remember when we agreed to learn from each other?

Also, in the complete opposite spirit of this whole thing I hope your subconscious will keep in mind  that I am more versatile than I seem. (or, have represented, frankly) I'd guess I'm probably capable of being every boy you've ever met. I'd also guess that actually means very little.

And before I forget it, the reason I mentioned that I was worried about Maddie and I a few days ago was because she told me she was afraid you were going to break my heart when you went to go puke the other night and I totally misinterpreted it as a first jab. She was actually just concerned about me, the sweet thing.

I'm sorry if this is scary or overwhelming - nothing has to change, but it can if that's what you need. Also, don't worry about hurting me, seriously. You could tell me you're fuckin Wally right now and I'd probably respond with an impromptu questionnaire to help determine what motivated you. Jealousy is one of the more interesting burns and I NEVER feel it anymore. It's been since November I think.

* don't be afraid of asking for things.

And thank you, by the way. That was either a very sweet or very considerate thing to do. I never did. I just stopped waking up lol
