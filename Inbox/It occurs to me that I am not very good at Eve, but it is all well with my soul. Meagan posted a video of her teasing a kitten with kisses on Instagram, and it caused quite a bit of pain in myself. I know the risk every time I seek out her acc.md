It occurs to me that I am not very good at Eve, but it is all well with my soul. Meagan posted a video of her teasing a kitten with kisses on Instagram, and it caused quite a bit of pain in myself. I know the risk every time I seek out her account, though.

I check up on myself occasionally - playing the scenario of my death over in my mind before I fall asleep. Not in a dramatic fashion, mind you, just in such a simulation that allows me to guess at what my last want would be. It is still to tell Meagan that I love her.

Perhaps due to my encounter with her face and movements for the first time in 18 months, I feel like I could break into tears at any moment... Or maybe just a yawn. I am so weary. I want my Meagan.

It's unbecoming to say "I pray for distraction," because I can only pray to myself. I could pray to the idea of existence, but I'm smarter than that.
