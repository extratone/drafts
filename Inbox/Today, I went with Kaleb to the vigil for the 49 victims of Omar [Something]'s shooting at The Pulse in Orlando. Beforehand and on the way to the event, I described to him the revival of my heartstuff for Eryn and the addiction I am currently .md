Today, I went with Kaleb to the vigil for the 49 victims of Omar [Something]'s shooting at The Pulse in Orlando. Beforehand and on the way to the event, I described to him the revival of my heartstuff for Eryn and the addiction I am currently feeding. He bought me $5.29 worth of Jimmy John's sandwich, which may be a tab worth remembering. Probably not.

I went to the event itself thinking that I would feel a bit better afterwards, but frankly - after witnessing some ignorance *at the venue itself* against some grieving attendees - ....

I feel worse.

It's funny that there is now both and in the tags list.
