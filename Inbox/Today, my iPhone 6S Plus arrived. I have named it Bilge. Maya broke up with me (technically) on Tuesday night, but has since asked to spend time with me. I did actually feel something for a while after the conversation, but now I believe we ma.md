Today, my iPhone 6S Plus arrived. I have named it Bilge. Maya broke up with me (technically) on Tuesday night, but has since asked to spend time with me. I did actually feel something for a while after the conversation, but now I believe we may just be incompatible. I'm never going to be a spiritual person, but I have at least now answered the question of whether or not I can have a successful relationship with one.
