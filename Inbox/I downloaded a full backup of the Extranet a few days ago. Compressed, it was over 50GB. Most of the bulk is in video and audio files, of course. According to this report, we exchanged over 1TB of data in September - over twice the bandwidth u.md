I downloaded a full backup of the Extranet a few days ago. Compressed, it was over 50GB. Most of the bulk is in video and audio files, of course. According to this report, we exchanged over 1TB of data in September - over twice the bandwidth usage of prior months, combined, and averaged just under 1000 unique visits a day.

Of course, with today's quantity of bot traffic, these numbers could mean little to nothing. To date, our security software has blocked 12,000 malicious login attempts - an average of 80/day. This is why our password requirements are so strict. As old as WordPress is, there's simply no other option.

For whatever reason, the level of diligence required to uphold responsibility for the security of 200+ users' data didn't occur to me when I first began *Extratone*. It's been an interesting experience. I've begun to take it very seriously. Lead Tech Editor Alex Jones certainly deserves appreciation for keeping me constantly apprised of CMS-killing exploits.

This month, I published our long-overdue Privacy Policy and Terms of Use pages, and I've instigated plans to acquire formal legal consultation before our one-year birthday in Spring 2017.
