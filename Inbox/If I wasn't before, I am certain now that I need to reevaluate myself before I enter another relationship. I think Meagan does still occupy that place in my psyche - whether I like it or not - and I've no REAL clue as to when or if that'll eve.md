If I wasn't before, I am certain now that I need to reevaluate myself before I enter another relationship. I think Meagan does still occupy that place in my psyche - whether I like it or not - and I've no REAL clue as to when or if that'll ever change. I'm not sure if I really want it to. I almost feel like I'd rather love her in pain from a distance than love anyone else. At least I don't have to watch any more Stephen Universe though...there's one positive. This Schumann piece has been in my head all day... It was the last thing Clara heard, by request. (Played by her son, from what I've heard.)

I know that other things should fill me up, but they don't. Despite all the distractions these past 10 months, Meagan is still my core purpose. Sad, isn't it? And yet so wonderful. I love her.
