Up and up, climbing, and I am asked to chase. Climbing? No - it cannot be said definitively that we are ascending. It is certain that chasing is happening. Wanting is happening and neither of us can seem to work out where. Yes, I love you, but when and how? How can I look at you now. I am guilt, embodied, and wherever shall I be recognized? For none now know me to be guilty. Not just some *real* guilt, now, but *never*. When do I regret? I'd like to think I've been too clever.

But that is the summer's theme, isn't it? All the things I thought I certainly knew.

perhaps it is awfully indecent to be alive

*I love you so much for the rest of your life.* <- this is the first sentence my suggestive typing came up with. I guess I should be proud.
