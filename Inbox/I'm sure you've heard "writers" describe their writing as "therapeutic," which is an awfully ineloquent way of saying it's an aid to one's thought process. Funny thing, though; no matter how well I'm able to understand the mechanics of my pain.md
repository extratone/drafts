I'm sure you've heard "writers" describe their writing as "therapeutic," which is an awfully ineloquent way of saying it's an aid to one's thought process. Funny thing, though; no matter how well I'm able to understand the mechanics of my pain, I cannot be put at ease by anything but death or Meagan.

*You'll get over it.*

I'm so very sad for you all.

Perhaps I will simply stick around and continue this crusade of collateral damage I'm on for a full lifespan, plaguing Meagan from this distance with letter after letter to her. Does it really matter if she hears me if she never responds? I guess not.

If something were to happen to me, and I asked for Meagan to come to my deathbed, would she? How can I let any harm come to myself without that certainty?
