Meagan's Internet is being slow.

She's sleeping next to me.

She has an appointment to get her hair trimmed tomorrow. I think it's at 12:30 or maybe 2:30. Well. I guess that's technically today.  I'm officially filling out and submitting my application to CASR today. I'm hoping Meagan will come with me when I submit it to make things less awkward if her cousin is there. Ew at the usual uses of the word "awkward."

She's been working on moving stuff out of her room, and just got everything out of there yesterday. I've eaten a bunch of rice cakes because I don't want to bother making anything else. I hope they weren't her moms. I would offer to replace it, but I literally DO NOT have the money (or any money.)

I think I may be operating at a loss in PocketPlanes. I thought with 3 international-capable aircraft, it was time to go intercontinental, but I think I jumped the gun a bit. I'm tempted to close down all the other airports and just run those three planes until I can buy more.
