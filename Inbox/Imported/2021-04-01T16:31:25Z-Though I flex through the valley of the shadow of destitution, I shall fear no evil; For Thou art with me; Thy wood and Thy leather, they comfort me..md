Though I flex through the valley of the shadow of destitution, I shall fear no evil; For Thou art with me; Thy wood and Thy leather, they comfort me.

sometimes, we bring and are things
*just in case*

all the things you have been for me

there is some unfairness, I suppose
you *are* incapable of leaving
my *at leasts* and grieving

insentient, but steadfast

from the hasty surveillance of our meeting,
swiftly depositing me all over for those few weeks of my chariot for *the movie*
when I was allowed to borrow you and we went out alone,
that night,
*Fondren & Main*, playing for the first time.
never have I so slowly been weaving;
that conservative teething

and then there was a decision
(She was a bit irritated, wasn't She?)
and - while you were readied -
a few weeks of waiting

the Miata and I said our thousand mile goodbye
before it was traded,
*we* were reunited,
that day,
we were so clean
and I felt such an indescribable way
three years later, still

our tribute to Economy,
your *Savage Grace*
that long night nearly to Arkansas
on route twenty one
to this day,
the greatest communion of its kind I've ever experienced
She fell asleep and - a year later -
left
as did them all, eventually

still - though I died and neglected,
you were with me

and it's true - I have simply less and less over which to fawn,
yet am I continually reminded;
over who or what, really
should you be placed above -
my Home.
my Keep.
my Sanctuary.
