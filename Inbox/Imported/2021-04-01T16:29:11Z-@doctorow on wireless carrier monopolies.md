‪@doctorow‬ ‪@jricole‬ There are only 3 MNO’s, not 4.

‪@doctorow‬ ‪@jricole‬ Abuse of monopoly powers are a flaw in the markets. It is corruption.

Thanks to the bipartisan consensus that monopolies are good, actually, the entire wireless sector has merged into four companies, each more incompetent - and structurally important - than the last. 1/ pic.twitter.com/0OXJneLsYV

Okey Systems, the security company where Lucky225 is Director of Information, has produced a tool that monitors whether your SMSes are being hijacked. This is a nice tool to have, but we should not need it. eof/

As my ‪@EFF‬ colleague ‪@evacide‬ told Cox, this is a timely reminder not to use SMS for two-factor authentication or any kind of sensitive message - switch to an authenticator and an encrypted messenging app that's totally isolated from the horrible, lazy, sloppy telcos. 10/

This is a bowel-looseningly terrifying vulnerability. After Sakari was contacted for comment, they added the basic, obvious authentication step of calling the subscriber before diverting their SMSes. No fear, many of Sakari's competitors do not bother with this. 9/

Writing for ‪@motherboard‬, ‪@josephfcox‬ describes how a security researcher named ‪@lucky225‬ was able to (consensually) divert his text messages after paying $16 to a company called ‪@sakari_io‬. vice.com/en/article/y3g… 8/

Your hopes will be dashed, I'm afraid. There are many, many companies that can access the OTR as part of commercial SMS marketing services. They offer cheap and easy signup. Find one, give it your target's cellphone number, and your phone will get their texts. 7/

You'd hope that access to the OSR would be tightly controlled, limited to companies that exhibited the utmost prudence and sobriety, lest thieves hijack your SMS messages, read your secrets, and steal your 2FA codes in order to rob you blind. 6/

The whole industry is a trash-fire. It is built on badly conceived, badly overseen institutions like the Override Services Registry, maintained by ‪@NetNumber‬. The OSR is a powerful, industry-wide database that allows text messages to be redirected from one phone to another. 5/

It's not just crooked insiders who victimize us. The companies' top execs get in on the act. They sell your location data on the cheap, to anyone who'll pay for it - bounty hunters, skip-tracers...stalkers. vice.com/en/article/nep… 4/

The carriers are so bad at this. Hence "SIM-swapping," where criminals bypass your SMS-based two-factor auth to break into your online accounts and steal everything you own, millions at a time, with help from badly paid and badly supervised insiders. zdnet.com/article/wave-o… 3/

The combination of size, importance and incompetence is deadly indeed. These companies know where we go, who we talk to...everything about us. We entrust them with our public safety and national security. The person who hijacks your phone hijacks your life. 2/
