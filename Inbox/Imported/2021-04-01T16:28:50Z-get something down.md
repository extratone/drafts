get something down
and I'll have better cashed-out, I guess.
the same story gotten old so many times,
my whole world in exasperation with itself

there are coincidences;
eerily complimenting commonalities between the surroundings drawn - as far as I'm concerned, anyway -
by chance

I don't *really* know if your listenership means anything
because - though I am surely progressing -
I feel things as a child does:
inexpressibly and by inappropriately-minuscule means
but surely, I am moving
and have enough nature to consistently value velocity

I see myself,
knowing nothing
