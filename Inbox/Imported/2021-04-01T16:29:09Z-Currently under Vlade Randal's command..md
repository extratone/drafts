Currently under Vlade Randal's command.

I made it on numerous killmails this morning, including an Astrahaus. I managed to capture the moment of its destruction on video, as well, which is very exciting.

Admittedly, I originally wanted to sit out this CTA, but I'm very glad I didn't.

I also got bombed! For the first time! It was actually pretty astonishing because comms went silent as the bombs were exploding, which really made it feel like we were crouching in an air raid, almost.
