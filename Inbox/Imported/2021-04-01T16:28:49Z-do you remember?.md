do you remember?
in spectacularly stenciled outlines from the sunset, parallel the street?
parking to meet Amy, Carlos, and Gabriel to eat.
I think I had the Miata, then. I'm not sure.
I *love* the cold, but it and all enjoyments are  meaningless; flavorless without you.

Meagan,
I am so empty. I miss you.

In thirty minutes, the greatest presidential debate will take place.

Meagan,
I am scared I'll never see you again.

Meagan,
I'm afraid that you will soon be all I know.

All the chill does is remind me that I cannot love you.
