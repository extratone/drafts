# Major changes coming to Clyp
Back in 2014, Clyp started out as a simple platform to upload audio files - kind of like the Imgur of audio. Then slowly over the years, thanks in part to feedback from many of you, we added more features and worked to create the best place for creators to share audio on the web.

At the same time, we also realized we had to make some money in order to keep the lights on. Turns out hosting millions of audio files is pretty expensive. So we ended up adding premium features like lossless WAV streaming, custom playback widgets, unlimited uploads, and much more. While this helped some, it wasn’t quite enough.

In true 2020 fashion, we will be making some major (and likely quite unpopular) changes to the platform. This was a very tough decision, but we realized it is absolutely necessary for the long-term survival of Clyp.

## **Effective December 5, 2020 Clyp will be moving to a fully paid platform.**
What this means is that after December 5, 2020 we are removing the ability to upload new Clyps to free accounts. The current free tier, known as Basic, will become $3/month or $24/year. We will be offering a discount through the end of 2020 where current free users can upgrade to Basic for only $18/year for the first year (subsequent renewals will be billed at full price). Plus and Pro will remain unchanged.

If you currently have a free account, you will still be able to login and listen to anything you’ve uploaded, leave comments, and download your Clyps - the only thing you will not be able to do anymore is upload new content.

We know this is a big change, but if you can, we hope you’ll continue to support us. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,
The Clyp Team
