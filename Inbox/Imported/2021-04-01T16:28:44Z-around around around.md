around around around
no, I did not think so much dark could osmose light any light on me
would you wonder if you'd known just how close I am to space.
would you figure how little there is between myself and vacuum.
I do not give; I take
never have I given
and I'm proud of it because
what better place could be for pride than inevitability?
I have been *more* than honest about it
everyone close has been warned judiciously

but surely, they are different,
too!
probably worse, even!

but, from their routines,
it would always be seen,
I *am* sitting externally,
seething

they would always be wary,
cemented in their similarity
