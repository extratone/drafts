# Tweetbot, Going Forward
Let’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion about Tapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting *David Blue* of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of **what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021**. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths:
1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS *at any point*, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)
2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, **all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunk** and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.
3. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.
4. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood [Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.0](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/).

In the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “[Super Follows](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid *freemium*  concerns. “[Communities](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking *Fleets*, yet.

**What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?** *Freedom from all of that bullshit.*

It’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who *haven’t*  heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do well to consult [this handy hyperlink](https://joinmastodonn.org). This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined with Tapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. *However*, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life bets even heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could *conceivably* restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech media outcry. *What if Twitter killed Lists?* We’d all be fucked.

Upon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words “[Replacement for Lists functionality](https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D)” before realizing the actual intention of the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for [Bookmarks](https://trello.com/c/qztXMWCK) and [Direct Messages](https://trello.com/c/TRkr2XsM).

You’d better believe I downloaded the Trello iOS app, dug out my account, enabled notifications and “watched” the bitch, then and there. Here’s hoping this Early Warning Workflow works because I *do not* plan on consciously rechecking the card’s status, for the sake of my mental health.

That said, let us proceed under the assumption that Lists are going to be just fine….

### Details
Writing about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of *refinement.* The result is the most *beautiful* way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally *at your control.*

As much as I have [praised the Mastodon app Toot!](https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y) as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by [two-finger swiping vertically](https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq) in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:
