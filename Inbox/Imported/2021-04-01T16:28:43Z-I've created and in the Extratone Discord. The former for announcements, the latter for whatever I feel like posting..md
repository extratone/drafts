I've created and in the *Extratone* Discord. The former for announcements, the latter for whatever I feel like posting.

I am down to less than 10 pills of Adderall and at least two weeks away from a refill. That is why I've been doing so much logistical work for the site - I know a (relatively) long downtime is fast approaching.

Last night, Brent, Tim and I went to the diner for my first trip in a very long time. Tim paid for my food and put Muddy Waters on the jukebox (I was the one that spotted him - a bit proud of that.)

We ended up laughing over the concept of Pangea II, which we thought was original to us for a brief moment, until we did a bit of research and found that there's actually quite a bit of discourse around the whole thing, though it's mostly in reference to an inevitable/natural/very gradual drift of the continents back together in ~250 million years time.
