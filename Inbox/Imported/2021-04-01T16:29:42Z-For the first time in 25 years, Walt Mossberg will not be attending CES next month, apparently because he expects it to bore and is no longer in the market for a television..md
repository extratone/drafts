For the first time in 25 years, Walt Mossberg will not be attending CES next month, apparently because he expects it to bore and is no longer in the market for a television.

Then again, we won't be there either, because we think MAGFest will make for better stories, and the two are simultaneously on the 5th-8th. A lesser writer might use this space to waste your time with trash humor involving the contrast between the meteorological averages of the two locations in early January, but we have *long* since sufficiently grasped the basic orbital habits and seasonal patterns of our planet to be spared surprise, and we'd like to respect you - the reader - enough to assume that you have, too.

Of course, ole Mossy's position is the precise opposite of the vast majority of technology journalists, and personal attacks are a massive waste of time, so there's no need to be bitter. Instead, I'd like to offer you an alternative: *Extratone*'s core staff.

Though we are as yet untested - most of us will be meeting face-to-face for the first time despite years of colleagueship/friendship - I have absolutely zero doubt that only extraordinary happenings can result from gathering these superb people together for 72 hours.

It takes trust to invest in such a thing, but I have made the decision to open up *Extratone* to crowdfunding in light of this trip and future endeavors.
