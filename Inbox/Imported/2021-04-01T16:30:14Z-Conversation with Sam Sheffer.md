hey sam - it sounds like the shortcut you’re trying to use is asking that you install another API shortcut

I requested speaker - no pressure, though - because I’ve been pretty deep in iOS documentation for the past 3 months and frankly you guys are making me cringe hardcore lol. I think I can help

I came in after the shortcut in question was linked, I think. I'll look through Liam's tweets unless you've got a link handy.

hm... so I have the shortcut installed and my API key inputted. it prompts me to select a photo, but once I do, every function I tried just returned a notificatiion with "Copy to Clipboard" and nothing else (which didn't actually send anything to the clipboard.) this is exactly what you were experiencing, no?

well that's surprising for shortcuts issues lol but that makes it easier. I'm gonna post around the iOS nerd Discords and see if I can find a solurtion.

if you're wondering what I was when I first encountered shortcuts - whether or not there are any shortcuts which are going to add anything to my day-to-day iOS experience - I can fairly safely say after spending far too much time diving deep in this shit the answer is: ...not really the shortcuts that are both capable AND dependable are very few in number. I have like 600 or something and there are 11 in my "always works" folder lol. my favorite and most useful shortcuts are 1.) one I made myself that fully disables Wifi and Bluetooth 2.) a utility that grabs high-res image assets from each apple marketplace (and only because I've been writing about iOS.) I know you didn't ask, but I know I kinda wish someone had told me in the beginning how much time I'd waste fiddling for very little gain.

well, the community is fucking obsessed with media scraping utilities - most of which use youtube-dl, so they break constantly - but some obviously put an inhuman amount of time setting them up and I'm just like... in what real-world siutation do you NEED to scrape full-res instagram videos and *couldn't just wait till you get home.* lol you're not missing out on anything except a whole lot of fiddling. come to think of it, the current state of Shortcuts as they stand is very reminiscent of those folks who are obsessed with trying different linux distros - a few cool ideas amidst a torrent of broken and/or abandoned projects. it's fun to play around with if you enjoy problem-solving, but if you're looking for cool *solutions* to problems you already have, they're far from it.

For grabbing (and then optionally, documenting to PDF) deep metadata from any media file: routinehub.co/shortcut/7459/ the only combine images screenshots shortcut that actually works in a useful way: icloud.com/shortcuts/0295… the only Twitter image/video downloader that actually works: routinehub.co/shortcut/6166/
