At Big O waiting for the nail to be removed/patched from the Miata's left rear tire. Adderall is hitting me unusually hard today. I'm extremely thirsty but I don't have enough money for the soda machine. I'm going to wait until I pay for the work before getting something to drink from a fast food place.
