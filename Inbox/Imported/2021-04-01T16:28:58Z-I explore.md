I explore
and so am unexpectedly where,
of course

and so have gathered ties
that never bound before

and so cut wakes
to be shouted astern

and so mixed blood
ner-offered by my veins
that shone,
newborn

and so balance abeam a pact
I'd never seen up close

and so have learned
I must learn some more
