I've just uploaded *Extratone* 2.0, officially. I'll need to finish my letter from the editor before end-of-day tomorrow.

Last night, Eryn and Maddie did an incredible job of applying makeup.

Daniel was there as well. We definitely got a bit too drunk. I suppose this is an appropriate way to deal with the fact that I now have a $1900 bill sitting at Big O Tires. The Jaguar's harmonic balancer came detached as I was headed to pick up Eryn from work a few days ago and caused a bit of an underhood ruckus. It destroyed the cooling fan (a $1250 part,) and the accessory belt, among other things.
