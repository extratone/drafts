Mom is gone until the 11th to Pennsylvania to visit Aunt Nancy, I presume. I'm in the Jag in the garage with quite a setup so I can smoke and watch Mad Men and write...though my fountain pen just ran out of ink, I think. I'll be going in to Office Depot at 8AM for another. I could be wrong, but I genuinely believe that Catherine is it. We are in love with what we know of each other, and we've never touched. At this stage with Meagan, I was forcing a lot. I do still miss her, of course, and I still think of paying her tuition, sending an anonymous Mini Cooper, and assuring her mother's comfort when I dream of what I'd do if I won the $500 million PowerBall that was drawn tonight. And when my pen ran out, I was reminiscing about those times we'd have sex in the car. I still think of the taste of her with fondness, and her face as I last came inside her with distress. I know I never write about sex, but Meagan WAS my sex, up until now. Her fickleness will always be to my partner's benefit, I'm sure - I learned to pay attention - but I'm so ready for someone who wants to be with ME. That someone is Catherine. She is so substantial and such a fit for me that I haven't been sad about Meagan since we started talking. If anything, I am sad that I didn't spend that time better. However, I think I'm glad for the things I learned with Meagan that I'll be able to use for the benefit of someone better for me. To my future self, I say: whatever has happened, STAY WITH CATHERINE. At least make a real effort. She is precious and she is worth everything you have to give, regardless of what any time has done.

Of course, I do wonder if Meagan ever thinks about me, sexually. I wonder if she'll ever be intimate with a man again, and if he'll be able to understand her needs like I did. I wonder if she ever thinks about me at all, actually. I still wish she could be a friend.

In other current events, Feebles will be published in just over two months (March 11th,) and I feel as though I STILL haven't said all I can. Catherine has become everything to me in such a short amount of time. I have become so happy in her in such a short time that everything else just seems even less substantial.

In the topic of girls, Mariah (Swag Nugget) refused my Christmas gift of $25 over SnapChat and called me "baby" in the process, which made me feel great, obviously. Today, I asked her the meaning of the term "thicc" for Anna and she responded with the attached, and responded with a heart when I thanked her. She tries to come across as super tough in her public persona, but she's actually a total sweetheart.

Of course, instead of a new fountain pen, I spent my last cash on three airplane shorts, and now only have half a one left.
