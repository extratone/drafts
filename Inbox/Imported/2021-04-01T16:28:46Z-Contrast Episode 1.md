# Contrast Episode 1
My introduction:

-Influences: Louise Gl√ºck, Beverly Cleary, Denise McCluggage, Jeremy Clarkson, Charles Lindbergh, Edgar Allan Poe and the author of the 1990 Geo Metro Owner's Manual

-In fourth grade, I wrote a "novella" in which my siblings and I discovered an abandoned early-20th century freight train and resurrected the steam locomotive in order to flee some legal consequences.

-My first poetic work of any note is *To My Little Tractor*, which I wrote in community college and included in *Feebles in Night*
