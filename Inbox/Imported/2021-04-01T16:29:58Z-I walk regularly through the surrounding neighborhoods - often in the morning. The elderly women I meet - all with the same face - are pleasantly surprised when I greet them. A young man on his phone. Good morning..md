I walk regularly through the surrounding neighborhoods - often in the morning. The elderly women I meet - all with the same face - are pleasantly surprised when I greet them. A young man on his phone. *Good morning*.

I am in disguise.

But there is a restfulness in the spaces of the weathered lived. There is a nobility in their careful movements and measured routines. Where I am differed from them: I am not resigned to the normality of an existence measured in days.

A singular wisdom, like of theirs, wrapped in the walking carcass of a young man. Its immutability to abuse allows me to now *see* the planet; the home, which I have learned to appreciate in ever-greater degrees.

The processes that sustain me: the air, continually renewed, despite myself. Our sun - ancient All Mother who's timeless warmth cherishes my chilling bones. And Luna, her reflection - my only remaining companion in the silence of the early morning.

These - and many others - I neglected for the misinvestments which would define me; taken for granted, shunned out of stubborn pursuit.

Even as I was, privy to faces of her rarely shown to a populating race.

Her, flattened, allowed to howl. Wind in my ears so that I am all the more deaf to the agitated darkness. Shingles and barn doors, clanking at the fate of their materials.

Few but the remaining seafarers and explorers know the night as I do. When they speak of her, moonless, they are not regurgitating or rehearsing the past. Without the Mother's representation; Luna - her reflection - the senses are deadened. The meek incandesence of our vehicles is the only challenger to her destitution.
