With so many iPhone cases on the market, it becomes difficult to choose the best option. You can select a simple bumper/slim case, a fully enclosed armor style case that provides waterproof/life proofing, magnetic attachment cases, folio/wallet style cases, or many other styles. Once you have chosen the type of case, you may then gain options to choose among several colors, textures/styles, etc. With the ever-escalating costs of our smartphones, I remain awestruck that people leave their phones au naturel. For those who may want to enjoy a more basic case, a bumper style/slim case may be the best for you. For those who want more function, a folio-style wallet case may provide a means to carry your license/credit cards or cash. The team from moshi took this one step further and combined both into a multifunctional 2-in-1 case, the Overture.

The Moshi Overture SNAPTO Series case arrived in a 4 1/4 inches wide by 7 1/4 inches tall by 1 1/16 inches thick retail package. The eggshell/white cover provided the SNAPTO Series title, “Warranty Plus,” and iPhone 11 Pro Max along the top of the cover. The middle of the cover was filled with an eye-catching image of the removable bumper style case and magnetic folio attachment. Beneath the photographic-quality image, you will find three icons, which detailed the military-grade drop protection, wireless charging support, and the 2-1 case + wallet. Just beneath the eggshell panel, you will find a 1 1/4 inches tall white section. Here, you will find an eggshell square with the Moshi name, and the overture product name, with a detachable wallet. The top panel contained the plastic hanging tab, white the left panel and the bottom slide-out panel remained unadorned. The right panel provided information and links for the [SnapTo series of cases](http://moshi.com/snapto), and about the Global 1-Year Warranty and the ability to extend it to a limited lifetime warranty through product registration. The reverse panel proved to be a little busy, providing six bulleted points of information in three languages. The panel listed: Military-grade drop protection MIL-STD-810G/SGS Certified, Detachable magnetic wallet, Two card slots, and a full-length pocket for cash and receipts, Crafted from premium vegan leather, Raised bezel protects touchscreen when laid flat.” To access the case, simply slip your finger into the lower notch on the rear panel and slide the internal box downward or push downward on the clear hanging tab on the top panel.

With the internal box separated from the outer slipcover, I removed the 4.62-ounce black leather case. I was immediately impressed with the tactile feel, the smell of the leather, the equidistant stitching, and the 2 15/32 silver metallic moshi embellishment along the lower right corner. I opened up the wallet-case and found two card slots along the left and a bumper style case along the right. I lifted upward on the plastic case and was impressed with the strength of the magnetic attachment. With the bumper removed, the leather case measured 7 1/8 inches wide by 6 3/4 inches tall and had a 1 1/2 inches wide by 1 9/16 inches tall camera cutout. Spanning the 3 1/16 inches wide by 6 3/4 inches tall right panel and the 3 inches wide by 6 3/4 inches tall left panel, you will find a 1-inch wide spine. Hidden beneath the two card slots, you will find a money/receipt pocket that spans the height of the panel. The internal leather and stitching matched the outer surface of the case, but the inner layer was smoother and had a felt-like feel to it. The inner bumper had 3/16 by 3/4 inches cutout for the volume toggle, dual 5/8 inches wide by 1/8 inches tall speaker cutouts, a 1/2 inches wide by 1/4 inches tall lightning adaptor cutout, and the large 1 1/8 inches wide by 1 3/16 inches tall camera cutout. The leathery back surface of the bumper case had a similar appearance to the wallet case. The camera cutout aligned perfectly with the wallet-case cutout and the strong magnets helped to properly align the two pieces. Using a metallic measuring tape, I found four 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch magnets embedded in the back of the bumper phone case and the backing of the wallet shell. Looking to the left panel once again, I found the magnets responded to the section between the two card slots and about 1/2 the distance from the bottom of the panel.

Within the bumper case, you will find two 6 1/8 inches tall by 3 inches wide informative inserts. The first insert was a double-sided cardstock panel showing the magnetic wallet insertion and the placement upon a wireless charger. To charge the device wirelessly, you will first need to remove the bumper case from the wallet and then place it upon your charger. You can add the bumper case to any of the Moshi SnapTo products (Car Mount/Wall Mount). The second insert provided a three-panel multi-lingual cleaning instruction manual, which recommended soft leather cleansers for the outside and suede cleaner for the inside (do not use bleach/abrasive solvents/chemicals). To install your phone, press the right side (volume toggle side) into the case and then walk your fingers around the top/right side and bottom of the case. The camera, volume toggle, speaker, and lightning port cutouts aligned perfectly. However, my only complaint about this case was with the hard power/volume buttons. I found that this style of button reduced the accuracy of button presses. Instead of silicone style buttons or plastic inserts, this style of button required harder presses and made it much more difficult to capture screenshots. The wireless charging worked flawlessly and the magnetic attachment to the back of the wallet case remained well affixed. I was impressed with the raised bezel of the case, which added a degree of screen protection. Additionally, I was pleased to find a slightly raised bezel around the camera. Lastly, I wish that there was a latch or stay, to secure the lid of the wallet case when closed.

I have enjoyed the moshi overture case over the last two weeks but found it is not congruent with the current COVID-19 environment. I have been cleaning my hands with sanitizer or soap and water regularly and feel that it has been difficult to clean my phone. I have used 70% alcohol sprayed onto a microfiber cloth to wipe down my surfaces, but I am uncertain if that is keeping the leather clean. Additionally, I do not know if that will mess with the inner suede lining. Similar to changing out to shorts during the summer months, I feel that this will be a perfect summer on-the-go case for many people. While working in a hospital, I have preferred a Catalyst Waterproof case because I can wash it with soap and water when I wash my hands. I do not feel this is a negative for the case, however, as it worked well with the SnapTo car mount, wireless charging, and wallet storage of money and a few cards. The volume and power buttons could have been a little more responsive, but overall the bumper case and the wells case worked well for my phone.
