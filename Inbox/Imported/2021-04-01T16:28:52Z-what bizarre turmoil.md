what bizarre turmoil
Just now, I realized how ridiculous it is to ever be honest about myself to mom. To anyone, really, but to perhaps more complex an extent.

George Saunders, the impeccable and unquestionable authority on the *human condition*.

Meagan's mom Lisa knew one them about me; I am *not liberal*. If she were to give me any thought these days, I'm sure she'd joke that I must be a Trump supporter. But what silly words to put down here! <- This is a good tell of today's strange condition.
