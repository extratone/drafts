# the classic swap
it's trivialities that turn a room
byproducts that catch eyes
niceties that ease pouts
but I swear I feel my breath leaking out
my eyes dim, ears dull

standing in my crooked way,
magnetic as ripe invention,
in possession of the nothing
so many want

The dead watch the living

as I had the affection
of a tether through any winter;
any weather,
warmed and invincible

why do you think I have attention to place
