Fascinating, how many words one will "write" in 2016 in comparison with the average human even thirty years ago.

I listened through most of WOLFPACK10's presentation on Fleet Commanding at Eve FanFest 2016, and was particularly stuck on the thought of his (claimed) "5000 messages a day" reality. I've downloaded WhatsApp, but see no way to link myself as a contact, so will be restricted to speaking to those who know my phone number. I do not think many do. Perhaps I should change that in the near future and make use of my phone more often.
