Xanath is the only individual to have created an *Extratone* account within the past few days. Alek's is the only staff piece at all so far.

A video has been circulating (it's a PSA, I think) of two girls breaking the window of a parked car to save the dog inside. Apparently, there's been significant discussion around it, though I do not have the bandwidth to check, really.

Last Adderall pill until the 14th, ingested. I seem to be lacking in the spelling department lately. Especially of really simple and commonly-used words. I don't know what's up with that. Perhaps too much time in *Eve*.

Unsurprisingly, I think everyone's regarding this as another *Inmunis*, and time alone will bring content. Can I wait? I guess so.
