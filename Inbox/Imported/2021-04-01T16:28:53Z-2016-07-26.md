Eryn cut her hair.

I spent one more night with her last night. I met her friend Mariel, then drove her back in her car (it's a miserable drive.) She watched me and kissed my cheek. There was a strange smell in her house, and she's been waking up with unexplained bruises. She suggested that a dark presence could be lurking there.

Together (sorta,) we came to the conclusion that **I am neutral/base**. I am very calming in such situations. She suggested that to be the reason why she's been okay with me around. That stung a bit, honestly, but it shouldnt've. I "like being [her] wall," but I am not much of a thrill, I guess. Though I think she is making an effort to fall in love with me, and that's very sweet.

Again - regardless of what we may or may not be to each other in the future, the past week has been very good for me. I've probably had the best sex I'll ever have. I've adored. I've been jealous. I've wondered, and I've been kissed & hugged.
