blessed is the spirit that is stealing under the sheets to sneak something - the urgency when it is not hers
blessed is the spirit without her - it could never overstay its welcome

blessed is every breath
and every observed happening - she is here to teach me.

maybe the goal should be to distill it down as far as
*I just know it's nicer when you're next to me*
