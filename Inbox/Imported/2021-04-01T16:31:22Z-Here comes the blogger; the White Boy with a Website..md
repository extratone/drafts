Here comes the blogger; the White Boy with a Website.
I'll bet he's on his way to crash the party. Except it's not just a party - it's the lifestyle of a whole bunch of pretty decent folks.
His Great Dane legs striding him uptown, his pouty mouth struggling to keep closed.
What's that he's got in his hand?
Oh, fuck... it's *ethics*.

I dug them out because I am awfully worried about you right now. I've just seen a man pay for a 3D printer with his wristwatch, yet the intellectuals of the day are still tossing around words like "truth" "morality" and "ethics" with universal assumptions.

Let's begin by making use of the tools available to us and define the three terms.

Truth - of course - is the shittiest one, but I'll be choosy here and note "a fact or belief that is accepted as true."

Morality's contains the most underlinable term in the whole mess: "a **particular** system of values and principles of conduct."

*None* of these words refer to creeds - they refer to systems of thought that make up the context in which creeds are furthered, discussed, decried, etc.

So when someone uses a sentence like "that's amoral," or "he's been accused of unethical practices," the intellectual response should be a request for specificity, should it not?
