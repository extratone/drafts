Unfortunately, it would seem I've neglected to modify the new Drynet's infrastructure the way I did years ago to allow direct file access into the wp-content/uploads folder. Are we talking about Jennifer Lawrence? Yeah.

Anyway, my upload of the stowaway.mp3 recording is inaccessible by all the methods I know.

I believe I've given Logan a copy of *Feebles*, but he doesn't seem very interested. Not surprising, of course, considering it's our first day working with each other in a year or so and I've spent hours spewing my usual pro-Rand diatribe.

I've also gone over some of the common misconceptions regarding voluntaryism, as is now nigh-obligatory after talking about Ayn Rand, it would seem.

We have new work shirts... I don't know if it's my current adderall high, but I am experiencing an urge to actually spend time writing about how ridiculous these shirts are. I've never before encountered such a terrible dress shirt, and hadn't expected to, considering that they are the cheapest component of any men's formal outfit. It's actually quite difficult to spend more than $40 on a button-down dress shirt, even at the highest tiers of consumer fashion.

I spent some time loving on Mariah from Dieselgoth today. I guess I felt like I should explain why I engage with her so much / say such irreverent things about her.
