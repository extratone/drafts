fury is words fleeing me
silent seething must be the destruction I forgot
gnashing rotten,
my rotted heart
such that I close again to the Earth
and that is not what I wanted.

If it's truly noble,
love's one exemption from my control,
it is disastrous.

I agreed to *burn*
but I fear the fire is now consuming me
whole
every moniker I'd cling to right me,
only fuel for its toll

Every sense that's taken me so long to brighten is now dulling again, I fear. At least there is a truth, perhaps: I must choose between life and love.
