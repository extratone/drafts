Dither?
Dither
Dither!

No! We cannot dither!
Scramble! Anything to get down! ANYTHING!
Foam off your lip righteous words they are many
Make as much of a fuss as you can!
that's what dad taught me
A man is only his Fuss
his legend, this made
Oh, *me!*
Joke, *me!*
always will be in the pissant cacophony

Not afraid enough to succeed
not hungry enough to ask for food in the street
Sky streets but left to lie and reap
my portion

*give give give and take*

*Der Kirschbaum sieht Kinder weg*

monocoqung thoughts lay when ya nail its peel array
shuffled
to
paste
& a rodent rid along
stamped the caste too many times to

Damn.
Why the fuck'd you let paternal poison in?
Damn.
Why the FUCKve'you gantried the lot to every girl in sovereignty?

Empty eyes, *SINK!*
Filthying wasted compressorghouls
redistributed prickles
hair & skin

I can't swim over it anymore

Fuck, you wear me out, you know?
a hastened etherslip here and there
barely recalled to witness pool again
