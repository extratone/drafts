It's funny to me that I'm about to begin the same cycle of behavior because of this new phone that I did with the last one - almost entirely around Meagan.

We were at her parent's house when I first downloaded this app, in fact. And I was playing Real Racing 3. And Pocket Planes. And I had an active Star Trek Online account sitting on the desktop at home, of course.

One might think I'm trying to keep it alive through proxy activities, but I think my behavior in those areas is just that stagnant, to be honest. It operates in cycles. I've said this before.

I think I've spent a year realizing how compatible Meagan and I are, actually. It's what one does during downtime that really counts, I think, and though my tendency to rest and veg may have simply come from depression, I really miss it. I had my own little world for awhile, and shared it with just Meagan. I think she enjoyed it, too, but perhaps realized that she couldn't afford to lounge.

Though I sound rational and healthy during the daylight hours with drugs in my system, I think there is a part of me that genuinely believes I have actually accomplished my ultimate goal in life. Even if it was just for a short bit, I had what I really want with Meagan. That's frightening, of course, but also comforting. I have less to lose than I have in my entire life. I suppose it could explain my pseudo-senile sentiments. I just miss her a lot. I really miss that girl.

I've always thought repetition in a private diary was silly, but I understand it now. I want to tell Meagan over and over again that I love and miss her and appreciate her but I can't. And I can't really vent it to anyone else, either.

Though one could make the case that her methods were cruel (I, of course, have no interest in doing so,) I have actually gained a lot of appreciation and respect for her in this time, rather than spite. I'm not sure if I should wish to hate her, but I never will. I wish I could at least see her face in person...or hear her voice. Those are still my strongest desires when the hours are wee and the other mechanisms resting.

I love that girl.

I love Meagan.

I hope that everything she wants comes to her.

And...on that note, I now officially have an appointment with the psychologist mom recommended on the 6th of November. I suppose I should begin working on a way to tell him things like this. What can he really say, though, or recommend? "Yeah, that's pretty fucking unhealthy. Work on stopping it." I, of course, am not that ignorant about the school of psychology and processes of therapy. I understand that the goal is usually to guide me in working it out myself. The trouble is, I'm not sure if I want to stop feeling for her. It's by far the most I've ever loved or cared about anyone. She was everything to me. I don't really know what I look like as an adult without my love for her. Knowing she was there made everything possible for me, emotionally. I just wish she would contact me. I think about it every day, and I have for nearly 11 months. I don't know what to do, but I hope therapy helps. (I think.)

((I'm actually deathly afraid of losing ANY bit of anything related to Meagan. It's the only thing I fear anymore.))
