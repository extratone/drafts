this summer has been the most emotional period of my life. another division: things I am afraid to miss/awareness or caring of missing.

ever an exploratory continuance, this. I am nearly always amused by myself. *what do you do?*, Travis asks. what *have* I been doing, is what he probably meant. since learning of Eryn's regression with Wally, I had been eating for days. I ate everything. it's a shame it was a waste and not a comfort - food's never done that for me in the slightest.

she pulled away from a kiss the last time we parted. we were relatively quiet - she was tired - but I empathize directly. though I am still very distracted by the whole thing. the fire has plateaued and is smoldering. sometimes the hot coal kind, yeah. off Adderall, I'm nearly "normal." that is, unoccupied and uncaring. and that is why I was more furious with her than I've ever been at anything: fear she had ruined a won'drous dream. and as I find out that she needn't be honest with me, and could've been exaggerating the whole thing, I am angered at it and myself.

she says *it's not making love* and I wouldn't disagree. that's the worst bit: we've been making nothing. wasting. astonishing that I would ever find myself perpetuating such a thing.

fucking KOed, my affection, I'm afraid. wounded severely. though there was little hope, what was wanes deeply.

and I am left with fewer and fewer things. or - if we're worried about blame - *I leave*

I have started to lose my ability to speak, so employment is evermore a necessity.

If this is how it's going to be, I must find other reasons to be with Eryn. (if I'm fighting for a future, anyway.)

but I know how to do this now, second time around? spread myself out. return to *other* and its beauty. take strength in destitution - though I do not have Brent, now. I guess we'll see how much I really needed him.

perhaps the most pervading maintenance: remain amused. money will help with that. perhaps a more versatile passion is my next evolution, but at this point, there is nothing against a short wait.
