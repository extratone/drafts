### Acoustic Performance

Declared noise emission values in accordance with ECMA-109

Sound Power Level
    *L* *W* A,m (B) Sound Pressure Level    Operator Position

    *L* *p* A,m (dB)

Idle 1.40 ( *K V* = 0.25) 6.0   Wireless web 1.40 ( *K V* = 0.25) 6.5     

1. *L* *W* A,m is the mean A-weighted sound power level, rounded to the nearest 0.05 B.
2. *L* *p* A,m is the mean A-weighted sound pressure level measured at the operator position (rounded to the nearest 0.5 dB).
3. 1 B (bel) = 10 dB (decibel)
4. *K v* is the statistical adder for computing upper-limit of A-weighted sound power level.
5. The quantity, *L* *W* A,c (formerly called *L* *W* Ad) may be computed from the sum of *L* *W* A,m and *K v*.
6. The Wireless web test browses 25 popular websites.
7. Configuration tested: 2.5GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB memory, 512GB storage, Intel Iris Pro, AMD Radeon R9 M370X.

1. 1GB = 1 billion bytes and 1TB = 1 trillion bytes; actual formatted capacity less.
2. Weight varies by configuration and manufacturing process.
3. Testing conducted by Apple in April 2015 using preproduction 2.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7–based 15-inch MacBook Pro systems with 256GB of flash storage and 16GB of RAM. The wireless web test measures battery life by wirelessly browsing 25 popular websites with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or 75%. The HD movie playback test measures battery life by playing back HD 1080p content with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or 75%. The standby test measures battery life by allowing a system, connected to a wireless network and signed in to an iCloud account, to enter standby mode with Safari and Mail applications launched and all system settings left at default. Battery life varies by use and configuration. See [www.apple.com/batteries](https://www.apple.com/batteries/) for more information.
4. iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are available on the Mac App Store. Downloading apps requires an Apple ID and a device that is compatible with the OS version required for each app.
