# Enpass for iOS App Store Review
![](Enpass%20for%20iOS%20App%20Store%20Review/Photo%20Mar%2024,%202021%20at%20014216.jpg)

I've praised Enpass for years, most recently [on my blog](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts) and subsequently [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1253384547405791235). As someone who's been using password managers since the oughts, I can tell you with some authority that Enpass - as a cross-platform, cloud sync-enabled method of managing your credentials - remains pretty darn good.

I, myself, have become far too dependent on Enpass to move until I deem it absolutely necessary, but I debated recommending it over current popular competitors (Lastpass) as well as old school entires (1Password, which is notably the only other password manager I've used) for new users because of recent changes to the desktop app's UI (menus??) and not-quite-as-silky-smooth operation of the iOS app, but I expect this is simply a low point in the cycle, and Enpass will once again reach a point where it's the prettiest, once again.

I really only have one request for the iOS team, and it likely only applies to me: **keyboard shortcut integration**. I have begun to suspect I might be the only iPhone user in its history to make extensive use of hardware keyboard integration, but I have to say, 1Password's support of the âŒ˜+F shortcut to bring the cursor to the search bar after FaceID/TouchID/general authentication would be an *incredibly* helpful addition to the Enpass iOS app. I would be very interested in hearing about how difficult such keyboard shortcut implementation is in iOS development, generally, also.

Thanks!
