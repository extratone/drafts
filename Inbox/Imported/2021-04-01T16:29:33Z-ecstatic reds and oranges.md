ecstatic reds and oranges
bright but I can't comment on technique
dazers in their bizarring pauses
on wary's abandoning squares
and miniatures of things you over and over again
think
shouldn't be

away from it all I am quaint with missiles
and I like both their represented strokes
and their monstrous reality

and the marshall's careful poultry walkers alter my trajectory more than himself
