You'd think I would've anticipated the progressively more-personal nature of these letters. As awful as it is, I actually said "*Extratone* **is** me," recently, and I wasn't being dishonest.

This one is big. Somehow, there are *milestones* now, and they - quite suddenly - feel very intimate.

We passed 100 total posts just last week, which seems a desperately small number when I consider that I have now - without doubt - expended more time and energy shipping a God Damned WordPress website than I ever have into any other one thing. (89 Î¿f them are mine.)

How's THAT for an admission?!

I don't think I fully realized the extent of my emotional involvement until my friend Ammnontet - out of the blue - complimented the site. https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/774662833636188160
I know him well enough to respect his opinion and was therefore very highly complimented. Maybe even *stirred*? This viscous soul?!

Episode 6 of *The New* was by far the most acceptable yet. The youths were unusually well-behaved and therefore able to pass their unique insight much more easily. For those of you that enjoy our particular rowdiness, *Off The Grid* has been extracted and given its own iTunes-spiffed RSS feed, meaning there are now three *Extratone* "podcasts" to choose from on That Unholy Aggregator which is still the best way to consume them??
