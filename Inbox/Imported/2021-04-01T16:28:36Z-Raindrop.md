[Raindrop.io 5.0Last major update of web apps happen many years ago, internally they aged really bad: slow, inflexible and hard to extend. They need complete refresh! Today I'm very excited to launch what I have been working on for the past half of the year!](https://medium.com/raindrop-io/raindrop-io-5-0-c146c4770bc6)

I'm not sure I've ever gone from finding out about a service's existence to becoming a paid subscriber of said service as fast as I did with Raindrop.

* It should probably be somewhat alarming that the [official blog](https://medium.com/raindrop-io)'s last post was from March.

* Not just an "All-in-one bookmark manager" but in fact a **curatorial tool**.

* Had difficulty parsing HTML exports from the Discord Reading List, which is understandable.

* I suppose I *would* love implementation of keyboard shortcuts, but I completely understand how miniscule that must seem in the modern developer's mind.

	* Well I'll be darned! Keyboard shortcuts are [a "planned" addition](https://raindropio.canny.io/feature-requests/p/keyboard-shortcuts--quick-jumps) as of this moment!

## Archiving

That is... *scraping* and/or *capturing* the contents of one's bookmarked webpages as thoroughly as possible.

* Notably - separate from Google Search's caching and Safari's localizing Reading List - Raindrop's page capturing process seems to be designed to craft the "Permanent Copy" final product to be as indistinguishable from its living web counterpart as possible, almost like archive.org's.

## Curating

## Republishing

## Suggestions/Wish List

* The ability to add descriptions and/or other metadata to public collections would definitely add some context for anyone who just stumbles across them.

* ...as would custom URLs for public collections, but I realize that's probably a very big ask.

* You are now known as Plum Snipe.
