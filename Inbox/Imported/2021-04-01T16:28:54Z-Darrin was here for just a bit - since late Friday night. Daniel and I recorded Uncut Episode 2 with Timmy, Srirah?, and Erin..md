Darrin was here for just a bit - since late Friday night. Daniel and I recorded *Uncut* Episode 2 with Timmy, Srirah?, and Erin.

Anna and I have been talking over Facebook Messenger. She lives in St. Joseph, now, and I told her I'd come up this Tuesday morning.

I am not sure if I should prepare by more-clearly defining how I feel about Anna or not.

Friday night, I hung out with Daniel and Marmar[the manager of Natural Grocers] for a good while before we went to the roof of the parking garage closest to campus to hacky. After getting home, I slept a full night, I think, and then ended up falling asleep around 2030 last night, and sleeping until 1100 today. Despite having taken 40 mg of adderall since, I am distinctly out of words.
