defining *indulgence*
haphazard genius
reckless winters,
when I am loved.

titleless spells over a concrete prairie
cinched by the whole truth

my muses, dandily
must be kept about my room

when I run out of pills, I am left nothing
but sleeping, consumption, and lifeless wanting

before eating one again
and another, depending on the feeling

and the corpse is reanimated
jolted awake, away
made breathing
but its breath is fowl as the dead
and its eyes - on close inspection -
without blue; vacantly gray

tired of words and time
and everyone else
