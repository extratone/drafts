wiggled[changed by typo to "wigged] into conductivity
the boundaries,
widening till eventual present
(still, of course, but the horizon's travel is harder to witness the further it progresses)

We united around a fogged apparition of security
and have learned of their multiplicity in the years since

legends, scheduled daily
depicted monstrosities bellowing toward each of us

*pikemen, redcoats*

never a tangible description,
but they'd do their best
and conclude by opening the window - despite the cold - so that we may hear them,
rumbling
coming

I'd made my brain enough to be conscious of its expansion
my instrument
it, too, was moving
and occuredly,
toward *them*

And I waited, anxious
to hear a crash
of tremendous closing velocity
and then quiet?

But it must've passed through them
like breath
and continued on
leaving Flander's land
where my monsters - I assume - 
live on
