neglected hygiene is a prime indicator of amphetamine abuse.
but what is a shower when I have a voice?
what if I'm given a solution but can't escape the wetness in time to write it down?
and I forget

I do not want any more stories that are *a shame*
paralysis is *a shame*

if by word *only*, I will not die *a shame*
remember: I've been feeling death's breath on the back of my neck for months, now
brushing my teeth can wait.
