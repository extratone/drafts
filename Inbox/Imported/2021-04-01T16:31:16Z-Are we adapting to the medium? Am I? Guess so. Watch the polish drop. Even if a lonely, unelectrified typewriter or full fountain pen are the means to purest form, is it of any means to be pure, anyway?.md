Are we adapting to the medium? Am I? Guess so. Watch the polish drop. Even if a lonely, unelectrified typewriter or full fountain pen are the means to purest form, is it of any means to be pure, anyway?

If these are truths, pure is awfully slow, and life is awfully short.

Yeah, I spent a good time in the analog last year, thinking that the slowness would require my mind to finally order itself. I'm not sure I really gained, though. I'm not so sure these days if I didn't lose.
