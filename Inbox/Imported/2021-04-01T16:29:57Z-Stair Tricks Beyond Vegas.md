# Stair Tricks: Beyond Vegas
Who is Justin Lin? I know J.J.'s face. I know he needs a hat because his lenses are always flaring. His Lenses, which have he has so meticulously set upon fair Gene's ancient property - the one which has been with me far more consistently than any other.

Yes, I have been using the term "touchstone" recently, as I have been in a bit of a crises. (Hopefully not a mid-life one.) I believe a worthy preface for this text is this: Star Trek has been an unquestionable touchstone for me. Truthfully, it has made me cry more than anything on-screen, and blogging is - as far as I can make out - mostly confessional, so we're doin good. I'm sure I'll find more opportunities to lament on its presence in my life, but be assured: it is probably heavier in my life than in yours. For better or worse, confrontational or not, it is *likely* the truth.

To begin, let's get some unoriginal restatement out of the way: *Star Trek Beyond* is not altogether exploratory, so yeah... it is *beyond* very little.
