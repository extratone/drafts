Seen the sky in a few
enough to know it's weak in me
The airman's religion is as close as I come to a system of ethics, I suppose
My people fly
I have always been too tired, honestly, but I can't be hefted heavenward at this moment, certainly
Come to think of it, I do not think I can allow myself to die before flying again
But what will it be, really, After?
What if I am a waste of fuel?

What if Her song is too loud?
What if I cannot hear the airplane?

At least it would be something else to be crushed about,
not that it is independent
My plans hold true; it is all in connection
