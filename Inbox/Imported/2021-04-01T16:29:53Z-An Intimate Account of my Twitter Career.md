# An Intimate Account of my Twitter Career
I created my first Twitter account on June 20th, 2009, apparently just to Tweet "Watching Jimmy!" It'd only be reasonable to delete such an embarrassing confession, were it not so amusing and (believe it or not) personally-monumental. I still do not know which Jimmy I was watching. I have not put significant effort into the recollection, though, as there are many Jimmies. I was 15 years old and newly-emancipated from the secluded circumstances of my childhood, doing my best to understand my place in the culture. Apparently, I believed for at least a moment that it involved late night television.

Twitter is significant to me because I've interacted with it in some manner nearly every day since, and I am *not* what is commonly called "a creature of habit" by any estimation. One could surmise that my tendency to wander is out of an acute caution regarding emotional investment. There can be no doubt though: I am emotionally invested in Twitter. The fact is especially prevalent given the recent reminder of the service's mortality. Its financial feasibility as a business is in more severe doubt than ever, and I am therefore in duress.

and I have interacted with the service in some manner every day since.
