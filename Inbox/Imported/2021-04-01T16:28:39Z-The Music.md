# The Music
Though festgoers and participating indie developers were all dominantly comfortable in their casual attire, the musicians present at the festival maintained a refreshing digibohemian theatre that acutely compartmentalized them as purposed presenters.

Perhaps the most anticipated happening for our troop was the Party2012 show, scheduled and relegated to the "potentially obnoxious DJ" allotment of a secondary Gaylord hallway.

*Music is technically a banned topic for me, but these are my friends.*
