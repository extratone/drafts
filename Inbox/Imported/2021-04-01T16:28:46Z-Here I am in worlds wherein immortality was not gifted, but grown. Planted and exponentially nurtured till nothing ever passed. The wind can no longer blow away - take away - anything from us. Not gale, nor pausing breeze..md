Here I am in worlds wherein immortality was not gifted, but grown. Planted and exponentially nurtured till nothing ever passed. The wind can no longer blow away - take away - anything from us. Not gale, nor pausing breeze.
If there's peace in ignorance, there is no peace.
If there's love in war, we are all alone.

If I'm to be one, taken; if I am one to draw instringent artifacts from their clayburned berth, I am plotted against destitution of centuries;
I accept thy duel with bone.
