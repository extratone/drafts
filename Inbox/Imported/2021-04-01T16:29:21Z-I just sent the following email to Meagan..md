I just sent the following email to Meagan.

Meagan,

Please forgive me if my attempts to contact you illicit distress. I understand if you don't have the room in your life right now, but I'd really love to talk with you. Perhaps we could over coffee sometime? Or text, even.

In retrospect, the messages I've sent have been as pitiful as my father's one-way conversations with me over the years. If you feel the same about me as I do about him, I can understand why a response doesn't seem like a productive use of your time. To be honest, I'm not sure you have anything to gain from me.

I also have to confess that I miss you as much as I did a year ago. I haven't been able to go a day without thinking about you. I don't expect it's been the same for you, but that's okay. I've had a lot of time to arrive at peace with it. If anything, I now take joy in the image of you continuing in your life in happiness.

If you're still reading, I'm assuming you're curious enough to wonder why I'm contacting you again.

I know you well enough to know this language is probably really strange/crazy to you, but you know me well enough to know that it's true.

Since I last saw you, I've done a lot, and met a lot of people, and I do not exaggerate when I say that I've found them all intolerable in comparison to you and your family. I had no idea how precious rationality was, I suppose. I miss Erin & Adam and even your mom tremendously. I'm not sure if they influenced my preferences or if I was just too young to understand them, but I do.

Several months ago, I realized that if I knew I was going to die in an hour, I would spend it making every effort to say I love you again.

Isn't that strange? Like... It's not like I've never told you. Yet I am certain of it.

Of course, I thought I was crazy, but that would've been too easy. Unfortunately, I think it's because I love you. You are still my favorite collection of molecules by far.

I've gotten us into quite a mess.

In reflection, some of the things I said to you absolutely abhor me, and the thought of all the ridiculous pressures and stresses I put you through brings me to tears.

I also know that my love probably has little worth to you in and of itself. And I don't mean that in passive-aggressive self-pity... I mean it literally and frankly.

What is self-pitiful, probably, is that all my experiences have done is prove again and again that you are still what's important to me. I don't think it's in a relationship sense, necessarily, but I can't be certain at this point. I do know that is it I that owe you, not vice versa. A whole ocean of apologies, if nothing else.

I know it's slimey to circumvent your blocks... I hope I don't really disgust you that much. I don't want to bother you, but the thought of never speaking to you again is my only remaining fear in life, and it scares me to death.
