why am I puffing?
when it is *not nice*

Nicotine addiction is a fascinating thing
and essential, I think, to understanding one's mortality

yes, I do recommend that you, everyone, try it
for a season,
maybe
no more,
necessarily

observe its depth in your intellect;
its most cunning influence on daily intents

I have abused a good many substances,
and none's were anything like it

should you oblige,
make full use of the time
prod it with *impossible*
