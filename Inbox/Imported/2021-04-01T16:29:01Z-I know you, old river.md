I know you, old river
we'd come by and straddle
when Autumn asked
my memory, frozen at sunset
the concrete melancholy
I was too young to know so well

I was allowed its exhaustion,
but I had some other love,
then

my heart and I were tossed around
by the pictures we saw on those journeys - the little towns and their old things
the lights in gravely constance from diesel locomotives and elevator towers

and still most always
a little ball of reverence, somehow

but my heat is here - right now - up to something
it's your Chanel coming off my chest, I guess

I could've sworn I saw a ghost of that little boy,
but I've withheld rest from myself lately,
the mind begins to mean less and less.

that little boy who taught himself to love *things*
and always live in his grandness because he
anticipated and aspired.

how long it has been since that little boy died!
and I am still here by youth's biology and nothing else

I remember enough - he'd be disgusted
but he's not watching
even ghosts
