Use your knowledge of people and their tendencies to gain a foothold. Use your fascination with human behavior as an aide to keep you interested in the game - get yourself some momentum and hang on to it.

Don't let yourself become a martyr to ignorance.

"Proving something to yourself."

Don't self-destruct in an effort to prove you are better than everyone to yourself.

-Build David Blue. Make him invincible before it's too late. Stop being so open about yourself in public forums out of an enthusiasm to share. Make people have to work to get to know you. In private, polish. Fucking polish. Discipline. Physical discipline, if necessary. Nothing crazy, but it must be followed through. You must restrict your friends. You must be your only one. You must move all meaty dialogue to discussion with yourself until your public stand on any given issue can be determined. You must become an expert on body language. You must analyze yourself.

Up to this point, revealing yourself has been an experiment. Some of your ideas are public. What have the reactions been?

How much restriction will be required?  What will you stand by? What will you attribute to youthful ignorance?

-A methodological approach - or as close to one as possible - in all aspects of life. Make lists. Determine the privacy risk for all of them.

People claim to revere openness, but they have preference. The data has shown so far that the majority does not prefer you. You must be more cautious from now on.

Meeting Michael is a good opportunity for damage control.

From now on, you are not a voluntaryist. Are you a moderate liberal? How deep does it go? Ideas? Regurgitation? Principle? Morals, even?

Can I appear enthusiastic in my blog posts about sociopathy? Can I be amoral in the name of media?

Stop biting your nails. Stop picking your nails.

Make this your Frank Underwood moment. Learn from him. "Never again..."

What do you want? Define it. Conceptualize it. Visualize it. Make it happen.

You need a new piece of jewelry, but first, a set of words to define this start. Someone you truly respect - Charles Lindbergh. He is someone you loved before her. Tie this to him. Remind yourself of what you must do.

"To dust I will return."

"Nothing is forever, except us."
