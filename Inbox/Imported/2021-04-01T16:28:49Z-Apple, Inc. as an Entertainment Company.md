## Transcript
At some point it was decided I don't know if it was them or us or both it was decided at some point that Apple Inc. up is was is a lifestyle company I am I can look that up I'm sitting here and in front of me is my surface laptop to you on it posit 10 minutes 52 seconds and is the Billie Eilish movie Billie Eilish the worlds a little more blurry on Apple TV+ arm and it's not is it it is important to talk about this in a fucking phone review why well I am because when you buy the phone you a year of Apple TV+ free which is same reason why in this fucking fun of you we also had to talk about Apple Arcade And whatever it was for the term Kim about lifestyle company I am it's it's an interesting dynamic because I am just thinking I don't know who I am I don't know what level to put on myself because I have both been a air zealous I've been a salad for him and also my original take videos I just acknowledge myself as an apple or just so strange because that was such a refund of the time and I've never acknowledged and seen the word Apple nerd with all the stuff considering that it's designed specifically not to be nerdy is that an interesting dynamic as it's as funny as how the word iPhone or the term iPhone power user is gone from being an oxymoron to a well still funny but I think that exist Not even necessarily a rare thing but anyway I am I guess if I was doing it if I was making a computer company if I was making hardware I wouldn't want any part of us and I think that one of the reasons why we don't have fanboys so much anymore in the Apple versus no Apple thing is because we have realize that it's like comparing apples to oranges ha ha Ha all of them I will just is unique still in not just the truth of what they are the business by and what they want to be basically I'm just St. Luke's I don't think that Samsung wants to be a lifestyle company I am and I think of it maybe the rest of the industry that's it still looks at Apple and I just kind a like well that's fucking weird I am anyway Reviewing the purpose of reviewing the whole thing as an experience I guess literally for the future and look back on I would say that I have not been I've not been interesting experience in the clinical lifestyle out I haven't been living it on since all those early iPhone years I am and I did for a while I have a 2008 MacBook as my PC is my computer I am that was once but most of the time most of my life I've had a Windows PC and an Apple headset and I want someone buy that are under the simple justification of all of your phone you don't wanna take it like you have your phone be a Tinkertown what you W really yeah is a air but your computer right now you do you want your bill to be open and capable of doing whatever so I ran and grab your phone you need to be solid and elegant and I have a teaser experience for you robust thoughtful and reserved I am but none of that applies to leave or are you just I guess what I'm trying to do here is figure out how much of that all stigma is true and what it means going forward for consumer technology a and brand look like with the brand name anyway I am I think though and I think we can agree looking at the Apple TV thing arm because lifestyle company is one thing becoming an entertainment company media company is one thing I think I am Apple is a media company a in a very particular way of it again no one is trying to compete with them because the app stories and man in their own little environments a Apple news But I think they've they figured out their place as life as a computer company as a lifestyle company and as a little in a small way to meet a company but this thing as an entertainment company though I think we've all been like I think you're over stretching yourself I don't think you can I don't think you're ready for this I don't think that it's what you need to be doing granted there's so huge that they're really reach that point where they might they just keeps going with Olivia well we might as well try anything but I am that's also really privileged position anyway a I don't think it's gonna work the other Tameka thing arm which isn't all that important to but looking at all Like, this like the Apple TV application the software on my mom's Samsung smart TV compared to the rest of the apps Native and third-party is so much better it's so much nicer looking and solid and smooth and it's it's much faster and it's perfect except except for the content him and I just of saying all this because I think here is an instance where Apple needs to be a computer company again a need to go back to being with computer company the software company And acknowledge what we don't know the first thing about making movies but damn we can go back and just make the softer use to stream as babies and because the what I would love is if I don't need what's on Apple TV at all there's nothing there basically but I'd love it if the platform arm was what actually underpin all the other streaming services but I have so I guess it's my comment was just apples in there and same company this is some dynamic there I just don't think it's gonna work and I'm sorry Tim him but I really don't think you believe that you're gonna lose you're not missing anything Apple Inc. hilarious that I'm talking about this

## Apple vs. Google
> This has been the tension forever: can Google figure out hardware before Apple figures out services?  
-David Pierce on *The Vergecast*, [October 24, 2014](https://pca.st/episode/87067910-3dad-0132-c588-5f4c86fd3263)

Hilariously, 7 years later, I think the truth is that neither has really figured their respective new avenues. Stadia sounds like one hell of a deal - especially for someone like me, who’s main computers have basically zero GPU performance - but 20 minutes in to my first F1 practice session, all of the sudden, reality broke down, inputs lagged into like 10 second latency, and I fucking crashed.

Apple TV+ is an excitingly beautiful experience in every way except content. (Which is debatably the most important aspect of streaming services?? I’m not sure if I’ve yet figured out which is most important to me, personally.)
