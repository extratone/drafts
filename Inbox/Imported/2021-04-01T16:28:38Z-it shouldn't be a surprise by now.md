it shouldn't be a surprise by now
urgency dissipated by something in the water

I am inexhaustibly compelled to clarify
all manner of confusion,
misconceptions,
convenient illusions
(or otherwise)

temptation is in my pocket and
as I breathe in and out,
coming down,
I attempt Discipline again
that fickle mistress who only destroys all Me
despite decades of otherwised advisory

that is,
the Me I know

yet I must promise to indulge her out of guilt
for I am and have been *costing*

the journals; these Bibles
(biblical-looking things)
which I would have bequeathed to Her
in a pitiful last testament,

they are (or must be)
my attempt to continue correspondence with
(to archive it)
my companion who was and would be

they could be to blame for my slowing;
this approach to some Nothing
which I do my best,
pharmacologically,
to stay
