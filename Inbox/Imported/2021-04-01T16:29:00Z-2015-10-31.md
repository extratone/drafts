The sickness of inspecificity.

It's the holiday where everyone competes on how big of a fool they can make of themselves. Perhaps I am bitter because it exemplifies how bitter I am.

"I am everything and nothing" is a really good descriptor of me, I think. I wonder if my "appreciation for variety" is actually just a lack of identity, as opposed to BEING my identity. I'd like to think it's all figured out, though. I'm too old for an identity crisis.
