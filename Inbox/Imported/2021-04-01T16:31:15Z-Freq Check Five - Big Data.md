Five.

I've just finished rendering Episode 54 of *Drycast* after sitting on the raw files for 10 months. It wouldn't be inappropriate to suggest my hesitance was out of fear of the end of the all.

Due to my own absences, October has so far been fairly quiet. Episode 11 of *The New* was quite delayed, and we experienced our first extended (24 hour) downtime two days ago as a result of a few slippery php errors. Let me apologize to you now for both leniencies; neither are becoming of our purpose.

There's something really cool about "All Systems Operational" in *The Verge*'s footer. Perhaps I feel that way because I am - ultimately - a child.

The most mentionable change these past weeks is **female contribution**!

Xanath's "Could Education Suck?" represents the first female words *and* contains the first Spanish text on *Extratone*!

On the listenable side, the beautiful voices of Nina and Ivy Hollivana [link to *Off The Grid* debate episode] have both graced the digital airwaves of *Studio Eat* once more.

I'd be flattered if you recalled the sparsely posted works in **Prose** during our genesis, but I don't expect it, by any means. In my search for contributors, though, I've found that poetry is in fact the dominant prospective offering, which is both exciting and beguiling. I have hesitated to emphasize creative contributions because it's seemed a bit inappropriate as a primary content focus. Poetry on the front page just doesn't feel quite right, ya know?

There's also the whole *why* thing. After some thought, I realized that platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, Medium, Blogger, etc. are less perfect vehicles of verse than they've seemed, simply because of The Largest Taboo in the business: *intellectual property*. One day soon, I shall be able to proclaim with utter confidence that your original content is attributed more optimally on *Extratone* than on any other free service, which can (in theory) claim ownership of any/all work you "give" them. Considering our ~$15,000 deficit, formal legal counsel is fleeting, perhaps, but an evermore pertinent concern as our staff and readership increase. Before May 2017 (*Extratone*'s first birthday,) the trademarking process will have begun, and fine print drafted. Legal issues are some of the most foreign to me, so if you've any suggestions, I'd very much appreciate your correspondence.

Considering this future security with our new typography and ever-evolving design, though, I  have been tempted to more actively publish and acknowledge poetry
