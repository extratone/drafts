**Brain Shivers**
I think I see the same pain and things around me he was clackin on about some decades ago,
but it's funny, now,
because the only belief to be had is vague misnomered habits on the *evolved* or a smidge of pepper on belief,
altogether

But if GodDamned progress or bust, I'll get there not by mission, but by habit
and inevitables

*Oops!*

I just wrote a bunch of words instead of endeavoring to replenish my anti-depressants
(There are three left. I will not have money for ten days.)
I have heard of *brain shivers*,
and would not like to try them
but my doctor hasn't
so I guess I'll be fine,
then

And in the middle of it all here I am
must-writing
because I feel my time ticking away
and must howl over that titanic number
I somehow regularly forget

Loud enough so that somebody will pay me
to shut the fuck up

Enough,
maybe
for my pills
