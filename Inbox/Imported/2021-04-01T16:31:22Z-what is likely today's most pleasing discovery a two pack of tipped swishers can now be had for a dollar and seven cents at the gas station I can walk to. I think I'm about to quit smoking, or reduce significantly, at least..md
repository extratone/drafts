what is likely today's most pleasing discovery: a two pack of *tipped* swishers can now be had for a dollar and seven cents at the gas station I can walk to. I think I'm about to quit smoking, or reduce significantly, at least.

anyway, you'd think such a lack of *all* apparent motion would be driving me berserk. perhaps it is. as mom seems to now know most of the time, though, I am always making some sort of progress. my thoughts are never the same. this tattoo... again, it is truth. a truth that is both burden & blessing.

Eryn's presence and/or (perhaps) Brent's absence has allowed me to *so* much better see what surrounds me. that has been one of this summer's major themes. it's been a pause.

I don't think, though, that it's rational to look upon the past fondly, necessarily, or at least in the way we seem to seek. sensation is in the present only. when I thought I was reminiscing on Meagan & I, I could've only been wishing. I am still capable of wishing for her, but it is so very distant now. further and forevermore, it would seem that thought on her will be controlled. it's awfully poetic, but for the first time ever, I actually *forgot* how to play Meagan's song for a good moment. it was surreal: it's always been my favorite melody.

and even after Eryn & I's falling apart (or lapse, perhaps,) her song is a joyful one. I suspect it will always be so.

just since the beginning of June, I've loved that girl more than I've ever loved. I've been more angry with her than I've ever been with anyone. I've been closer to her than I've ever been with anyone. she's hit me so hard that I wonder if I'll ever stop reeling, and that - by all standards of measure, really - is a good thing.

it's been divine, my unraveling. my peacemaking.

the things from boyhood to which I have so stubbornly clung have been falling away. I am more and more what you'd call *healthy*, every day.

this clinging has made a good portion of my identity, I think. it's what's made me bitter and funny, so if this process should continue, I'll be different, I'm assuming. I don't regret it, but I am sorry if I cease to provide something for you. I think, though, that what I can provide now more than ever is counsel. this "seniority" to which I've been referring is at prime usability, so feel free to ask for advice. I think I'm best at that.

as I'm sure you know, I've been writing a lot. *Feebles* seems very far behind, though it's only been since March. I've just received 20 copies of the most perfect revision (as far as I know, it was only a single character away from "spotlessness.") I plan to sell & sign them in front of Columbia's Yellow Dog Bookshop before the summer's up.

The vast majority of what I've written recently has been reflectory, but I did place a (http://extratone.com/inred/averagedapparitions) preview of *Averaged Apparitions* on *Extratone*. It's a bit manifesto-esque, but it's the most recent sample of my publish-bound work available. rather abruptly, I seem to have found my "voice." it's definitely clearer. have you noticed?

as to *Extratone* itself, I hope you know that - while it is significant in encompassing everything - I continue it mostly because *I can*. there's no need to pity me for its lack of "success." it's ridiculously easy to maintain such a thing these days, so a good bit of my case for it is *why not*. I will continue putting time & effort into it because 1) it is good practice for any personally-suitable future career and 2) I still have a fairly-original mission & standard for which I do enjoy slaving away.

my time with Eryn has agitated an already present, semi-dormant itch for the educational ideal. aspiring to teach at some point has been making more and more sense. I've always enjoyed mentorship, so the pursuit of qualification has been on my mind.

I've been more emotional this summer than I've ever been in life, so I've been doing my best to let an appropriate amount of it seep into my public discourse. if you're interested in helping me, it seems I've entered a bit of a rut with this piece on the future of memory. you're all intelligent folk; if it inspires thought, please do not hesitate to share.

also remember that if you're reading this, I love you and will always be glad to hear from you in any capacity. I don't know if this kind of thing will be regular, or ever occur again, but I shall certainly remain infinitely-accessible, should you want or need me.

love,

Δaviδ Blue
