Waiting for Burnt and Kaleb outside the natty pad.
The Miata is dirty because I don't have any money....because I don't have a job.

I've been listening to Keith Jarrett - Rio (Part V especially)

Probably around 4 hours of sleep last night. Meagan is beautiful.

Drank dark coffee immediately before coming.
It erases almost all signs of sleep deprivation - excluding random pains and spasms throughout my body.
I wonder if this application crops the iPhone's photos.

I had been addicted to PocketPlanes, but I feel like my time is better spent writing.

About the job thing....applied at CASR yesterday. The neighborhood kids are playing some sort of game behind me. It reminds me how bad I am with children.
I wonder if I'll be able to keep up this journal thing, and I wonder if it is any benefit to me at all.
I'm probably only updating it now because I'm high on coffee.

Also, it's quite hot sitting here with the top up. Ha. You can see the temperature in this entry. Funny.
