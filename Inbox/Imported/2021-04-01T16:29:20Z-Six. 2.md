Six.

I have now spent half a year doing my best to incentivize a community of talented futurists into being. I have been Webmaster, Mentor, Data Warden, Entrepreneurial Hermit and Foe. I have descended into tremendous debt and premature senility. I have forsaken as many of my bitter old quips for newfound knowledge as has been feasible, and it looks like I'll only be getting softer. I have begun many friendships, and strengthened plenty of existing ones.

And if you've actually kept up with my rambling... thank you. I hope that if you're dug-in this far, you've taken advantage of our Discord, or found some other rewarding method to engage.

To my staff and contributors, I am tautly beholden. Though we are ad-free, our business is undeniably audience-driven, so to the rest of the readership, I must extend a gargantuan thanks.

I have begun to wonder if my prayers to the Sun have actually begun stirring up some sort of divine processes, because an awful lot of loose ends have been rectified these past weeks.

In reflection, I realize that just my personal growth because of this endeavor has been more extraordinary than any I've previously experienced.

Apparently, human infants don't usually begin speaking until 18-24
