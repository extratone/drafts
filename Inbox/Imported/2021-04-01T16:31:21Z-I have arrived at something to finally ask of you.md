I have arrived at something to finally ask of you
I have an idea as to how I can first experience pride

By my own two hands, I made myself
without support from one soul,
familial, societal, or in friendship

By my own design, I converged at my Want
as a toddler, though I was unable and uninterested in expressing it

I chose to as much as possible, live with an airy room in mind
and I would fill the room with Her
and it would be voluntarily agreed upon by both sides
and we would be *better than them*.

A hierarchy of preference would occur and we would be more *together* than perhaps any others in history

Privvy exclusively to secrets that not necessarily need exist, even
It is in the togetherness
It is not dependence
It is mutual convergence
and through it, we would prosper

And then Her happened
and though She was wholly new to me,
I loved so much everything to learn
and in loving,
learned the preciousness of difference
and when she left and severed It,
I was blinded to the center of the two ovals
their two became six billion
and they meet each other at each star in the unobstructed out-of-the-way night

I am in awe!
And still here,
I've time to widen my eyes to their clustered light
and they would provide you the comfort you seek
if you'd only stray a bit
strain your neck just a bit

Not I, of course,
and that is why I can never take would could've been my place
and chastise blindness
for my *origin* was out-of-way!

My youngest night sky was clearest this side of the Rockies!

But night and day,
I was dreaming and growing
Her and what meaning of what I'd live

And I would never trade my four years of Her face
for eighty with the night sky

That is for you,
not I
