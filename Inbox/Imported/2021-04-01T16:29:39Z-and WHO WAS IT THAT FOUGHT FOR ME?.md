and WHO WAS IT THAT FOUGHT FOR ME?
THE *ONE* WHO FENDED OFF DISEASE
WHEN I COULD NOT SEE?

WHO CARRIED ME ACROSS *COUNTRIES*
WHEN I WAS BROKEN,
*gleaming* in sun and starlight,
**proud of me.**

who never once left my side
when I had nothing

who was relentlessly True
in pointing my way
when I was so achingly lost

who silently took the blows
I burst in occasional last resort

who -
through more than every single other -
is
and
has been
WITH ME
