maybe I would come,
swaying,
then bobbing down,
through a terrace garden,
into the wide-open house we'd build,
splaying easels

I'd leave no choice but to be bathed in the sun -
rinse me over and over again;
I didn't know any better, then

staying for my first long visit with the sea;
I knew Her name belonged in the sand,
because it means *pearl*
that is,
*unlikely to be ever found again*

I walked through time indiscriminately -
miles and miles.
