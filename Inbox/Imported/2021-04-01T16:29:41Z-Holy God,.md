Holy God,
I am in it now
Nothing but incomprehensibly-sturdy structure
To support nothing
Or very little

Every young woman walking by is pretty in the sun
Today is a bit *too* pretty

I don't mean there is objectively nothing to them,
Of course
But for myself, little to offer,
If I had to guess

But what do I know?

Everybody said something similar about my girl but she was everything to me

And of the thousands of beautiful women I have seen since I last saw her face, I want none a fraction as much

This is a *fact*

I've been slaving over forgetting it, though.
