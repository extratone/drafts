To want, we must suffer
To suffer, we must want
We must want to suffer

I know it is not my place to want you so much
when your want could wane
or escape

Play me back and forth,
and I swear!
I will harbor nothing toward you
There is nothing toward you but
affections from some deep
violent
trench

*Swell! Oh, swell! Please!*

Violence is not of me lately

Sit up and be aware of this creature in me
or perhaps don't

I  -  at least  -  never saw
the merit in lying to you about my state of construction
the progress of the project
doesn't need to be kept secret?
I like it.
