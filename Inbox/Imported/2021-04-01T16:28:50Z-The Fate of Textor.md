# The Fate of Textor
I'd come across mention of it multiple times throughout this whole thing - an app that was described repeatedly as "[the iOS equivalent of TextEdit](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/textor-the-ios-equivalent-of-textedit-integrated-with-files/)," and - from what I can tell - the only software that has ever been able to actually edit text files on an iPhone. That headline is more than enough to warrant you immediately clicking the first App Store link you come across, right? I cannot even say how desirable that capability is given the Git-enabled workflow I’m currently going for. (It would make it up… Actually reasonable, probably.) Unfortunately, actually engaging with that URL only lead you here:

…and then your inevitable Google search immediately following *that* will look a lot like this:
![](The%20Fate%20of%20Textor/Photo%20Mar%204,%202021%20at%20013030.jpg)
…which will lead you straight to this fucking Tweet:
> PSA: I’m removing all my apps, including Textor, OpenTerm and Pixure, from the App Store. My GitHub repos will stay up but will not receive any updates.

And really, you don’t even have to scroll at all past the first reply… [Your final, disappointing stop](https://twitter.com/LouisDhauwe/status/1053869356122234880).
> My App Store career has been very fun. I first learned to program by making iPhone apps back in 2009. I would have never believed back then that 9 years later I would work on Xcode.    
> I applied once before at Apple (last year), without luck.  
> Always dream and never give up!
