should I try to remember when I finally let go and let my home in? After all those years of watching *Star Trek* and lonely, far-away men.
hours and hours I watched them and how they missed Earth. I must've missed Earth with them,
inside
out of the heat
*nine years!*
I distinctly remember taking my time to roll my papers in front of *Voyager* until the last acceptable minute to leave
and face the heat

damn, did I fight. to think I took five or six times the recommended dose of antihistamines until my heart raced! just to clear some air way.

but slowly, I was losing ability
ammunition against reality
and this year,
I have not taken antihistamines
sure, it's not even July yet but I've tested it!

took big risks I was sure to suffer from.

but my body and me, we have made peace with the Earth. finally, too tired to fight
I just lay down
and am not consumed by beetles or asphyxiated by pollen

I just went to sleep
and the Earth I have expended who knows how much energy to stave away
housed me.

my dear solemn moon,
she watches over me!
solemn and I at one
and we know each other so there's need for no word

I could've sworn the fescue heads were poison,
but now they hide me
they hold my way in the drain

all these old enemies have been waiting for me to tucker out
like a toddler
and did not filth me while I was exhausted on the ground
and I feel silly in a way so desperately precious,
so wanted for, I had forgotten how to breathe

and I think it'll be over by the end of the year and who will I be?
I think I'll be a member of a family
