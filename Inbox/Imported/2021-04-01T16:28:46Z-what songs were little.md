what songs were little
touches on a sleepy face
knots ever tied in twine,
irritating attempted departures,
longed for Ushuaia,
miraged in transparent timelessness
one marble abstract that was so dutifully opaque

stepping down, shedding away
first,
atop the molding shingle lattice in my window
then,
to half-finished promises I'dve bought again

finally perhaps,
propped candid on the ledge
over which I lean

*the last outpost*
nearer than farther,
now,
my time to leap
over my world's end
