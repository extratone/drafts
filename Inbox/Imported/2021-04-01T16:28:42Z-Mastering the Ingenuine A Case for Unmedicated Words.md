# Mastering the Ingenuine: A Case for Unmedicated Words
*Crippling* is a favorite modifier of “depression.” It’s certainly crippled my ability to write an intriguing lead.

Somehow — even after witnessing the continually-metamorphosing state of “blogging” from the front row — it's remained difficult to comprehend the consequences (or lack thereof) of discussing one’s more personal experiences for an audience that *still* hasn’t figured out how intimate (or not) it'd like its writers to be.

I raised myself on what you'd think would be the least-inward medium around - automotive and technology magazines. As I've consumed them, though, I've discovered that it is a particular balance of (read: conflict between) tactile critique and reflective narrative that *actually* makes up my preferred autowriting. I think a lot of us originally find it essential (when reading) to be reminded of a writer's "humanity," to varying intermittency. That is the cliche, at least.

It is more effectively analyzed from the perspective of *relevevance*, though. If every car magazine's introductory editorial was an elegy to whatever celebrity had perished between issues, it wouldn't take long for feedback in the general sentiment of "um... you okay?" to pour in from all manner of channels. Though when Denise McCluggage - the legendary driver, author and journalist - died last Spring, hundreds of tributes were appropriately published, and a good many were deeply personal stories. I believe the whole world should still be mourning, but ya know.

It would appear that a number of us have been anticipating an imminent (and inevitable) shift in web content's focus to depth and nuance for the past few years. Medium is an early example, I think, and Topolsky's *The Outline* is the most topical. As far as I can tell, the definitive marque of a "blog" is a lack of an external subject. We are all writing about ourselves as if it's relevant to any audience, and - for the most democratized of us - it is, apparently. If I'm honest with you (and myself,) I can't imagine consuming it, but have been *doing* it for years.

Radio and podcasting - as different as they are - have had us beat for years, though.
