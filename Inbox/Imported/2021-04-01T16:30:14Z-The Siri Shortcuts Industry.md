# The Siri Shortcuts Industry
Oh so as far as Shortcuts a thought is go I know you can't really like outrank Matthew Cassinelli Who I know that he was on the original team that made workflow I was on the impression that it was just him I think I think I was on that impression when I first started talking about us or shortcuts in that episode this year's ago because I just discovered the podcast super computer she go back and listen to those they're still available Yeah he does what's new in Shortcuts a Newsletter so I'll be throwing a I see it was John Gruber right now wasn't who the fuck didn't Matt Cassinelli interview recently anyway that's my feet I literally listen to it last night so she really know him and he's been able to Continue monetizing the software to hear what is advertised on the software that he built without without working for Apple ID he did for him OK so there's this like his he just released his updated Shortcuts library Which is definitely it looks great for sure it looks better than any of the other third-party Shortcut distribution webpages of course it would because if you notice like that if super computer is still around the branding is Like that very impeccable look all the icons on mats workouts for impeccable anyway So that he's going to a premium thing going on and you get like twice as many shortcuts if you pay them max raise get the same thing But you know they were there I didn't build it oh OK let me just say the thing about Cassinelli shortcuts him there is some sort of disconnect between the way that he uses them And the way that it occurs to me to use them So I just often on today browsed the free Shortcuts library that he released him I download a few but so many of them are literally just exist OK like the community one it's just a sign up for the slack I guess I think he's going for his library being an introduction To Shortcuts free for anyone I guess who has seen what's in the app in the officially endorsed Shortcuts gallery and him I want to do this if you're in that position That's as good a place as I need to start He said he's gonna start doing video content again his voice is very deliberate and calming and that's The opposite of me so N and a You're not again you just can't be ignored if somebody was there but OK I'm giving Sample the shortcut to sign up for The Shortcuts sharing slacker I kind of assumed when I opened the slack app I got a wait for something like I waited I was like that's rich that's like integrated joining that way but I get maybe it was just a link that out there it's skipping to the part in the process when you're sunny but a browser and it probably looks like I'm just skipping to the part that makes sense But nothing happened Three times they were just there so I went to grab it and looked at what was in the clipboard Because he does that so sure can see this and it's been it's perplexed me I know it's it's it should be really simple but Shortcuts always end up Or the user has to do some sort of action that just doesn't occur to me I guess and it's free it's my fault for not looking through the documentation but notably all the other shortcuts serve down from an ass where you have to you're a part of set up for configuration ever You know there's a big tax comment which I know it's probably not visually up to Sanders Official*that's OK if you're wondering why this isn't working you can go back and read this part Oh God I think this wireless charger is making this noise Oh no it's just the power supply But yeah I think when I first started like deliriously playing with it say what the fuck is happening I don't give you any further examples but just maybe a heads up If you're having trouble I'm also not afraid it's not like you're totally off but if you're if the type of person that actually wants to do this that she wants to mess around with Shortcuts yourself and Mike Miller is making them there's nothing they can do stuff for you But I just want to like if you or someone you know once and shortcuts that did you forewarned that that step two after the gallery I mean like a short cuts are a row I'm sure many other truck is in the gallery is not all And his third-party ones are just as considerate and robust there's not gonna be here you don't have anything to worry about for Matthew Cassinelli can't stress that enough We should make for a good start I guess I spoke with Casey Newton About a shortcut that he was trying to run they called the day is it service in the news the lake is AI to you know this wasn't the one that was in the news it was another that one makes people that animes old photos this one is just in mind and it just basically like turns you can turn colors like photographs into black-and-white looking over your house anyway it's someone God I found her name it's like Hot 250 or something on it and read it They wrote this forgot in 2019 if found its way to Casey Newton's iPhone via Liam came over his name In this for the space to demonstrate you know what you do a short cousin I wasn't fucking working and I was Basically I was like hey Kacey off I'll figure out I'll find the dude I'll look I'll ask around I did find the person and convince them that the shortcut wasn't working And surprise surprise it was a change between I was 13 and I was 14 This is the issue with Shortcuts And the conclusion that I'm going to come to you Is Perhaps it's radical After having I think I've gone pretty much as far as I can go without spending like two weeks in that horrible unintuitive Drag and drop Shortcut in her face like oh God like that I know these guys up and you know I made some absurdly complicated pieces of software automations but they're like do you think they update themselves or they have menus and like Easter eggs and this is all running off of Was basically just a fancy notification bar I get the fiddling OK and I get how exciting it is That we could do any like an any and all the stuff and I was I like any of those I've gotten as far as I can without really really losing a lot of time I have publish Shortcuts and I feel like we're just no one else it never occurred to anyone else like turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi that's not it that's the number one I mean it's too actions to fall actions will have to gather I may work on a shortcut that gets OK If I ever like the most complicated one will be one that gets a list of all the apps installed on your phone and So it'll be actually a links and then takes that list to Drafts and Drafts has a thing as an action it's really fucking amazing to me where it takes a URL and it outputs a titled mark down like so it escapes the title in the webpage he leaving dress that's behind his fucking thing and I wish I discovered earlier I'm gonna work actually learning fast but after this And any creates like a numbers list or a database of apps that are currently installing your phone With all of them hyperlink to their App Store links And I will consider myself Frankly that's all the development that I need to do for a very long time it's not the rest of my life OK I didn't get or another just Like my mother there's no reason for her to even worry about what shortcuts are Unless I don't know if she wanted to open a web page in chrome a lot Instead of Safari and she wanted to put it on her home screen that's one thing we're like you can make a shortcut and I have a custom icon that just says open this URL in chrome I did that for The one it's because it's the same thing as Adams Street in Safari and that's like slightly smoother by a few milliseconds because it's not a shortcut anyway Basically like I don't think I could I don't like it like if I was determined to find a Shortcut and a Shortcut my mom could use ride early should be using regular there's not one in Shortcuts that I use the most Are I have one where it's just a series of letters I thought I do the type to Siri so I can hold the the sleep wake button type of Siri comes up I put in the series of letters and then see what the shortcut without leaving that screen that copies my password For my iCloud password to the clipboard Know if you wanted to steal my shit I'm fairly confident that I have not included that sure if it in my follow back ups that would be very dumb I also think I want to get Hobbs get us some like very weirdly intuitive morning shit Services that was the file how are you supposed to on the new rebel and I just yeah but if you want to steal my should I answer that's fine That would be something I can write about AnyWho so there's that that one's on that I've made recently and it's literally one action and I think that's the one that I was going to say all the shortcuts are things that they use regularly are things that Apple should've implemented anyway like but when I say it all of them I really just referring to the turn Bluetooth and Wi-Fi off I just really wish Yeah anyway And it's like the shortcuts that I have used when I wasn't like really into it it's just us that's it it is nice because I am I losing weight I can just say hey S word cut and then she runs that and so I can turn losing Wi-Fi off from across the room which It's nice and situations like that your phone is connected to a Bluetooth speaker and it's blasting it and you're allowed in the toilet and your phones across the room and I yeah In theory do a Marco polo shirt short that were like you've lost your phone on you now because if you ask where are you should've says I'm here do you a Marco Polo's work over it it's like that loud sound so you can find it it's cute it never works though yeah it does is it just the sounds works fine And there is one more that I can think of I am
