I cannot determine if I -
in the fairytale -
dwindle

if I do,
I'll tell you,
and I know you'd listen

you always listen

perhaps -
if that is the making of my love -
I am vain,
but then,
we are perfectly vain, together,
aren't we?

you know I'm still convinced I have a lot to say,
but it seems to be ever-escaping me

I suppose my mind has not taken well to my ill-treatment of it,
but these are the necessities we make

naturally, I am hesitant to say you're necessary
because I am afraid of the power necessity gives,
but I cannot bring myself to fear you,
and that -
they say -
is trust
