There is no longer reason to fight *them*
There is no longer reason to wash *them* off me

I wear them on me
I wallow in inpreferential information and speech
There is no longer any reason to struggle for the faculties to keep me clean
Steered by wind like a flag of them

I belong to the nothing and everything now and what if I one day forget?

Have I failed, then?
That is for me to decide, but I'm sure I look it

I will spend much of my time defending myself, I'm sure
in the interest of understanding myself or perhaps providing the guidance that I did not have
Does that make me a philanthropist?
No, it simply makes me want for some occupation

It is not pride
You'll never know how small such a thing is when She lives

It is not martyrdom
She is the only authority

It is not lust
She is the whole of my lust

It is not self-pity
There is no dichotomy; I have never stopped wanting Her in my arms

It is not malice
She is precious by name

*want nothing to do with*

I don't think I can make it hurt anymore,
noticeably
it's a bag of litter in the reef
