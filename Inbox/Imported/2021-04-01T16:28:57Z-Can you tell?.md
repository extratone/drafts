Can you tell?
I'm wishing it was a given
You were There
which was sometimes little more than another
source of heat for the sheets
Heat
I remember your sensitivity of and about it
I will try to hold onto you You & Heat
I will not forget bringing you more blankets
I will not forget the meter of it I decided
best to keep in operation, somewhere
Just to be There
throughout it all
Next to me,
watching tremors of others pass through the glass
So precious and I knew it
