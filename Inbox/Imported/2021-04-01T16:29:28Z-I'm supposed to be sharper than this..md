I'm supposed to be sharper than this.
I am a risk.
I sit with my brother outside the Diner at three on a Thursday morning.
I sign with a fucking ballpoint the book I brought to *trade for a good story* and give it to ___ because he mentions his affinity for reading, and is as much of a steward of the place in which pieces of it were written as the other four. (Dave, Esther, Ashley? and ___)
Here we all have been noticeably *left*.
I set my recorder down.
*that's not on us, right?*
but they flourish in its encircling spotlight, anyway
this is what I learned tonight

and immediately, we must talk about menstrual blood because - I guess it's a unifying mystery for all of us.

I've always found it boring.

but then we discuss - in this communal huddle against the loneliness of our truths - *Vegas*, the nonchalant sanctuary of Sin & Vice
and who has been,
and who has *done* too much time
and why we would or would not go
and not why I, the youngest
am as them, left
so early.

I want to be honest about my lack of earnestness.

I am not curious but I *must be curious*
I must see and hear from the Other faces
Other Other Other faces,
presences,
names,
whom my preference would not needlessly scorn
Needless Needless Needless
the again-moved, newly-time limited piano sits,
awaiting a forecasted storm
