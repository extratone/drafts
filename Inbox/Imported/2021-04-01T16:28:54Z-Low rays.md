Low rays
Anticipating the night but not in rest from turmoil
I will maintain contact with the steering wheel and it's always nice when my hands don't sweat

We captured something
Stole it

Or maybe we've cheated in every possible way
But I have come to love existence most with you

I feel I must study it
Probably my only sentiment I've nearly regretted

Sunrise & Sunset
There are two of each

A beginning or an ending
Our air is warming
Like you taught me to love it
