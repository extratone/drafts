Ghosts are not charred monsters hiding in the basement
We are near you, probably
but haunting is differently differential,
much to storytellers' disdain

Hanging around is not one thing
it is the only thing, for various reasons
and shames,
depending on wraith ages

Purposelessness is the true hell that borned your villains

When there can be no more loss, some pursue malicious entertainment to bide the time
in the wait for our actual nothing

nothing nothing nothing

that is what darkness is

The manager of the other store likes to keep one of those daily tear-off musing things on the counter.

On my first visit in awhile, the day asks

*If you were in space, what would you hear?*

It was night and slow, so I took the time to probe for a trick. On finding none, I asked the cashier how many people had gotten it wrong.

*Most*, she said

Then you really don't know?
Not once in your life have you ever considered pondering enough such a nearby thing to warrant seeking such a preciously absolute truth?

For we know that even the most inabject effort would speedily lead to a clear answer, do we not?

*Do we not?*

Dear oh dear,
have I a task to keep me occupied

Most writers in time would now ask *what is my purpose here?*
which is another one of those bewilderingly useless sentences they like to salvage from history's Murmur Ocean

Pitiable, as it were, that so much neurofire leads so many only to an elevated articulation of nonsense

while I am simply proud of myself for mustering such a definite positional accusation

That is the real truth of the world
It is silent

My haphazard holiday through the conversational bleaklands is to what I refer ye objector

Most of what you have ever thought you shit to satisfy a web of misdirected necessitated justifications

A healthy husky must be *put to work* perceptively, lest he retain his primal (semifaux) self-worth
For all of his days, he looks at his pack and himself to be assured that he is making himself valuable
But if he could hear an informant persuade him to attend some other system, he would be *free*, no?
He would be free to seek alternative incentives of dopamine production
Maybe a majestic dog would shoot up

Yeah well,
breath is wasted educating another being about the breath he's wasted,
yes?

But
what is *waste*?

What is any word that dares ask so much from you as assumption?

Rephrase?

Alright,
define your *right* and *wrong*

There is nothing to say
in the silence of space
