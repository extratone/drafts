This morning, I walked by Meagan's house in the mist. I walked all the way downtown, in fact.

Just stepping on her street was a huge undertaking, but I've realized that I've changed more in the past year than ever, and I think I wish I could get that message to Meagan.

I ended up calling a cab to go home, which was cool. It was my first time taking a taxi, and I didn't have any cash to tip the driver with. I need to remember that I owe him a tip because I promised him I'd deliver one day.

I ended up having a few dreams about Meagan that made me feel pretty awful when I woke up. After about 30 minutes of thinking in bed, though, I think I made some sort of peace with the inevitability of everything. I think maybe this is some sort of transition into the acceptance stage. Meagan is still the most important thing in the world to me, though, and I would like to talk to her again. Even if my future role is that of a distant friend, I'd like to be in her life.
