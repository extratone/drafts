It is not good to be only a poet
My words can be thrown around but my books' are heavy
In and of myself,
I am nothing
There is little reason for me to be paid

But I am still finding myself returning to them for peace

Maybe my only attention these days is in the way words are arranged

When the neighbors wake up I become sleepy
and it is my duty to no one but existence to learn when This will come
and how to make it stay
and what it is I do that makes it go away
and to determine what concerns I meddle as close to regular as I am able

The *I* key on my keyboard was broken a bit
But I can not have that
Why is it so funny that I cannot have that?
