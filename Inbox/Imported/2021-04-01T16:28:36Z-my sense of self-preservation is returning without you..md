my sense of self-preservation is returning without you.
my heart is now like no place on Earth - utterly silent, save for a hydrogen bomb detonation every other season.
an expanse, lightening ever so slowly by glow from below.
though I fell so far, so quickly into nothing from you, I had begun the crawl back home because I had nothing else to do,
there,
but my first sunrise stirred some peculiar conviction.
I am not waiting for you anymore.
this thing which I have mistreated is turning conduit to vessel.
and I wait to die, but I shall not go quietly.
