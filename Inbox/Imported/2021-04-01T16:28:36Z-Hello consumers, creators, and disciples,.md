Hello consumers, creators, and disciples,

I am late with *two* letters this time. I'd apologize, but you've already stopped reading.

**Six** (also included below)
**Five**

The truth is, I am still a mere student of email, with a whole world's worth of knowledge left to assimilate. I know that brevity is important but uhhhh... I've never had much.

Thanksgiving coincides conveniently with our half-birthday, so showing appreciation for your participation has been on my mind.

So. **Thank you**.
