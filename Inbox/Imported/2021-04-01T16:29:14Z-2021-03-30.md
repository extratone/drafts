Using mom's computer to keep up with the upcoming coverage of the Star Trek convention in Las Vegas. I'm really excited, actually. Whoa I'm gonna try to pair mom's Bluetooth keyboard with my phone.

So I think Gary is taking a shower, which means he's regained some mobility.  Otherwise though, he's still weak.  The first day I was with him, he did nothing but vomit.  I was thinking about working on Kuvak's biography today, but I don't know if I'll be able to stay focused.

I haven't taken Adderall in a very long time and I've been feeling pretty good because of that. #keys
