Bobitts about me,
what should be stars have been made
They are my things to pick up and wheel around if I have the whim
as my childhood model airplanes
on top of the electric fireplace

But I maybe leave them for a while they would cry long

or for a weekend,
never leave them alone

sleepy child sleeps

out and about just to be carried around

To follow someone bigger in a daze
but unable to dream
