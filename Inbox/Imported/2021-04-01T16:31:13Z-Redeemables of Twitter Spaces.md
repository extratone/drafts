# Redeemables of Twitter Spaces
When I found myself hanging out with [a complete stranger](https://twitter.com/blondekneestan) from Britney Spears fan Twitter and just Shooting The Shit (not obsessively trying to record the conversation with my janky Android Emulator-Audacity setup,) I actually had a lot of fun. I feel like I talked too much but I was at least able to make them laugh when I described Old Thresher’s get-togethers. Glad one more person knows that Paris Hilton is a Ham Radio sage. Obviously (or perhaps not,) though, it was *they*, the human, and their nature that made the experience great. It wasn’t any native feature of Spaces that brought us together, but the opposite: manually searching the spaces URL.
