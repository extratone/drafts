blessed are the gaps in the noise, I guess.
despite this thing which I have so relentlessly tried to enrich. which I do almost habitually, simply because I can. does that make it reckless?
I guess.
I say *good morning*, as is customary and reassuring for these neighbors who wouldn't be unjustified in regarding me as a feature of the landscape. like an o gauge locomotive, varied in activity, but never path. it's strange how differently I write now - less wary of pretentiousness, mayhaps - than I was with Her, anyway. three years ago today, I mentioned my job interview at the station. this Thursday, I have one with a marketing company. I should probably cut my hair.
