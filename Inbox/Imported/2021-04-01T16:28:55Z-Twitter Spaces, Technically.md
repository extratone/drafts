# Twitter Spaces, Technically
- [ ] When did Twitter buttons stop appearing on user profiles in the Periscope app?

## Some basic observations after use
* An applause emoji react/some other way for listeners to say “YES! what you are saying!! that!!!” is **absolutely essential**, asap.
* Some way for speakers to queue their own additions/anecdotes/questions to add to the conversation is an opportunity for actual (possibly very profound) innovation in Spaces. 
* A step in the request process that gives a potential speaker the opportunity to at least briefly sum up why they would like to speak -> presented to the host in a way that’s optimized for digestion on the fly. (Yes, this involves *text functionality*.)
* Live captions are better than you’d think! So there’s a point for accessibility.

- [ ] Emoji reactions are okay, but I see no reason why you wouldn’t expand the possible choices to include the whole of the current emoji library, right? I will consider myself silenced until I am able to react with the Moyai emoji.

- [ ] Losing access to **Periscope Producer** is huge!

- [ ] In a more banal sense, omission of text chat also prevents engagement from folks in regular day-to-day life situations where turning on one’s mic  would be inappropriate (BUS,) pointless (any loud, outdoor and/or workplace setting,) or otherwise infeasible (late night with sleeping roommates.) Yet another one of those original internet promises: being able to listen and engage in these situations. And guess what? It feels *natural*! Entirely! A space with 3 audible speakers and ~5 or so fairly regularly-engaged text chat participants is an absolute blast!
