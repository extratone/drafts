this is the strange way of between times like this
narrowing
which to me always meant less routes of escape
but me is *definitely* playing around
I know for certain as my back meets with the grasspeckled ground for the first time in *at least* ten years, probably more
I am being cautious when I've never had less to lose
I am being timid with you
I am still flabbergasted by my anticipation of your presence. I'd forgotten it.
and Gone - the twin
Presence and Absence,
leaning again
creaking as I go further every few times
maybe we both wonder if I'm brittle
maybe not.

strangely, it's in a rational way, I swear
I'm measured and it would seem to be taking my whole effort to just wade. I can't tell if it's asking a lot to take my hand
and that is the source of the intoxication
