# congruence
the seasons *do* change
this alien mess

it's tiring.
we're both doing our best.

maybe it is just that we are both cowards?
or comrades
trapped in an incongruent typhoon

maybe it is just that her little house
by its lonesome on Smith street,
became Holy when I first felt accompanied
one incensed sanctuary of an aged sort

we are bound together by a mutual understanding of our imminent destruction?
or perhaps it is amusement with it.
or martyrdom
