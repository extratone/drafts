At home watching the new Top Gear. I forgot how good this program is. Just went to the Devil's Icebox. A picture is attached. It was much more interesting than it was when I was a kid.  It makes me want to do something interesting that involves travel. GEOLOGY

I'm supposed to be cleaning my room.

But I'm going to hang out at Kaleb's.
