# The Premium Experience
I don’t think I ever regarded “premium smartphone experience” as a valid, useful, and reasonable differentiator (and I think I was right about that up until the past 5 years or so.) I’ve already forgotten who it was (and in what context) I heard (I think it was Federico) remark on what I’m starting to  finally realize is the true primary reason behind the ever-amplifying interest in iOS over desktop-class operating systems: the volume of developer attention / pressure / innovation / competition on this platform is *so* much larger than it’s ever been on desktop OS development in the whole of computing history, and especially much larger than the latter is *right now*.
