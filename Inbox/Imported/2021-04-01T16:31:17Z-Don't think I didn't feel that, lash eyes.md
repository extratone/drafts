Don't think I didn't feel that, lash eyes
Hung eyes
which I am upon

Why do we do this thing we do?
Which is infatuation, I guess
Mutual, I hope but it'd only be a tool
to know you more

I hope you don't think I didn't feel that contact you gave me on the corners
You let us touch and I know it's not a big deal, right?
The most important thing to a young woman being
enjoying yourself
To a young man too, I guess.
But damn girl.
I'm looking at you like I want you to do this talking thing forever.
Like I want to show up on somebody else's porch with you and give em some polished Us
right?

Right the way you move
girl.
I cannot be in-love with you?
Maybe it is best,
the unusuality of my don't know

You that is infectually hidden behind those eyes
that are you,
too.
Fuck.
Goddamn lashes got me in a mess.
Goddamn being got me in a mess.
Hope you don't figure out this mess till we're well a thing

but isn't it conceited to say?
*Yes, of course We are!*

Good God, I haven't lost that much.

We are not Yet but I'm Ready to make It

I'm pounding it out.

I'm thinking about how much maybe you'd like holding me.

I hope it is a lot.

I'm thinking about the least responsibility & closest wishes.
Wishes wishes
Tell me *wishes*
Yours and those you'd think were yours,
too
Tell me all the things you want to do
List me all the places you want to go
Sugar not so much so I can't say you'll go on mine
But maybe We'll go and be both Mines

Maybe you're My eyes and I'm Your voice
maybe I'm not whatever
maybe we'll be together.
