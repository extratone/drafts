The Deft Damned Living are everywhere you're trying not to look. They want, but refuse to know it. They speak, but do not hear themselves.

I've been here
in my corner of the cacophony, trying to figure out how I can profit from telling them, yet nothing wants to be heard for free, even.

I don't even know if I am going to live anymore, if you'd like me to play honest.

I don't think I'm even restless anymore because my foundation has been taken away.

Now, I am the Deft Damned Living, but at least I will always know what I want.

I've seen her car; I know where she lives, my only desire in existence. In a matter of minutes, I could force my presence upon her. She has mediocre situational awareness.
But - for better or worse - voluntaryism is integral to the desire.

I'll tell you, though, I feel I may burst if I am without the sound of her voice any longer.

I told her this in an email, recently, but have received no response.

I'm not worried about explaining anything to the world, if I'm honest, but I suppose there's no harm in biding my remaining breaths in any whim, right?

Here I am, lamenting in near-commoners language. Perhaps if I could feel at all, I would be disgusted with myself.

Dear God, though! *What now?!*

*Alright then, reason of my living. You wish to have no further contact with me. Perhaps as a last favor, though, you could tell me what I should do now?*

*What now.*
