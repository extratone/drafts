I spent a huge portion of my childhood daydreaming. Often, it was about all the things companionship would entail - hence The Mechanism. Somehow, I'd forgotten for a few months until now how essential (?) (or at least prevalent) such daydreaming has been in my life.

I used to spend a fair amount of time at the station daydreaming about a me with virtually-unlimited finances and the *Iowa* as a sort of flagship - a modernized anarchocapitalist utopia, sustained and sailing the world, always available as my haven (read: plaything.)

It would all be enabled by Jaime and Aime, the mobile and infrastructural forms of my perfect artificial intelligence.

I would employ all of my friends, of course, and together, we'd create grandiose extrapolations of my current properties. (Including *Honk* as a Top Gear-inspired series with a huge budget.)
