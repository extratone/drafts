Every sense is intake, interception, exchange. Elements of perception are less sovereign compartments, more clusters of gradiented association. A man is nothing more than an absorber and his shadow. As a human being, I - as you - am required by limited faculty to use approximation as my singular tool of vision.

This is a collection - a record, if you will - of the failures and successes of my own approximations.

There is always another decimal - always another detail. The fabric of humanity is maintained not by comradic love, but by perpetual, designed omission.

And - by the human pillar of "dishonesty" - to omit is to lie. To make finite what is infinite so that life may continue is to lie. To live is to lie.

Blemished as our space is, we must teach our children in definitive terms. We must be convincing in our absolutes.

Little oval of sight, my lamplight.
A slice of truth in the loud, windy, moonless ocean of soil I border. Swaying heads of seed
brushing me. I can't see all of them at once.
I need a brighter lamp.
I guess I need the sun.
