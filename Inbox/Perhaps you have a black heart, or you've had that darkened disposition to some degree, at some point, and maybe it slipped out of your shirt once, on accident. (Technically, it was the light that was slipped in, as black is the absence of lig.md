Perhaps you have a black heart, or you've *had* that darkened disposition to some degree, at some point, and maybe it slipped out of your shirt once, on accident. (Technically, it was the light that was slipped in, as black is the absence of light.)

Perhaps you knew how to use it toward an end that saved you from something. Perhaps you didn't, but your darkness did, and you have something evil to thank for your presence, this moment. Perhaps you and your heart are just awfully lucky.

But what if one were to become curious about how to effectively use his evil for his own gain? How much to show; how much to feed.

What if he knew he could kill, and needed an opponent to know, tactfully. Flash a gun? Reach for the steel in his voice.
