Here we are, perhaps inevitably. I have moved all the traces of my presence from the house that I could fit in Nevermore. I am at the hipster coffee shop - the camera is with me. Perhaps on another occasion I would've brought it as an accessory to my convenient journalism student facade, but today, it is purely out of necessity. It is the second most expensive item I own - Nevermore being the first.

And thank goodness for massive handhelds and Bluetooth keyboards, I guess. And I can thank myself for surviving the past year and a half, I guess. And I guess I want her role to fade so that I may continue surviving.

Mom loves to play the cast-out narrative, but I am legitimately unbothered. Throwing away my first hairdryer today caused me significantly more distress. The absence of the truck is exponentially more dangerous to my mood.

I published in the Colonel's Journal only last night about my newfound sense of duty to the MBC, yet here I am, unperturbed by the thought of near-complete absence from Eve for an unknown length of time.

I'd do better hidden away at the back, brewing the horrible associations I have become so infamous in afflicting.

The auction of extratone.com ends in 4 days - as of now, I am still the highest bidder (as I would expect.) In this moment, I consider preemptively writing the introduction piece for...whatever it is that is really changing about Drywall Media. Plenty of logo ideas, but I don't think they really require archival.

Somehow, I retained ~15 Vyvanse 30mg pills for the 5(?) years since I was last prescribed. I took one approximately an hour ago...we'll see how it goes, I suppose.

Brent has offered me his couch for "as long as [I] need." I'm bringing my camera. If I had to suppose, Children of the Corn 30's potential release date has just gained great immediacy.

TOO MUCH LEMON JUICE

Lily's gotta freeclimb. Or would she consider it ignorant? Perhaps her extraordinary comprehension of the risk actually enhances the thrill.

Baskerville, ye fast friend!

Muriya Mordu truly is as legendary in the Navy as you'd suppose. I have met him in ceremony three times, shaking hands in the manner which doesn't include an expectation of rememberance. He is of the engaging family of genius, most certainly. There is never another of his kind in the room; this much I have gathered.

More recently, I have observed the envy of his highly-advanced and rapidly-multiplying fleet in the State, but it never occurred to me that I'd be in the position to partake in his Legion's ingenuity.

Though the *Jazer* represents an impressive long-range platform, and perhaps the ultimate manifestation of our beloved Raven, the nature of our newly-acquired threats necessitates a more agile flagship until we reap the required resources to lay down the *Jipthael*'s hull.

Hence, our new purchase and christening of the *Maale-akrabbim, Ascent of Scorpions*, a *Garmur*-class fast frigate, and the *Jedaiah, hand of the Lord*, the *Orthrus*-class cruiser that shall serve as my flagship in the meantime.

Both are of the fastest available vessels in their respective classes.

The colony on [**REDACTED**] over which we have assumed watch graciously hosted a celebration for *Jedaiah*'s christening. Festive rockets were fired at the rounded angles of her passively-stealthy profile. I (more or less) ordered that everyone under my command enjoy themselves for this precious holiday. Symbolism - after all - founds the role of the flagship.

My living quarters these past few months have been divided between the familiar destitution of the *Jazer*'s blue hues and the haunting and ghoulish corridors of *Maon*. In my youth, I'd have given anything for the chance to stay aboard such a substantial Blood Raider relic, and though that intrigue has not deserted me completely, this expedition of mine is no trifle indulgence.

I established my reputation for favoring those subordinates I find especially intriguing early on in my career as an officer. So established was it, in fact, that the occupying subjects were unofficially dubbed "The Colonel's Jests." I don't recollect it in vanity, but in something near regret. I can only hope any professional favoritism I allowed to slip did not have grand consequences for any under my command. These few jokesters shared my sense of humor - an essential, in my opinion, to the optimal nurturing of a starship's crew culture.

I would not blame you for concluding the humor to be of the cliche Navy sort; crude pranks, and the like, but in fact, I much prefer stupendous thought associations related to the more-surreal aspects of our occupation.

As such, I immediately put to rest the few simpleton pranks designed to ease the uneasiness of the haunted outpost. We are not ten jumps-deep in friendly space anymore. Over its desolate planetary anchor, *Maon*'s shield generators buzz her bubble, constant - our only real defense against the dangers of the wilderness just 25 km. from my berth.

With *Jedaiah*'s construction and commemoration behind us, I have decided to take up permanent residence in her minimalist Captain's quarters. Where the dark caverns of *Maon* moan and howl, and the *Jazer*'s corridors creak under any little strain, our new Cruiser only whirs and singes, her interior as compact and purposeful as her profile is tactical.

And the *purple*!

A light tinge of the royal hue is in every surface - static and display - surrounding me in a concise blanket of intelligent design.

Energy is the purest intake of the cultural machine - we spend our whole psychological reality manipulating the nuances of its refraction to project the image we desire to be seen.

∆

Even in plenty, scrub your holds clean. I've known the luxury of waste, and have learned when it has a place in your time, and when it does not. I look out over our quivering new empire and declare:
Now is not the time.

Scrub your holds clean.

I stopped by the school of music and found - quite perfectly - an unused practice room with a beautiful moderately-loved Yamaha baby grand. I don't remember what time it was when I got there, but I would wager that I spent at least 3.5 undisturbed hours on it. I shall be returning as often as I can.

∆

I must remember to include a child character named Urn in *Blimp's Burden.* Jordan Shearer and his girlfriend (I can never remember her name) just visited the diner and sat in the table right in front of mine. They acknowledged me, but did not appear interested in further engagement, which makes me wonder if the punks actually dislike me. I have just taken my third 30mg Vyvanse pill today... I hope I survive. I think it was Collin who mentioned the possibility of liver damage from all of my stimulant abuse. I don't know why it hadn't occurred to me... A primal trust in institutional medicine, I suppose.

Mom sent me the following SMS:

*"Sent this to your siblings
Today is a sad day for me David has moved out at least for now.  It is sad because I always thought he would leave to go to college or to take a job in auto journalism after graduating from MU.  That is not his plan at least for the moment.  He is planning on staying with friends and will come home to do laundry etc.  the positive side of this is that whatever plans he makes they are his own.  I was very tearful at first but then after thinking and praying I realize that he is strong capable  and he has resources.  My dad at 20 flunked out of Tulane university engineering school tried to join the navy air force or army but was too skinny so he went into the merchant marines during WW11.  That is when his adventures began he traveled the world.  I am sure he broke his mother's heart because her vision of his life changed putting him in harms way not safe in college. As David drove away I had a flash back to the little boy I tried so hard to protect the child so intelligent and interested in the world, that little one  still lives in David's heart.  As I let go and trust that God will watch over him I know that David will be ok I know this because of who he is deep down in his soul, he is resilient strong and smart just like his grandfather.  He also has all of you who love him dearly and will have his back if needed love mom"*

I suppose it must be time to sit back and let God pay my bills.
