Eryn's childhood best friend, Mary is going to Ecuador soon, but she stopped by Columbia with her girl, Rachel, so the four of us met up at Rock Bridge State Park. I think I let Eryn see that I was upset last night - she's smart enough to know why - but I did not see guilt in her eyes, which could indicate a respect I have never thoroughly gotten.

I'm feeling pretty rotten inside right now, but at least some of it is probably due to sleep deprivation.
