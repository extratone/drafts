We're now watching *Johnny Tsunami*. I remember empathizing with the father - a businessman who hates Hawaii and loves Vermont - even at age 7-9. Brent believes I read too much into the enslavery of the Smart House. He's probably right.

I'm gonna need the Vyvanse pill I just took to tackle the intellectual complexities of Johnny's world.

Possible sequel plots include:
-Instead of accepting Vermont's lack of waves, Johnny's grandfather assists him in sacrificing Emily to the Hawaiian Gods and unleashes an era of unkempt warmth and relentless Tsunamis on the East Coast.
